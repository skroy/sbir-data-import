The number of Americans living with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) is estimated to
double to 13.8 million people by 2050, with minoritized individuals affected disproportionately. Cognitive,
physical, and social activities can improve quality of life, cognition, and behavioral and psychological
symptoms of dementia (BPSD), but access, engagement, and adherence are challenging. ADRD specialists
are expensive and inaccessible for daily support, especially for persons living with dementia (PL WD) from
minoritized backgrounds who cannot find culturally competent providers. Support groups do not provide
scalable, individualized, evidence-based skills or daily guidance, and caregivers are already overburdened
assisting with activities of daily living. Commercial solutions to support PLWD are not culturally responsive or
scalable for daily, affordable use. There is an increasingly unmet need for culturally relevant, accessible, and
scalable ADRD care. We are developing a personalized and culturally responsive virtual coaching platform to
engage and support PLWD in evidence-based cognitive and physical activities in order to enhance health and
well-being. Our novel technology leverages advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to facilitate activities from peer-reviewed interventions at lower costs. In each session, an
avatar is used to guide and support the PLWD through evidence-based cognitive and physical activities. To
engage PLWD, our NLP-based system adapts the coach’s dialogue based on input shared by the PLWD and
their family on key aspects of the PLWD's life history and culture (e.g., favorite holidays, music genres, foods).
The avatar coach also has characteristics tailored to the PLWD’s preferences (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender,
age) and offers social support to encourage adherence with check-ins, praise, and motivational words. Our
user interface is designed for PLWD to easily speak to and see their personal virtual coach on a large-screen
device with a microphone and camera (e.g., iPad, computer). In Phase 1, we will develop a personalized and
culturally responsive virtual coach prototype that delivers evidence-based cognitive and physical activities and
test initial usability/feasibility for racially and ethnically diverse persons with mild ADRD and their caregivers.
By digitizing activities and increasing personal and cultural relevance, the coaching platform will support PLWD
and their caregivers by improving access, engagement, and adherence to evidence-based interventions to
enhance health and well-being.",  ,,,,EMILY S WANG,,(650) 505-7382,emilyswang@alumni.harvard.edu,,  ,

If broadly adopted, this solution will reduce annual carbon emissions by about 0.5 gigatons annually and bring air conditioning to the point of affordability for many of the two billion people who increasingly need it, but can’t afford it. The global AC market is about $120 Billion annually and the industry has been served essentially by the same vapor compression technology invented over a century ago. That technology is inefficient and, for vast numbers of people around the world, unaffordable due to its large electricity expense. The proposed technology has the potential to disrupt this market by providing a two-thirds reduction in power use. This project also has the potential to lead to the commercialization of a new class of membranes that can increase the efficiency and decrease the cost associated with high-salinity fluid treatment applications such as lithium recovery, wastewater treatment, and water desalinization. _x000D_
_x000D_
This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel, hollow-fiber membrane technology tailored to operate with high flux in a liquid desiccant AC system. Commercial off-the-shelf membranes are not designed for this high-concentration environment and, if used in a commercial implementation of the system, would drive its size and cost to the point which would limit the product’s marketability. This project’s objective is to demonstrate a customized membrane design and quantify the membrane’s impact on the proposed AC system’s efficiency, size, and cost.The proposed research will accomplish this by a series of design/fab/test iterations followed by an update to the system and techno-economic models using the measured characteristics of the final membrane. This solution will broaden membrane developers’ understanding of the design and potential of high-concentration membranes. Beyond its applicability to the liquid desiccant cooling technology, a high-concentration membrane would have broad applicability to multiple high brine concentration applications, including mineral recovery operations such as performed during lithium mining, zero liquid discharge wastewater treatments, and high-brine water desalination pursued in arid regions of the world._x000D_

Here, single-cell microbes are engineered to produce valuable metabolites using enzymes rather than sourcing these chemicals from petroleum. Developing genetically engineered cell strains with high yield remains an ongoing effort due to the complexities in how genetic code leads to phenotype expression. This problem is addressed using a bottom-up approach to screen microbe populations at the single-cell level. The method deployed to identify metabolite content in individual cells is based on infrared (IR)-absorption spectroscopy which is label-free, quantitative, and non-destructive.Synthetic biology is poised to disrupt the chemical value-chain by providing an alternative to petroleum-based chemicals that is sustainable and carbon-neutral.Once a highly productive cell is identified it can be selectively propagated to create enriched cell lines. Innovations in optical microscopy are required to improve the performance of the cell screening instruments, which will allow high-resolution focusing across a broad spectral range. The upgraded platform will optimize yield more quickly, providing value by reducing the upfront cost to develop new industrial cell strains. _x000D_
_x000D_
The proposed project emphasizes optical engineering to develop a microscope designed for high-resolution chemical imaging based on molecular vibrational IR-absorptions. This is achieved by deploying focusing elements that operate over a broad spectral range that extend standard optical microscopes to include mid-infrared light sources. The optical instrument will be used to evaluate chemical content in industrial microbe strains and develop enriched cell lines. These single-cell microbe populations are engineered to produce enzymes used to catalyze the synthesis of valuable metabolites. Yields from individual cells, however, are variable due to genetic mutations in the population. Therefore, a quantitative analytical tool based on IR-spectroscopy that can non-destructively identify highly productive cells for selective propagation is extremely desirable. This bottom-up approach for metabolomic cell screening and directed evolution is an innovation as it is label-free, non-invasive, and has strong chemical specificity. In this project, the team will study an industrial microalgae strain used as a low-cost feedstock supplement and identify cells rich in protein content to enhance the overall protein yield._x000D_

The technology addressed by this project may protect surgical implants, such as joint replacements and spinal fusion systems from bacterial colonization and developing infections. This technology could significantly reduce the greater than $3 billion cost to the US healthcare system from implant related infections. This antimicrobial technology could be used beyond medical applications for such things as food packaging to decrease foodborne diseases and more than double shelf-life of certain food products. Additionally, the linker technology developed through this project may be used to create super slick or self-cleaning surfaces with applications in the aerospace and marine industries resulting in increased fuel efficiency and performance._x000D_
_x000D_
The project aims to develop a homogeneous, covalently bound, linker molecule attached to medical implant material (titanium alloy) upon which a quaternary ammonium-modified oligosaccharide will be subsequently attached. Oligosaccharides are known to be biocompatible and quaternized oligosaccharides are highly potent antimicrobials. A treated medical implant could possess a powerfully antimicrobial surface so that, during surgery, any bacteria that encounter the surface will be killed. In this way, it is hoped that the avascular surface of the implant will not serve as a site for biofilm formation and growth and thus, reduce the incidence of perioperative infections. The key to any successful surface modification is the quality of the chemical attachment of linkers and active molecules to that surface. Polyphenols and catechols such as dopamine are ideal candidates for investigation as these molecules are generally known for their facility in forming thin films onto a wide variety of surfaces. Using dopamine as a model system, catechol analogs will be electrochemically attached, and the resulting thin films analyzed for attachment, thickness, ease of further modification, and morphology. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), UV/Visible spectroscopy, soak/stress protocols and microbiology will be used to gauge the success or failure of a thin film plus oligosaccharide combination._x000D_

Deterioration of these natural resources poses downstream risks to ournational and economic security and access to food and water that could materialize as soon as 2060.To mitigate these threats U.S. farmers need technologies that allow them to reduce their applicationof phosphorus fertilizer without compromising crop yield. However there are currently noalternatives to traditional phosphorus fertilizers available on the market.We are developing plant microbiome solutions that will enable as much as a 50% reductionin phosphorus fertilizer use curb phosphorus runoff promote soil fertility and enhance crop yields.Our research entails the discovery and engineering of plant-colonizing microbial strains to facilitateplant phosphorus uptake and measurement of their plant-growth-promoting performance via thelaboratory greenhouse and field studies.

For specialty crop farmers in particular this adds pressure to an industry that facesmultiple challenges that if left unaddressed could jeopardize the viable production of manyvegetable fruit and nut crops in the country. We propose to demonstrate a plant-by-plant precisionfertilization capability for cool season vegetable crops that will increase harvest yields whilereducing the overall amount of fertilizer applied. The solution will help farmers increase marginsin the face of escalating production costs while meeting increasingly stringent environmentalregulations. The overarching objectives of our variable rate application (VRA) approach are todetermine and apply an optimal amount of fertilizer for each plant to adjust for the inherent fieldand seed variations so that most plants meet customer specifications and are sold at harvest. Anadditional benefit of the anticipated capability will be less food waste employing the EPA FoodRecovery Hierarchy's most preferred method of reducing waste where the food is produced.Our innovation includes obtaining a priori information on a field's plant size distribution fromhigh resolution aerial imagery of the entire field. The size distribution will be used to determinean application prescription which will be sent to a mechanical controller on a tractor-mountedsprayer. Over time associated plant growth models will be augmented to account for the effectsof additional fertilizer possibly even accounting for different future varieties that are moredrought tolerant or less fertilizer hungry. We will leverage recent experimental results indicatingthat different fertilizer application amounts lead to different growth rates of iceberg lettuce so thatapplying different amounts to different sized plants will increase field uniformity at harvest andalso reduce total required fertilizer amounts per crop cycle. The proposed effort will validate andextend these preliminary findings to develop a unique capability for vegetable production. DuringPhase I we will determine geolocation accuracy requirements and evaluate if system componentscan meet them. We will assess timing and coordination requirements of aerial imagery collectionprocessing and conversion to a prescription map and we will evaluate spray controllerrequirements and performance for the VRA approach. We will assess the overall technicalfeasibility of the proposed concept and perform a preliminary cost-benefit analysis for VRAcommercialization in the vegetable industry.

The frequency of epilepsy is distributed unevenly, however, with the vast majority of cases occurring in less developed regions of the world. The likely explanation for this distribution is that one third of all epilepsy cases are due to neurocysticercosis, known to be the most common parasitic infection of the nervous system. Neurocysticercosis is caused by the presence of larval cysts of Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm, in the brain, which can cause seizures and illness ranging from mild to fatal depending on their location, number and viability. In contrast to idiopathic epilepsy, a complex disease which can be difficult to treat and resistant to cure, neurocysticercosis can be treated and in many cases cured with inexpensive and available anti-helminthic drugs. Distinguishing whether the cause of seizures is idiopathic epilepsy or neurocysticercosis is thus a critical part of the diagnostic workup and essential to determine the appropriate course of treatment for patients. The established procedures for diagnosing epilepsy comprise electroencephalography and imaging via MRI, but these sophisticated tools are of limited availability in the less developed world where neurocysticercosis is most frequent. On the other hand, neurocysticercosis can be diagnosed with a serological test that detects antibodies to T. solium cysts. The gold standard serological test, the Enzyme Immunotransfer Blot (EITB) developed at CDC, is a laboratory-based test, however, it is not widely available and requires significant training to carry out. Thus there is a critical need for a rapid, commercially available point-of-care test for neurocysticercosis that can be used to test patients with seizures, in order to identify those with the parasitic infection so that they can be treated effectively. Development of such a test has been identified as an urgent priority by the World Health Organization. In the Phase I project, we utilized recombinant and synthetic T. solium antigens corresponding to those used in the EITB to develop a prototype lateral flow, point-of-care serological test for neurocysticercosis aimed at meeting the criteria in the World Health Organization’s Target Product Profile. These antigens have shown high sensitivity and specificity in prior studies, and in combination further increase the sensitivity for detection of single viable cysts, the most challenging disease manifestation. In Phase II, the lateral flow neurocysticercosis test will be evaluated in prospective studies on neurological patients with symptoms suggestive of neurocysticercosis, and in retrospective studies on well-characterized sera from neurocysticercosis patients confirmed by EITB or clinical diagnosis, and for specificity on healthy controls and other disease state sera. Phase II will support complete development to commercial stage, clinical evaluation and preparation for CE mark and FDA submission of the neurocysticercosis point-of-care test.",  ,,,,ANDREW E LEVIN,,6178340950,alevin@kephera.com,,  ,

Guardionrsquo;s proposed solution is to eliminate the need of high voltage electron multipliers utilizing patented 2D material-based ion detectors that provide intrinsic charge to current amplification values ranging between 1E6-1E9 A/C, and only require an operating bias of 0.1V. It further distinguishes between positive and negative ions, and works from atmospheric pressure through ultra high vacuum. Unlike conventional methods of detection used in mass spectrometry, our sensors will exploit a low-bias intrinsic quantum gain mechanism in nanomaterials to amplify the signal from trace amounts of ions. This eliminates the need for external amplification, eliminates high voltage requirements, and significantly reduces power consumption. We have shown that replacing sensors in a commercial residual gas analyzer with these detectors can sense trace gasses. We propose to modify two existing mass filter systems, one residual gas analyzer and one ion trap mass spectrometer with our detector assembly and demonstrate comparable performance to state of the art detectors while using 10,000x less voltage. We will then demonstrate sensor response to mass range, sampling rate, charge state, and ion energy.

The 2013-2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa highlighted the serious nature of a filovirus epidemic and its regional and global implications. This outbreak took an enormous toll on people at the front line of the epidemic control, i.e., physicians, nurses, hospital personnel, social workers, and other support staff. Many nurses and physicians lost their lives helping patients and many left their profession out of fear of exposure. The near breakdown of the local healthcare system further fueled the spread of the virus across the region. Therefore, protection of the first responders must be a high priority and is critical for successful outbreak control. Currently, while a prophylactic vaccine is available for EVD, there are no therapeutic or prophylactic countermeasures available for Marburg virus disease (MVD) which has led to many outbreaks and as recently as June 2022. The objective of this proposal is to develop an effective immunoprophylactic for protection of first responders against MVD. Such a product mut be 1) extremely potent to enable economically affordable low dose levels, and 2) have extended bioavailability to provide a reasonably long duration of protection. We and others have isolated several classes of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for ebolaviruses. However, for marburgviruses only a single class of mAbs against the glycoprotein (GP) has been described that all target a single epitope within the receptor binding site (RBS) of MARV and RAVV GP. Now, using a novel immunization and B cell selection approach with rationally designed antigens we have succeeded in identifying a new class of mAbs that bind to a novel epitope and neutralize marburgviruses at sub- to low-nM concentrations and are up to 100-fold more potent than the RBS binders. A lead antibody, R217, has been selected and shown to protect against MVD in mice, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates (NHPs). In this SBIR project we propose to engineer the Fc portion of this macaque-human chimeric antibody by introducing mutations (YTE) in the FcRn binding region to extend the half-life of the antibody and evaluate the efficacy of the product. In Aim 1 R217-YTE will be produced in ExpiCHO cells and fully characterized. Pharmacokinetics (PK) will be evaluated in NHPs. In Aim 2, the efficacy of R217-YTE against MVD will be evaluated in the settings of pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis and the required dose level and serum neutralization activity required for protection will be determined. Aim 3 will be focused on generation of a stable manufacturing cell line in CHO cells and a research cell bank to be used for production of future GMP cell banks. If successful, we anticipate further development of the product under DoD or BARDA funding and approval under FDA Animal Rule.",  ,,,,M J AMAN,,3015128921,jaman@abvacc.com,,  ,

Macroalgae are already used in smallquantities in some animal diets but the complex polysaccharides are largely indigestible. Trials atOcean Era have shown that the microbes from herbivorous reef fish can be used as the inoculum fordeconstruction of macroalgae for aquaculture feeds. The project objective is to identify microbesthat are key to fermentation of tropical macroalgal species as Partially Digested Macroalgae(PDMA) - a partial dietary replacement for aquaculture feeds. We will test a range of microbialisolates to optimize a reproducible fermentation process for deconstructing macroalgae intonutritionally beneficial feedstuffs.

It is a cognitive network because it is designed to act as a collective to increase overall network effectiveness, not just send information from point to point. Osmosis software downloads to existing equipment, systems and networks, and encapsulates disparate information into an environment that supports any protocol, frequency, or encryption. Osmosis assesses criteria like spectrum, protocol, throughput and connectivity capability of each platform and chooses the best connection path based on those capabilities in concert with all other nodes in the mesh that are within the path to the data recipient. The nodes continually assess the quality of the data paths in order to self-heal and load balance, thereby increasing resiliency and throughput, all within a multi-level security construct. This security schema coupled with the open architecture allows for zero-knowledge parsing and forwarding by classification, affording information sharing across multiple domains and seamless Joint/Coalition integration as well as the utilization of commercial nodes and architecture to enhance coverage, speed and resiliency. Additionally, Osmosis will facilitate each node’s ability to report precise positioning information, even in satellite-denied environments. Osmosis was built from the ground up to coordinate Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) and data fusion in the battle space. This proposed Phase II effort will refine and iterate on the above features as well as further the development of the Osmosis Planner and Manager applications which utilize network logic to display network performance (both expected and real-time). This allows mission planners and operators to manage the self-healing thresholds and priorities of the network during pre-mission, execution, and will provide a replay for post-mission analysis. WTI is a Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business with a forward-thinking team with over 100 years of collective experience building critical military communication networks.

Dr. Scott KohlProject Summary/AbstractRenewable fuels offer an opportunity to offset carbon emissions generated by heavytransportation industries such as trucking and aviation. A major issue hindering the ability forrenewable fuel producers to reach desired production rates is the lack of abundance in usablefeedstocks. Renewable feedstock oils must meet certain criteria on impurities levels beforehydrotreating to protect from destruction of expensive catalyst beds. VFT proposes the use of itsproprietary Fiber Reactor technology protected by a global patent portfolio (including patentsspecific to the desired application) for the efficient and economical valorization of low CI scorewaste fats and oils as feedstocks to produce renewable fuels which does not require centrifuge orbleaching clays. VFT's technology provides 10x surface area of traditional mixing technologiesat a fraction of the size. VFT enables highly efficient immiscible phase mixing with fiber mediainternals to drive mass transfer of molecules from one immiscible phase to the other. Theelimination of chaotic mechanical mixing prevents or significantly minimizes emulsionformation so that the bi-phasic streams exiting the Fiber Reactor are cleanly separated.,  ,,,,Scott  Kohl,,(316) 619-5806,skohl@visionaryfiber.com,,  ,

cost hydro or nuclear electricity or when co-located with large renewable power sources like windfarms and large solar installations.However there are large energy and economic penaltiesassociated with hydrogen liquefaction transport and delivery; especially to remote or largely rurallocations.In contemplating distributed production of hydrogen it makes far more sense to transport thefeedstock to points of production and use.This creates a unique opportunity for ethanol to playan important role in hydrogen production because it is already abundantly available readilyextractable from fermentation of biomass low toxicity and it can achieve carbon neutrality.The ProjectAn essential component to the use of ethanol as a green source of hydrogen is the ability toefficiently and cost effectively convert it to hydrogen in a compact system that can be easilyreplicated in many locales.With that goal in mind this proposal describes the integration of twoenabling technologies: the integration of adiabatic oxidative reformer system and a waterelectrolyzer that in combination eliminate major cost components and greatly simplify theprocess of converting ethanol to hydrogen.In addition to diversifying the ethanol markethydrogen offers ethanol producers an additional value-added option to fuel grade ethanol.The objectives of the project revolve largely around the design engineering the small-scaledemonstration and economic analysis of the combined technologies using 95% ethanol as afeedstock and by-product oxygen from an electrolyzer to produce 99.999% H and a pure stream2
of CO2.To demonstrate the technical and economic viability of the proposed technology the work planconsists of:1.Construction and operation of a reduced-scale adiabatic oxidative reformer to finalize catalystformulations and validation of engineering simulations.2.Design and testing a feedback loop control system to coordinate the integrated operation of theoxidative reformer and electrolyzer.3.Develop cash flow model for hydrogen production from ethanol with simultaneous productionof hydrogen and oxygen from electrolysisThe CustomerRecognizing the limitations of batteries and the shift to reduce emissions Volvo Cummins NewHolland Deere Kubota CNHi and AGCO are rapidly addressing fuel-cell and H -powered2
internal combustion equipment.The reason is because by weight the energy density of hydrogenis superior to all other choices exceeding that of all hydrocarbon options.Hydrogen has almostthree times the energy density as diesel (120 MJ/kg for H versus 45.5 MJ/kg for diesel).2
Value PropositionFor the industry to grow it is essential that hydrogen be economically available and distributedwidely enough to support the growing demand.The United States and Brazil are the world'slargest producers of ethanol.With the potential for decreasing demand of fuel ethanol as EV'sbegin to populate the roads there is an opportunity to capitalize on that decreasing demand andoffer a value-added product.Since ethanol transport delivery handling and storage are largelycompatible with existing infrastructure with the right conversion technology ethanol can be avaluable source of hydrogen for distributed generation (500 - 1500 kg/day) in locations proximalto the point of use.",  ,,,,Jeffrey  Harrison,,(609) 864-9746,jbharrison@pcchydrogen.com,,  ,

Due to these properties they have been used for decades in productssuch as aqueous film-forming foams Teflon waterproof clothing and food packaging. The sameproperties that make them useful also cause them to be difficult to remediate and to bioaccumulatein livestock and humans. Currently there are no PFAS remediation tools for livestock producersbut it is estimated that 57000 sites in the US are contaminated and that the number will grow astesting increases. Contamination comes from many sources including water (surface or ground) andcontaminated biosolids for soil fertilization and have been found in poultry and dairy and beefcattle. To complicate remediation the half-life of many PFASs (6 months or more) often exceed theproduction lifetime of livestock. A practical on-farm PFAS remediation tool to prevent and/or treatPFAS contamination in animal products prior to harvest is to be developed by 1) determining theefficacy of Fluor Mop (FM) sorbent at remediating PFAS in tissues of contaminated laying hens byincorporating the material into feed at different dosages and analyzing the tissues and eggs and 2)determining the efficacy of dietary FM at preventing accumulation of PFAS in the edible tissues ofbroilers by feeding Fluor Mop silica based sorbent. These two objectives will give an idea of thedosage needed for PFAS removal and overall will improve the safety of end products derived fromagriculturally important animals in the preharvest environment.,  ,,,,Alexa  May,,(816) 678-1938,alexa.may@weaver-labs.com,USDA ARS Edward T.

year. Continuous monitoring of these patients is essential and the ability to quickly identify critical changes in a
patients' health status is crucial to guiding daily care and therapy. While individual medical devices are helpful
in this endeavor, integrating information from multiple devices onto one display and performing real-time
analytics on this data enhances identification of the reasons for a change in patient condition and not just that a
condition has changed. Continuously recording and providing both trending and real-time analysis for real
changes in patient status can help optimize care decisions thus improving outcomes in this fragile population.In this grant we will build upon the success of the previously cleared Vital Sync multi-modal monitor that
captures and analyzes information from over 100 devices in the NICU to help make the information actionable.
The new device provides a continuous and retrospective view of patient condition so that care providers can
objectively evaluate the effectiveness of treatment modifications. Real time assistance with identification of
changes in patient condition helps to optimize new neuroprotective protocols. Improved review of prior patient
condition through trending analysis and event marking assists with continuity of care across shift changes. The
Phase I prototype is designed to evaluate the feasibility and usability of the tool in the NICU environment. The
phase 2 system will support additional features including reduced connectivity burden and protocol support.
Centraview 2.0 will be a platform for future modular upgrades that will enhance clinical decision support (CDS)
in any ICU environment.
Phase 1 Aim 1 – Create a prototype multimodal monitor for neonatal neurocritical care
Based on existing experience and technology, we will design and prototype a new generation bedside monitoring
system for collecting and displaying data from the key NICU medical devices at UFHealth.
Phase 1 Aim 2 – Evaluate usability of the new system in a simulated NICU
In a simulated NICU environment, we will create three neonatal patient scenarios and evaluate the system in a
usability study with 8 NICU clinicians including surveys to determine perceived value, usability, and acceptance.
Phase 2 Aim 1 – Expand connectivity, add protocol adherence, and enhance usability
Clinical feedback from a successful Phase 1 will be used to improve the functionality and usability of CentraView
2. HIE protocol support will be added to the system along with several other new features including derived
parameters and wireless data collection.
Phase 2 – Aim 2 – Evaluate the effectiveness of CentraView 2 Clinical Assistant
We will first collect baseline data for 6 months at UFHealth to measure adherence with several clinical practice
guidelines (CPG). Next, we will install and train clinicians on the use of the CentraView system and determine if
the system improves compliance with the CPGs.",  ,,,,TONY C CARNES,,(352) 378-4899,tonyccarnes1@gmail.com,,  ,

POP occurs when the pelvic floor connective tissue and muscles weaken, allowing the uterus or vaginal walls to descend. In extreme cases, the uterus descends through the opening of the vagina and hangs outside of the body. POP can be treated non-surgically with a pessary that is inserted into the vagina and acts as a shelf to support the descending organs. Commonly used pessaries have a fixed and rigid design, making them difficult or impossible for patients to remove and insert independently. Reia has developed an innovative collapsible pessary to reduce pain and discomfort associated with pessary insertion and removal. During Phase II, the pessary successfully passed all FDA required mechanical, microbiological, and biocompatibility tests. Reia has evaluated its pessary in n=50 current pessary users between its early feasibility and feasibility trials. Subjects reported increased comfort during insertion and removal when using Reia’s pessary compared to their current pessaries and their prolapse was effectively supported. During Phase IIB, Reia will (1) prepare and submit a 510(k) clearance application to the FDA. Reia will achieve this aim by professionally manufacturing and testing fitting pessaries, performing packaging, shipping, and distribution testing, and compiling the 510(k) application. Reia will (2) modify and optimize a pessary applicator, which was designed during Phase II to increase access to self-management. To achieve this aim, Reia will professionally manufacture a ß-prototype with medical grade materials, perform benchtop mechanical, biocompatibility, and cleaning validation testing, and assemble a 510(k) application. Reia will (3) conduct a clinical trial comparing success of home-management between Reia’s pessary system (pessary and applicator) and the standard of care in pessary-naïve patients. Defined evaluation criteria have been established to measure progress and success. Reia’s founding team is comprised of a urogynecologist with 25 years of experience fitting pessaries and treating POP and a 3-person, female executive management team with combined experience in product development, operational manufacturing and production practices, and IP advisory. Additionally, an advisory board contributes expertise in urogynecology, commercialization of medical devices, and successful completion of numerous NIH grant funded projects. Reia has strategically aligned with manufacturing facilities, testing laboratories, and regulatory consultants to gain access to necessary equipment, resources, and guidance to successfully complete this project. Reia is committed to optimizing its pessary system for clinical use and manufacture to bring to market the first-ever pessary specifically designed to address women’s needs.",  ,,,,PAUL  HANISSIAN,,6037157017,paul@reiahealth.com,,  ,

FA anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition, increased 200-400% in children from toddlers to teens.10 Peanut/ tree nut and sesame allergy often co-exist, last a lifetime, cause severe reactions, and there is currently no cure. Common treatments, either prophylactic i.e., food avoidance, or therapeutic i.e., food allergen oral immunotherapy are limited and impractical. Safe, effective, and non-food restricted therapeutics are needed. FA is primarily mediated by food protein specific immunoglobulin E. Persistent IgE caused by long-lived plasma cells (IgE+LPC) is a significant barrier to FA mitigation. General Nutraceutical Technology LLC (GNT), a NY-based biotechnology startup, is building on groundbreaking research for FA started at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Our oral product “NIT-X” contains the small molecule compound berberine captured by nanoparticles. It significantly increased bioavailability, showed excellent preclinical safety and nearly 100% reduction of PN-IgE and protection against anaphylaxis in animal model of peanut and tree nut allergies, associated with suppressing IgE+ plasma cells/B cells, reducing IL-4, increasing IFN-γ, inducing a distinct B cell transcriptomic profile. We hypothesize that by restoring balanced immunity. NIT-X will be a potentially novel non-food restricted therapeutic for severe and multiple FAs. The goals of this SBIR Phase II are generating robust NIT-X Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control (CMC), along further preclinical pharmacokinetic (PK), toxicology and pharmacology data, and file the phase Ia clinical study. We will conduct 4 Specific Aims: #1 Generating NIT-X CMC data, characterization of product and preclinical PK profile; #2. Further generation of data on NIT-X preclinical toxicology; #3. Investigate dose efficacy of NIT-X in murine models. #4. File phase Ia clinical trial as a sub-program to an ongoing parent botanical IND. Solid SBIR phase I feasibility data and strong team and design for phase II study enable GNT to generate rigorous date for CMC, preclinical PK, safety, and efficacy for obtaining approval of IND for a subproject to the current IND for clinical trials with NIT-X, towards commercialization for treating FA.",  ,,,,NAN  YANG,,9142287410,nan.yang@gnt-us.com,,  ,

Confirmatory culture-based methods or technologies (e.g.polymerase chain reaction and mass spectrometry) are labor-intensive have long turnaround time(1-5 days) and require expensive instrumentation. This is too slow and expensive for the foodindustry for mass screening. Lateral flow rapid test kits (RTKs) are rapid (15 min runtime)inexpensive user-friendly and the results can be read directly by the naked eye making thempromising for on-site testing methods. However conventional RTKs have inherent sensitivitylimitations due to the reliance on gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) or latex beads as signal labels.We have developed a RTK platform with a built-in enzymatic amplification mechanism forultrasensitive (10-1000 times more sensitive) detection of foodborne pathogens E. coli O157:H7and Salmonella Enteritidis.We have screened and selected antibody pairs for these two RTKs withexcellent detection limit (1000 CFU/mL) and specificity. Herein we will validate the RTKs with alarge panel (> 20 strains each) of reference bacteria materials spiked into relevant food matrices andculture media. We will also conduct accelerated stability test to validate the RTK productionenzyme-antibody conjugation and stability formuation protocols. The sensitivity and specificitydata from this Phase I project can be used towards AOAC certification (to be pursued in a Phase IIproject) which will allow us to commercialize and market the RTKs.,  ,,,,Jun Hui  Soh,,(510) 974-6224,jhsoh@cellbae.com,,  ,

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer in the USA and accounts for more than 600,000
deaths annually worldwide, primarily due to relapse with highly aggressive, chemo-resistant disease
characterized by poorly differentiated cancer cells with stem cell-like properties. A common signature of these
chemo-resistant tumors is dysregulation of Notch receptor signaling, as well as upregulation of its
metalloprotease activator, ADAM10. Although small molecule inhibition of either Notch or ADAM10 has been
shown to produce potent anti-tumor effects, these therapeutic strategies have failed in clinical trials primarily due
to systemic toxicities, especially cytotoxic effects on the gastrointestinal tract and musculoskeletal system,
highlighting the need for development of more targeted approaches. We have previously demonstrated that
ADAM10 predominantly exists in an inhibited state in normal tissues but is activated in tumor cells through a
conformational change in the extracellular domain, thus providing a potential target for tumor-specific modulation
of ADAM10 activity. Here, we look to characterize a novel human monoclonal antibody agent (1H5) that
selectively targets an exposed extracellular region of activated ADAM10 on tumor cells. We previously
demonstrated that treatment with a murine version of the antibody (8C7), specific for the activated form of both
mouse and human ADAM10, conferred a significant reduction in tumor burden against human CRC cell lines in
cell culture and transplants in xenograft models, and relapse was prevented when 8C7 was combined with
chemotherapy. The goal of this proposal will be perform in-depth preclinical “go/no-go” experimentation that will
provide a definitive evaluation of ADAM10 monoclonal antibodies as a therapeutic approach. Here, we look to
investigate our murine and human mAb agents at the molecular, cellular, and physiological levels by
biochemically, characterizing their mechanism of action through in vivo assessment of metastatic CRC lesions
in syngeneic immune-competent mouse models (8C7) and through xenograft models using human tumors (1H5).
We hypothesize that through the use of genetic tools combined with in vitro and in vivo models, we can gain
important information that significantly de-risks the clinical development of 1H5-based therapeutic agents as we
move forward clinical trials to treat a broad population of CRC patients. Our research will not only help us move
1H5 toward successful clinical trials, it will also pioneer a new standard to comprehensively study novel
therapeutic agents and identify potential failures early on. The overall goal of this proposal is to fully characterize
a unique therapeutic agent to selectively impair Notch pathway activation in models of CRC to produce potent
but less toxic therapies, advancing only candidates with a greater chance of success through clinical trials.",  ,,,,PREM K PREMSRIRUT,,(929) 377-3744,prem@mirimus.com,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,  ,

However, new laws are currently being, or are planned to be, implemented in California, the United States, and the European Union to ban the use of animals for ocular irritation testing. Despite this fact, there is currently no single nonanimal test or combination of nonanimal tests that can accurately classify all levels of ocular irritants and corrosives. It is of particular concern that all nonanimal tests generally overpredict the least damaging class of ocular irritants and cannot determine (or determine with low sensitivity) the most extreme class for which they have sensitivity rates as low as 50%. More importantly, none of the currently validated alternative tests can detect irritants that require proper safety labeling (GHS Cat. 2A) or those that cause irritation that lasts up to 21 days but then clears without causing permanent corneal damage. This target classification represents a critical UNMET NEED for correctly informing and advising consumers and manufacturers about product safety. We have recently developed and tested a new method, the in vitro depth of injury eye irritation test (IVD EIT), to detect all classes of irritants with high sensitivity and specificity. The purpose of this application is to further develop the IVD EIT with the long-term goal of providing a service and/or kit for the accurate classification of ocular irritants to meet this UNMET NEED for a nonanimal ocular irritation test to be used to label product and chemicals and hence ensure safe handling practices. 1",  ,,,,STEWART  LEBRUN,,9492460339,stewart@lebrunlabs.com,,  ,

Amelioration of miniature embedded computing devices into the consumer and industrial markets with enabled connectivity to the Internet towards smart and intelligent features leads to an upsurge in the size of networks through which they are linked and communicate. Unfortunately, with the massive amount of potential benefits offered by IoT devices comes an equal amount of potential vulnerabilities and cyber-threats including such as Malware, ransomware, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Detection and defense of cyber-threats in IoT devices are traditionally performed by anti-virus (AV) software. However, AV-based threat detection has significant setbacks including large latency, processing overheads, inability to effectively detect zero-day attacks, and requirement of frequent updates. In this project, we propose the design of hardware-assisted runtime cyber-threat detection. We employ hardware-generated microarchitectural event traces captured through hardware performance counter (HPC) register information to extract the application characteristics to detect cyber-threats. To minimize overheads and facilitate runtime feasibility, an automated learning-based optimal feature extraction is designed. These features are fed to a lightweight machine learning (ML) classifier to detect the feasibility of the presence of cyber-threat. This is complemented with a specialized ML classifier in the second stage for enhanced performance. The second stage ML classifier also employs a time-series-based anomaly detection for zero-day and unseen threat detection.

The ability to freely move assets within, into, and out of the nation is paramount to national security. While DHS currently employs highly-effective explosive alarm resolution sensors (AR), these sensors require special training to operate and produce a tremendous cognitive load on the user.
Explosive devices come in various shapes, sizes, and concealment. Therefore, the proposed work will use machine learning to create a sensor suite and associated algorithms for threat detection and classification as a function of these variations. Specifically, this proposal will create a framework for using simulation-based transfer learning to create &quot;context-aware&quot; AR sensor suites. The framework will use a low-fidelity simulation environment to simulate output data for notional AR sensors. These data can be used to fully explore the performance of potential AR sensor integrations across explosive variations. These sensor suites could include integrations for combining visual and IR camera outputs to detect glass or combining thermal and LIDAR geometry data to detect fingerprints. This simulation framework will also provide a training ground for context-aware algorithms. Transfer learning techniques will be developed for training algorithms in simulation and then transferring these algorithms to real-world sensor outputs.

It spreads easily between hospitalized patients and nursing home residents. C. auris is especially hazardous to immunosuppressed patients and those hospitalized with Covid‐19. Particularly concerning, some strains of C. auris are resistant to all three major classes of antifungal drugs. As a result, this deadly pathogen has been classified as an Urgent Threat by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and new antifungal drugs are desperately needed.  Most antifungal drugs are derived from natural compounds produced by environmental microorganisms. However, screening for antifungals from this source has fallen into disfavor, as the readily culturable microorganisms have been overmined. However, 99% of environmental microorganisms have never been screened because they will not grow under normal laboratory conditions. To address this problem, we used our iChip culturing technology to assemble a large collection of previously uncultured microorganisms. The iChip enables microorganisms to grow in their natural environment (e.g., soils), giving them access to essential growth factors. As a result, we screen microorganisms that are inaccessible to other drug discovery programs. We have used the iChip technology to discover several new antibacterial compounds such as teixobactin, which is currently in IND-enabling studies to treat drug-resistant bacterial infections. In this project we will screen our unique microbe collection for compounds that kill C. auris.  In preliminary studies, we screened a small number of our iChip isolates (3,000) against C. auris. From this limited screening, we have already found five potentially novel antifungals, which we will pursue in this project. In addition, we will screen a much larger number of our isolates (30,000) to obtain additional promising compounds. Crude extracts will first be produced from fermentations and screened against C. auris. The compounds producing the antifungal activity will then be isolated from the extracts to determine their chemical novelty, potency against other important fungi (including drug-resistant strains), cytotoxicity, and frequency of resistance. Promising compounds will then be tested in a mouse efficacy model of fungal infection (disseminated candidiasis). Compounds that show good animal efficacy will be considered lead compounds and their full chemical structure will be elucidated. Our goal at the end of this project is to discover 1-2 novel lead compounds for preclinical development to combat C. auris and potentially other fungal infections.",  ,,,,AMY L SPOERING,,6178642880,aspoering@novobiotic.com,,  ,

FaRROE enables the transfer of regolith from excavators to within a lunar oxygen extraction reactor, and the transfer of processed regolith from the reduction reactor to a holding hopper or the lunar surface. The system incorporates noncontact temperature measurements of the regolith within the reactor using a 2-color pyrometer to monitor regolith phase change and temperatures up to and exceeding 2,000 C. The innovative design of the FaRROE system incorporates non-mechanical valves at the reactor inlet and outlet to enable the continuous feed of regolith into and out of an enclosed reactor at high processing rates (gt;25 kg/hr) with no moving parts coming into contact with the regolith. Sealing of the reactor inlet is produced through a vertical tube hopper packed with unprocessed regolith, creating a tortuous path for product gases and preventing their escape from the reactor chamber. An extrusion nozzle at the reactor outlet enables the controlled removal of processed regolith and formation of a liquid seal preventing the escape of product gases. Utilizing unprocessed and processed regolith as the sealing mechanisms reduces mass, complexity, and likelihood of mechanical failure of the system. The extraction of oxygen is monitored through two redundant systems to measure oxygen production rate, system efficiency, and leak rate. Mineral-oxide content is measured continuously at the unprocessed inlet feed and processed outlet feed. The oxygen and/or other product gases generated within the reactor are monitored through in-line gas analysis. FaRROE may be integrated with every known high-temperature oxygen extraction method for regolith to enable continuous processing at high feed rates through a lightweight, durable design to ensure long-term continuous operation in the harsh lunar environment",NASA SBIR  Support Office,,(301) 937-0888,sbir@reisystems.com,Andrew  Brewer,,(303) 953-0297,abrewer@outward.tech,,  ,

Unfortunately, although efficacious in some patients, current immunotherapies, e.g., rituximab, belimumab, leave the plasma cell factories of offending autoantibodies untouched. Furthermore, these therapies are predicated on B-cell depletion, which is problematic from a safety standpoint. B cells are critical for generation of protective immunity against newly emergent infections such as COVID-19 and Monkey Pox, and, for those unvaccinated, Polio. We live is a world where pandemics caused by newly emerged pathogens is increasingly becoming the norm. It is incumbent upon us to develop therapeutic strategies that do not render patient immunity permanently compromised.  We have developed an alternative, non-cell-depleting and reversible approach to B cell silencing involving the targeting of CD79a, the transducer subunit of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR). The effects of CD79a- targeted mAbs do not require Fc region effector functions; rather, the mAbs act as inverse agonists by stimulating inhibitory signaling circuitry that suppresses BCR responses to antigen. Importantly, treatment with anti-79a antibodies that lack Fc effector function also silences antibody production by plasmablasts and plasma cells suggesting a novel, well-differentiated and lower risk approach for therapy of SLE and other auto-inflammatory conditions. Furthermore CD79a is expressed only in B cells, eliminating risk of off-target effects. In the murine MRL/lpr model of SLE, anti-CD79 antibodies effectively decreased inflammation and improved animal survival, and in a collagen-induced arthritis model of rheumatoid arthritis a single injection of antibody prevented the onset of arthritis and decreased arthritis scores until antibody levels had waned.  We have generated, humanized and affinity matured a monoclonal anti-human CD79a antibody, and demonstrated that in an ADCC and C’ fixation incompetent formulation it is able to prevent development of autoimmunity by induction of a transient and reversible state of polyclonal B cell anergy. Aided by transgenic knock-in mice in which murine extracellular domains of CD79a or b, or both, have been replaced with human counterparts, we now seek in AIM 1 to further define the spectrum of B cells whose activity is targeted by the antibody, and to prolong antibody T1/2 in order to allow less frequent treatment. In AIM 2 we will determine the ability of antibody to cure disease in the pristane-induced SLE model using our human CD79 knock-in mice. In AIM 3 will extend these results to a huSCID model of SLE.  We expect our anti-CD79a antibody to provide a best-in-class immunomodulatory therapeutic with a significantly greater safety and efficacy profile than existing B cell-depleting therapies.

Through our ongoing NCATS SBIR Phase II, Lena Biosciences (LB) developed and commercialized an organ- on-a-chip-like, Perfused Organ Panel, with a proprietary liquid breathing technology that provides uniform interstitial perfusion, superior delivery of oxygen and stable pH to 48 statistically independent organ cultures. In this project, Lena Biosciences will use the Perfused Organ Panel to develop physiologically-relevant in vitro screening systems using cells derived from animal species typically utilized for toxicological testing. Next, LB will replicate biological interactions and toxicological responses observed in animal tissues. Lastly, LB will produce assay data that is suitable for comparisons between in vitro and in vivo animal toxicology studies, and Tox21 HTS data. Ultimately, this project will provide thoroughly characterized and validated, alternative in vitro test systems with high specificity and sensitivity to reduce or replace the use of animals in toxicity testing. In Phase I, LB will develop biologically and xenobiotic-metabolically competent rodent liver and brain models having in vivo like cellular respiratory metabolism to achieve optimal mitochondrial responsiveness and susceptibility to toxicants. The liver model will provide high activity of drug metabolizing enzymes for in situ generation of reactive metabolites, and mimic parallel processes of parent drug deletion and metabolite formation to better model and predict toxicological outcomes. The brain model(s) will mimic the brain’s innate immunity with robust toxicological responses to drug overdose, Acetylcholinesterase inhibition with acute neurotoxicity (Phase I), and neuropathy target esterase inhibition that cause delayed neuropathy (Phase II) following the exposure to organophosphorus (OP) chemicals and their toxic metabolites. Perfused Organ Panel and 3 sets of in vitro controls will be treated with Acetaminophen (APAP) and Malathion, an OP insecticide with a neurotoxic metabolite, Malaoxon, that are relevant to the testing of specific tissue models and for which species-matched in vivo data already exists. This will facilitate benchmarking and show the Perfused Organ Panel’s utility as an alternative to in vivo models currently used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. To successfully carry out these studies and ensure the project’s success, we assembled a team of experts in advanced cell culture models of liver and brain (LB’s PI and CSO, Dr. Shoemaker), drug metabolism and metabolite formation (Dr. Morgan, Emory, Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology), APAP toxicity (Dr. Jaeschke, University of Kansas Medical Center), and brain and liver toxicology (Dr. Caudle, Emory, Department of Environmental Health, Dr. Jaeschke, and Dr. Morgan).",  ,,,,JELENA  VUKASINOVIC,,4043752030,jvukasinovic@lenabio.com,,  ,

Simulation will be accomplished using state of the art model-based systems engineering tools derived from prior DARPA programs (Adaptive Vehicle Make) to automate exploit search.  Commercial RF simulation tools will be used to find mechanisms for energy to enter and exit a target, use resonant cavities to amplify signals, and inherent nonlinearities to modulate a signal of interest into an advantageous RF representation. Automation will both create the input models for the RF simulators and interpret results to extract side channel candidates. Automated physical measurements, implemented in the SideLOCK system developed in task 2, will automatically position, stimulate, and receive precise RF waveforms.  Runtime capabilities will enable a physical, frequency, and modulation search to both validate the simulation results and tune the attack to counter model and simulation uncertainties.  SideLOCK will collect the necessary raw data to enable characterization of modes and hardware subsystems executing on the target. Tools will apply a set of preprocessing algorithms to create feature sets for compact representation, maximum discernibility, and reduction of workload on the discriminator phase.  Automation will help to match algorithm to signal for best performance. AI techniques will be used to discriminate between operating modes on the target.  Facilities will help to select the neural network architecture and hyperparameters that permit mode discrimination.  Workflow engines will automate the training, using SideLOCK acquired, feature-extracted data.

Recently, the Navy has developed new technical paradigms to solve the many challenges associated with UAV operations from ships other than aircraft carriers, including launch and recovery of Group 3 through 5 UAVs subject to strong winds and high sea-states. Large fixed wing UAVs operating from ships offer tremendous potential to the Navy to provide Intelligence/Surveillance/Reconnaissance (ISR), increased lethality, ship self-defense, and æloyal wingmanÆ support for manned aircraft. Ā Diversified Technologies Inc. (DTI) proposes to develop a launch and recovery system for GroupĀ to Group 5 UAVs. This system consists of a stowable sponson assembly mounted outside the hull of large ships such as ESB-class vessels. The sponsons consists of rigid lattice frames of stowable outriggers bearing support cables that, in turn, support and guide a carriage to launch or recover the UAV with or without landing gear. The sponsons can be folded upward, downward, or forward for storage. The carriage is controlled by a drive cable that connects to motors that both accelerate and decelerate the system. The motors are located below deck and operated by closed-loop controls. The power system supplies or absorbs the required aircraft energy for launch and recovery, respectively. The system is bidirectional and can launch and recover UAVs approaching from either the bow or the stern of the ship. An articulating arm rapidly loads and unloads the UAVs. The DTI launch and recovery system requires minimal modifications to the UAVs. Many system components are available commercially-off-the-shelf reducing costs and easing supply chain worries. The entire system can also be built as a compact and portable ground-based system. Minimal site preparation is needed, all that is needed is a reasonably flat site. The sponson / outriggers would be replaced by a support frame at each end secured on temporary foundations by ground anchors. The machinery would be located on a skid that can either be truck / trailer mounted or ground anchored on a temporary foundation. The cable based system does not need precise alignment of the mechanical components further simplifying the installation.

In
the United States, cases of C. difficile infection (CDI) are estimated to number 500,000 annually and to result in
an estimated 15,000 to 30,000 deaths. The cost of these cases is thought to exceed $4.8 billion annually.
CDI continues to cause discomfort, serious illness and sometimes death despite several available lines of
treatment. Current treatments include antibiotics, fecal transplant, and an antibody. The antibody represents
a new approach to treating CDI by neutralizing toxins secreted by C. difficile rather than killing the bacteria or
stopping their growth. One limitation of the antibody is that it needs to be delivered via an injection instead of
taken by mouth.
The long-term objective of the proposed research is to develop a new treatment that binds to and neutralize
the toxins made by C. difficile and that may be taken by mouth. The treatment is based on a novel nanoCLAMP
protein similar to antibodies in its structure and potential to neutralize C. difficile toxin. However, compared
with antibodies, nanoCLAMPs are much more resistant to the destructive effect of digestive enzymes.
Resistance to digestive enzymes may enable patients to take this medicine orally and avoid a painful injection.
The objectives of the current proposal are to
1. Select lead anti-TcdB nanoCLAMPs with TcdB-neutralizing activity and developable biophysical
properties.
2. Assess dose-exposure relationship for anti-TcdB nanoCLAMPs in enteric capsules.
3. Evaluate efficacy in acute and recurrence mouse models of C. difficile infection.",  ,,,,RICHARD J SUDERMAN,,(706) 372-3335,rjs@nectagen.com,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,  ,

SRI performs advanced research projects for U.S. government agencies including DARPA, the U.S. military services including the Department of Air Force (DAF), IARPA and the NSF. ???????Confidencial protects documents and the information within them, offering document creators and owners the ability to control data—even when it has been shared with others or accidentally spilled or compromised. Our technology protects words in a sentence, cells in a spreadsheet, or even groups of pixels within an image. This auditable tool greatly simplifies data sharing in high-compliance environments (like the financial and health care sectors) and high-stakes pursuits (like national security and defense) when using widely-used software suites. Confidencial combines techniques to both control and speed up information shared between the DOD, DAF, and allies and partners. The DAF cannot adapt commercial technology to its needs for SecAF Operational Imperatives—all of them—without protecting communications and data containing Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). Confidencial permits protection of CUI between academia, industry, and the DAF. DAF and DOD sponsor research projects which form the technical, quantitative, and qualitative overmatch the DAF wants over all adversaries. However, those projects often generate, share, and communicate CUI data and even classified data—making this a potential vulnerability of interest to DAF and DOD adversaries for targeting, collection, and exploitation. Confidential counts 12 pilot projects with over 400 users as of February 2023. Confidencial has pilots with financial institutions and pharmaceutical companies in the U.S., Japan, and Australia. We anticipate additional pilots with U.S. aerospace firms, additional financial and pharmaceutical institutions in Q2 of CY23. Confidencial integrates into software suites with wide adoption—including Microsoft Office (incl. Teams), PDF, Google Suite, Slack, Salesforce as well as data stored in AWS and Microsoft Azure.

In this Phase I SBIR application, we propose to develop an intranasal, parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5)-based human
metapneumovirus (HMPV) vaccine. HMPV is one of the leading causes of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in
children, immunocompromised individuals, and the elderly. Illness ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe
bronchiolitis and pneumonia, with 90-100% of children infected between the ages of 5-10 years old. No licensed
HMPV vaccine is available and there is an unmet medical need to develop a safe and effective HMPV vaccine.
PIV5 is a safe delivery vector for intranasal immunization. The PIV5-vectored COVID-19 vaccine (CVXGA1) and
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and elderly) vaccine
are currently in Phase 1 clinical testing. Preclinical data for PIV5-based RSV candidate vaccines have shown
excellent immunogenicity, protection, and safety profiles in various animal models, including the cotton rat model,
demonstrating lack of vaccine-induced enhanced disease observed following formalin-inactivated RSV
vaccination. In this grant proposal, we will produce two PIV5-based HMPV candidate vaccine constructs, one in
the W3A strain with the SH gene deleted (W3A!SH-HMPV-F) and another in the canine parainfluenza virus
(CPI) vaccine strain (CPI-HMPV-F) to compare their replication in vitro, antigen expression in vitro,
immunogenicity, and protection against HMPV challenge infection in a mouse model. The novelty of the vaccine
proposed in this Phase I SBIR application relates to: 1) the use of a chimeric HMPV F protein containing the
PIV5 F cytoplasmic tail to potentially increase HMPV F antigen exposure on the virion surface 2) a needle-free
intranasal delivery method in a safe, highly immunogenic viral vector and 3) the ability to induce mucosal
immunity, which is necessary for protecting against respiratory pathogens. Once the PIV5-vectored HMPV
vaccine is demonstrated to be immunogenic in the mouse model, the Phase II SBIR proposal will focus on
preclinical studies needed for entering Phase 1 clinical trials with the final goal of generating a bivalent PIV5-
vectored RSV and HMPV vaccine which would provide protection against the two leading causes of lower
respiratory tract infections in infants and elderly.",  ,,,,MARIA C GINGERICH,,(706) 410-6147,mchd@cyanvacllc.com,,  ,

Current strategies for developing neutralizing Abs are not effective and typically involve screening IgGs from
recovered patients. Pandemic viruses evolve for mutations that can shield their epitopes from host immune
surveillance system, so a lot of important epitopes will be missed. Even after neutralizing Abs isolated are
from human sample, they still need further characterization using epitope binning and determination of
specificities to avoid off target effect. A systematic method for exploring the entire protein surface of a virus
that can identify all potential sites on the virus which can affect its life cycle would have significant impact and
is needed. We propose a structure-guided systematic Ab development pipeline to discover Abs that
can fight infectious diseases. We propose using our novel site-directed Ab development technology,
‘EpiVolve’ (short for Epitope Evolution). EpiVolve will be used to develop site-specific Abs to solvent-exposed
residues and the adjacent ‘context’ sequences. These Abs will be used for fighting infectious disease. The
advantages of EpiVolve are a) overcoming immune tolerance and targeting virus’ human proteome-mimicking
epitopes, b) precisely targeting any antigenic epitopes regardless of its immunogenicity, c) taking advantage
of B cell expansion and somatic hypermutation to generate IgG clonotypes against one targeted residue,
which allows an ability to generate both pan-variants Abs and polymorphism-specific Abs, and d) an ability
for generating a neutralizing Ab discovery pipeline. We will model this on SARS-cov-2 virus in Phase I and
Influenza A in Phase II. EpiVolve developed site-specific antibodies will target solvent-exposed residues on
the protein surface. Structure-guided Ag design will empower the EpiVolve technology in this systematic
analysis. For this proposal, we will present the current preliminary data on the pilot EpiVolve study on SARS-
cov-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), focused mainly on the host cell receptor ACE2 binding interface. For
Phase I studies, we propose to complete the pilot study and extend the study to the whole protein surface of
the RBD domain. Characterizing each Ab by its binding affinity and ability to neutralize SARS-cov-2 virus will
be included in Phase I studies. For Phase II, we propose to apply the learnings from this Phase I study on
another virus model of great importance, the Influenza A virus. Specifically targeting the solvent-accessible
residues of the conserved Stem/Stalk region of the Hemagglutinin (HA) protein",  ,,,,XIAOFENG  LI,,(203) 859-4472,xli@abbratech.com,,  ,

Early intervention is key to reducing mortality and morbidity, yet early diagnosis, particularly for those with asymptomatic disease, is challenging. Effective diagnosis and management of HF and accompanying pulmonary hypertension (PH) requires accurate measurement of four hemodynamic parameters, including ejection fraction (EF), cardiac output (CO), pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). Currently obtained by a combination of echocardiography and cardiac catheterization these assessments can only be performed by skilled medical personnel with specialized training. In addition, cardiac catheterization is highly invasive, requires significant expensive resources, and is associated with risks to the patient. There is an unmet need for an accurate, non-invasive, low cost hemodynamic measurement tool that can be operated without specialized training with accuracy equivalent to cardiac catheterization and sonography. Such a device would enable earlier, safer, and more affordable diagnosis, improved surveillance capabilities, more frequent monitoring of at-risk patients, and better clinical decision support for clinicians in guiding therapies. Non-invasive alternatives to catheterization are not currently available, and there are no technologies that currently exist for simultaneous measurement of EF, CO, PAP and PCWP. Sensydia Corporation is developing a low cost, non-invasive “Cardiac Performance System” (CPS) for hemodynamic measurement with the goal of achieving comparable accuracy to that of gold-standard techniques. CPS acquires and automatically analyzes acoustic and electrocardiogram signals from a set of easily applied sensors to accurately measure EF, CO, PAP, and PCWP. Sensydia has developed fully functioning hardware and prototype software for CPS that uses proprietary algorithms to analyze the acquired signals. Sensydia has been granted 510(k) clearance for measurement of EF; however, further algorithm development and testing are required to achieve a system that can also measure CO, PAP, and PCWP with similar accuracies. In Phase I of this Fast- Track STTR project, PAP and PCWP algorithms will be further refined and tested to meet desired thresholds of accuracy for clinical use using an existing training dataset of CPS and catheterization data obtained by the Sensydia/University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) team and will be assessed based on Bland-Altman bias and limits of agreement. In collaboration with a team of experienced cardiologists and anesthesiologists at UPMC, the CO, PAP and PCWP algorithms will then be prospectively validated in a new, independent dataset from patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Phase II will focus on demonstrating clinical utility and feasibility of routine use in a preoperative clinic setting. Finally, an integrated software application for reporting CPS data and diagnosis based on AHA/ACC guidelines will be developed and assessed in a useability study with UPMC physicians.",  ,,,,AMAN  MAHAJAN,,(310) 966-7840,amahajan@pitt.edu,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH HEALTH SYSTEM,  ,

The goal of this project to develop a sustainable cricket feed using locally sourced pre-consumer
waste streams that costs less than commercially available cricket feed.Ultimately the goal is to
reduce the wholesale price of cricket powder to be price competitive with conventional proteins.
Measures of this project's success include a feed conversion ratio of 1.5:1 and cost per lb of cricket
feed less than $.64/lb at 3125 lb/wk production volume.To meet the cost goal this Project Director
will focus on securing shelf-stable waste within a 30 mile radius of the farm.Byproducts will not be
considered unless a key nutrient cannot be found in a waste stream.
Reducing the price of cricket powder will have a dramatic impact on the demand for the product.
Foodservice and pet food companies have already expressed interest in the product at a lower cost.
As demand increases this creates revenue opportunities for urban farmers who can raise crickets on
vacant lots in abandoned buildings and on rooftops.Even small rural farmers with limited arable
land can benefit from this market.
This furthers the program's goals to develop new smallscale agricultural enterprises focused on
specialty farm products help small to mid-sized farms improve operations through resource
efficiency promote conservation in farming operations explore ways to make urban farming more

At present, nuclear material identification requires samples to be collected and sent to laboratories for analysis using large and expensive equipment, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers (ICP-MS) or secondary-ion mass spectrometers (SIMS). This can take weeks, if not months, to obtain results, and utmost care must be taken to ensure the integrity of the sample. Optical techniques, such as laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and tunable diode laser absorption (TDLAS), show potential as a viable field detector for nuclear materials. However, field LIBS instruments suffer from poor spectral resolution to detect isotopic shifts of nuclear materials while TDLAS instruments lack broad spectral coverage for multi-species detection.  To overcome these limitations, we propose a laser-ablation dual comb spectrometer (LA-DCS) that can provide both broad spectral coverage and high spectral resolution in a compact form factor. Feasibility was demonstrated by characterizing the analytical performance of the measurement using surrogate materials in Phase I, along with specifically looking at the engineering requirements to reduce the size, weight and power (SWaP) of the current Er-fiber DCS into a portable system. We have shown that we could identify the ground state hyperfine splittings in rubidium, a nuclear material surrogate, following a single laser shot. Multiple species identification can be performed with this technology, making it highly suitable for particulate analysis in nuclear forensics.",Daniel N Mannis,TPOC,(571) 616-6208,Daniel.N.Mannis.civ@mail.mil,Jeremy  Yeak,,(505) 363-8012,jeremy@opticslah.com,College of Optical Sciences - University of Arizona,R.

It was estimated that in 2019 there were 4.95 million deaths associated with AMR and 1.27 million deaths directly attributable to AMR. In high income countries, Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent pathogen, accounting for 26.1% of the deaths attributable to AMR. Two of the most prevalent and/or difficult-to-treat pathogens include methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE); both are on the list of WHO and CDC priority pathogens which informs the vital need for new and effective antibiotics. Unfortunately, these pathogens continue to develop new multi-drug resistance patterns reducing therapeutic options. Furthermore, the COVID- 19 pandemic has significantly increased the rates of antimicrobial resistance, and novel therapeutics will be needed in the future to combat these serious and prevalent hospital acquired infections. AimMax Therapeutics has discovered a novel antibiotic, AMX-2005, with broad spectrum and best-in-class activity against MRSA and VRE with potency superior to linezolid and no cross-resistance to vancomycin. This antibiotic has demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity in in vitro time-kill assays at concentrations as low as 2X the MIC as well as bactericidal efficacy in the in vivo murine neutropenic thigh infection model. AMX-2005 shows the potential to be a next generation therapeutic from a class with an established history of clinical safety and low rates of resistance. Collectively, these data provide a strong foundation of support for this proposal. The overall goal of this proposed Phase 1 SBIR application is to develop a novel intravenous formulation of AMX-2005 and generate proof-of-concept data to support the development of a therapeutic for difficult-to-treat indications with high unmet needs. In Aim 1, we will conduct further in vitro microbiology studies to investigate activity and attributes essential to successful therapeutics for serious infections, including an evaluation of the potential for resistance development. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel IV formulation of AMX-2005 through the use of innovative modern excipients and formulation technology. Our top two formulations will then undergo rigorous safety assessments including in vitro compatibility tests with plasma and blood, vein irritation study at the injection site to ensure safety and tolerability of the lead IV formulation, followed by determination of maximum tolerated dose in mice. The PK profiles of the top formulation will be assessed to determine the most suitable dosing regimens for efficacy studies in Aim 3, where we will assess the activity and potency of formulated IV AMX-2005 in mice models of septicemia and thigh infection against MDR strains of MRSA or VRE. Finally, we will conduct a mouse PK study to assess tissue concentrations of AMX-2005. If successful, these data will inform indication selection and a target product profile to support a subsequent Phase 2 SBIR application in which both IV and oral dosage forms of AMX-2005 will be developed.",  ,,,,KARA S KEEDY,,9199235691,kara.keedy@aimmaxrx.com,,  ,

Sepsis is a life-threatening clinical condition which results from a dysregulation of host immune
responses to infection, which leads to multi-organ failure. Sepsis occurs in ~1.7 million US adults
annually resulting in hospitalization and 270,000 deaths. Of those that survive, nearly 50% of
sepsis patients are re-hospitalized and one in six of survivors do not survive past one year. Sepsis
is characterized by increased bacteremia resulting in hyper-systemic inflammatory responses and
a failure to normalize immune homeostasis resulting in septic shock5. Treatment consists of
antibiotics to target bacterial infections and supportive care for targeted organs. However, no
drugs are currently available to target and treat the hyper immune response, indicating that there
is critical unmet need for progressive sepsis therapies. Orai1 is a plasma membrane Ca2+ channel
that regulates store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), a fundamental process. Orai1/SOCE is proximal
in inflammatory signaling and regulates NF-κB-mediated transcription and secretion of pro-
inflammatory responses. Short Palate LUng and Nasal epithelial Clone 1 (SPLUNC1) is a
secreted innate defense protein. We found that SPLUNC1’s C-terminal α6 region is a specific
inhibitor of Orai1. Thus, SPLUNC1/α6 negatively regulates Orai1 to reduce SOCE and
inflammation. Eldec therefore plans to inhibit Orai1 using α6 peptidomimetics to inhibit
inflammation during sepsis. Eldec has successfully developed ELD607, a SPLUNC1
peptidomimetic that is fully size- optimized, and significantly more potent and more proteolytically
stable than SPLUNC1 α6. We have found that ELD607 significantly reduces Orai1/SOCE and
subsequent inflammatory responses associated with sepsis and/or bacterial pneumonia. Our
preliminary data demonstrate that ELD607 reduces sepsis caused by S. aureus and P.
aeruginosa in murine pneumonia models. Additionally, mice treated with ELD607 had increased
survival, suggesting that ELD607 is not immunosuppressive. Our data also indicate that ELD607
reduced blood neutrophilia and improved weight in an LPS-induced sepsis model. Thus, our
studies demonstrate that ELD607 is a novel immunomodulator that is effective against sepsis.
We acknowledge the limitations of murine sepsis models. Thus, to better translate our findings,
we will evaluate ELD607 as a treatment for LPS-induced sepsis in human sepsis patient immune
cells and in nonhuman primates. We will first evaluate the stability of ELD607 human serum from
sepsis patients. We will then evaluate ELD607’s efficacy in human blood neutrophils of sepsis
patients. We will then validate ELD607’s efficacy in nonhuman primates in an LPS-induced sepsis
in order to study the impact of ELD607 on reducing sepsis disease progress.",  ,,,,SAIRA  AHMAD,,(919) 966-1072,sahmad@eldecpharmaceuticals.com,,  ,

A lack of access to broadband has seriousnegative consequences for rural health and digital inclusivity.Tiami LLC's solution for the rural broadband gap is a repeater coordination method that translates5G mobile network frequencies to TV White Space and effectively doubles TVWS transmissionrange in a cost-effective manner.Tiami's first innovation is to coordinate two geographically separated and compact TVWS devicesto achieve the equivalent range of a much larger multi-antenna system without having to deploy agigantic monolithic device. Tiami's second innovation is to leverage existing 5G networks forbackhaul thereby eliminating the cost of building an entire network from scratch that caters to onlyrural users. The efforts in the Phase I period to design and evaluate the performance of CREWS andits effectiveness in rural propagation channels are critical for progressing to Phase II.

For Phase II of this SBIR effort, we propose to use the prototype developed during Phase I as the foundation for this innovation, addressing current MDA needs in object monitoring, surveillance, and intelligence while also incrementally progressing the Department of Defense's experiments in applying machine learning to multi-sensor integration, digital engineering, model and simulation, and big data. During Phase I, ATA tested the feasibility of a platform for developing, deploying, monitoring, and maintaining ML-integrated streaming data pipelines for use in real-time object tracking and analysis. The prototype demonstrated the feasibility of a system that simplifies the historically time-consuming, manual, and code-heavy tasks associated with operational use of ML and streaming data management with innovations that 1) support the ingestion of multiple streaming data sources into the platform using a flexible model to quickly onboard additional new data sources, 2) utilize low-code configuration of ML-integrated streaming data pipelines for simpler streaming data pipeline development and deployment, 3) leverage automation and other operations-related services to support the development, testing, and deployment of ML models, 4) monitor deployed ML models to account for degrading model performance, data drift, and unexpected data, and 5) generate synthetic data to simulate detection events and publish the event data into the system for platform testing and training.

Currently used GS20 scintillator works but the single crystal diffractometer cannot achieve the desired resolution due to low brightness of GS20. We will address the current limitations by using an advanced scintillator, made in a large area, microcolumnar film format that heretofore was not possible to grow because of the extreme hygroscopicity of the material, which emits a relatively low number of photons/MeV gamma but has a reported yield of ~100,000 photons per thermal neutron interaction, a factor ~20 higher yield than current GS20 glass. The high thermal neutron efficiency of this material implies that only ~1.0 mm of scintillator thickness is needed to absorb about 60% of 1&#197; neutrons. The Phase I &amp; II research successfully demonstrated the feasibility of fabricating large-area structured scintillators, developed techniques to hermetically seal these extremely hygroscopic films, and through process optimizations, demonstrated a light yield of ~135,000 photons per thermal neutron interaction, which is the highest brightness amongst neutron scintillators. This was accomplished by meticulously adjusting the dopant concentration in the films and correlating the brightness to the dopant content. With such high brightness, new Anger cameras can reach sub-150 &#181;m spatial resolution. In the Phase IIA, protocols to produce large-area thick films will be optimized for consistency in performance and improved yields. This will require modifications to the deposition system enable uniform large area film fabrication. Films up to 2.5 mm in thickness with optimized composition will be fabricated and packaged using the latest advances in polymer and inorganic conformal coatings to create pinhole free moisture barriers. The efficacy of the scintillator will be demonstrated at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, with the goal of realizing sub-150 &#181;m spatial resolution, ~1&#215;10-7 gamma rejection and 80% neutron absorption efficiency. RMD’s scintillator/detector will be an excellent choice for neutron detectors for any facility that runs neutron experiments. For example, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, large-area detectors at the Spallation Neutron Source are used for neutron scattering experiments and in materials research for a variety of applications.

Many fields of science and applied science use X-rays to study matter at small and fast scales, and the knowledge from these experiments helps power the world economy. Powerful X-ray light source facilities such as synchrotrons and free electron lasers have been developed to study the structure of matter down to the atomic scale, and they can even create “molecular movies” of chemical reaction on time scales of picoseconds down to femtoseconds. To push the knowledge frontier of these sciences, X-ray sources are being continually upgraded for properties such as vastly increased brightness or needle-sharp focus. As a consequence, scientists come up against the limits of existing X-ray detectors to take pictures of intense X- ray pulses, and therefore they require new, advanced detectors with which to record their X-ray patterns. This grant will be used to develop high end detector sensing electronics, and with them design and produce a new high-resolution pixelated detector for taking high speed pictures of X-ray patterns. The grant will improve a detector design to better absorb and detect the X-rays without them passing through the sensor layer. This detector is special because it quickly integrates signals from X-ray patterns and can record intense pulses at orders of magnitude higher rate than is possible with existing commercial detector products used at these facilities. This detector is also a perfect companion for free electron laser sources, which have few suitable options for measuring the near-instantaneous X-ray diffraction and scattering patterns. The Phase IIA project builds on the Phase II project, the fruits of which were: the development of mechanical designs, cryogenic cooling, control software, and the improvement of the integrating circuits. A larger area detector and a better X-ray sensing material will be designed and produced under this grant, to capture more of the X-rays that are emitted during these experiments. The excellent data quality produced by this new detector will inform many branches of science utilizing the diffraction, scattering, and microscopy techniques at these X-ray facilities. Researchers will be able to develop useful new technologies, such as improve aerospace materials with stress and strain measurements, design faster better batteries or three-dimensional printing techniques, or even determine the structure and kinetics of biomolecules, leading to advances in medicine and pharmaceuticals.",  ,,,,Christine  Muchmore,,(847) 869-1548,cram@rayonix.com,,  ,

During this project we will complete development of the smallTalk NICU Active system and conduct a clinical trial to prove its efficacy in improving speech sound differentiation among hospitalized preterm infants. The device is designed to be used at an age equivalent to 32 weeks of gestation or older and to integrate readily into clinical practice for use by nurses and therapists staffing Level II to Level IV NICUs. Prototype research and development met or exceeded the stated technical milestones. In 2020, preterm birth affected 1 of every 10 infants born in the United States. Large numbers of infants are born daily requiring NICU stays. This NICU stay, while medically necessary, can result in impairments in the developing infant brain. In particular, there is a lack of exposure to infant directed parental or caretaker voice. It is known that exposure to infant directed speech, which is different from adult directed speech, is developmentally important for optimal, early brain development. The ability to differentiate speech sounds is a prerequisite for developing more complex receptive language. Infant directed speech, ideally when sought by an attentive infant, stimulates brain wiring and attunes the infant’s brain to speech sounds. For the developing infant brain, “plasticity” for language learning peaks during infancy, as the baby develops neural connections that enable differentiating their native language’s speech sounds. These connections are the foundation for more complex brain functions. Due in part to their time in NICU care, preterm infants have poorer receptive language scores at age two. A majority require speech and language intervention prior to school age. There is currently no intervention that addresses the problem of poor speech sound differentiation arising from NICU hospitalization, a period when the greatest potential for improving outcomes exists. This proposal seeks funding for the final product development and rigorous testing of the smallTalk NICU Active system. We will manufacture a small batch of the devices to support a proposed randomized clinical study at Emory University, the results of which will be submitted to FDA for clearance to market the innovative device.",  ,,,,DEAN R KOCH,,4402893656,dean@smalltalk.tech,,  ,

The majority of cancer deaths are caused by dissemination and growth of secondary tumors throughout
the body. While the 5-year survival rate for localized cancers has dramatically improved over the last
four decades of drug development, the survival rates for cancer patients with advanced or metastatic
disease remains abysmal, with median survival of Stage 4 patients at 10 months following diagnosis.
Patients diagnosed with advanced or metastatic cancers are furthermore considered terminal as
metastatic lesions are resistant to current therapeutic options. New therapeutic agents that can
effectively treat and enforce regression of advanced cancers or established metastases are urgently
needed in the therapeutic repertoire, yet only immune checkpoint blockade therapies have shown the
ability to prolong survival in a small subset of patients with Stage 4 cancer. Therefore, immunotherapies
with novel mechanisms of action and complementarity to current therapies are urgently needed to
increase the percentage of responding patients and improve cancer survival metrics in the United
States. Our academic collaborators as well as other leading academic laboratories have identified an
immunosuppressive signaling pathway driven by two complementary enzymes that is critical to the
progression of solid tumors by generating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Both our
discovery work and recently published studies demonstrate this pathway is a critical node in the
progression of multiple cancer types such as sarcoma, melanoma and breast cancer, yet prior
commercial and academic attempts to drug this pathway have failed due to lack of potency, specificity
and/or poor pharmacological properties. We are the first group to have developed lead compounds
against this pathway that show exceptional potency and specificity while avoiding the pharmacologic
liabilities of other drug development programs. Importantly, our therapies show promise in treating
advanced and metastatic cancers and are characterized by low nanomolar potency (lt50 nM, a 100-fold
improvement over published molecules), no off-target activity, high metabolic stability, excellent oral
pharmacokinetic properties and promising in vivo toxicology. Here we propose to nominate a
development candidate through pharmacodynamic assays, dose-range finding studies and
immunocompetent cancer models. The results of this research proposal will advance a first-in-class
therapy toward clinical testing with the aim of curing patients who were once diagnosed as incurable.
Specifically, the efficacy and preclinical data obtained from this application will support Phase 2 SBIR
studies leading to an IND application.",  ,,,,MARK  ESPOSITO,,(908) 731-6610,mark@kayothera.com,,  ,

Achieving high-quality science at nuclear physics facilities requires the measurement of particle energy with excellent calorimeter energy resolution in the momentum range 0.1 – (10-20) GeV/c. Crystals such as lead tungstate (PbWO4) have been used in precision calorimeters but their production is slow and expensive. This Phase I/II/IIA project addresses the need for alternative high performance scintillator materials by developing the basis to replace such crystals with scintillating glass that is simpler and faster to produce in large quantities while meeting the desired specifications. Phase I, established the formulation and fabrication techniques for producing small batches of SciGlass blocks. During Phase II, considerable progress was made on improvement of glass properties and the manufacturing process for blocks of ~15 radiation lengths (X0). Beam tests with a small detector prototype indicate, along with Geant4 simulations, that SciGlass has an energy resolution comparable to PbWO4 for block sizes of a comparable number of radiation lengths. The glass samples have excellent radiation resistance (no damage up to 1000 Gy electromagnetic and 1015 n/cm2 hadron irradiation, the highest doses tested to date), response time of 20-50 ns, and near-UV transmittance (78% at 440 nm). Phase II progress was impacted by Covid19 delays, particularly with respect to beam time. Phase IIA will allow for completing the balance of the Phase II objectives. Sufficient SciGlass bars will be produced to meet the objective of testing a larger, e.g., 5x5 detector prototype. This objective is supported by characterization results, simulations, and community feedback, and additional information that has become available on the EIC detectors. In addition, the block size will be optimized relative to the Moliere radius and the objective of demonstrating the ability to produce bars of various shapes will be completed, which, with newer information on the EIC detectors, is now much more relevant than when the original Phase II award started. The Phase IIA program is aligned to make SciGlass blocks available to meet the needs of key nuclear physics experiments, e.g., the large-volume calorimeters for the Electron-Ion Collider or JLab, that require high performance scintillator material in large quantities on specific schedules. Other SciGlass benefits include reduced time and complexity of manufacturing, resulting in an estimated 80% cost reduction, and increased flexibility in shape and size for the final detector. The ability to manufacture novel high-performance glass scintillators will prove useful not only for electromagnetic calorimeters but also for homeland security applications where such scintillators would significantly reduce the false alarm rate in passive nuclear detection systems and allow for large range of deployment. Fast response time and radiation hard glass ceramics will find use in the scintillator market for security applications as active material for radiation portal monitors, in particular, at ports where cargo screening with large throughput is required.",  ,,,,Tanja  Horn,,(757) 912-1728,horn@scintilex.com,Catholic University of America,Ralph  Albano,

One of the major limiting factors of these furnaces is the cooling rate. Currently, the vacuum furnace relies on radiation to dissipate heat and takes at least 2 hours to cool the furnace low enough to safely open for a sample change. This results in significant limitations of using expensive neutron beam time. To tackle this challenge, ACT proposes an innovative active cooling system to significantly reduce neutron scattering furnaces’ downtime. The system includes a closed helium (He) circulation loop, industrial-grade process control, furnace flow distribution nozzles, and a built-in refrigeration unit to achieve fast and controllable cooling. Due to the much higher thermal conductivity of the He gas compared to other inert gases (e.g., nitrogen, argon), heat can be removed from the system more effectively. By introducing the He flow inside the radiation shields via a flow distributor nozzle, the cooling rate can also be controlled by adjusting the flow rate and overall system pressure. The thermal characteristics and low neutron scattering and adsorption coefficients of He provide the potential for in- situ cooling for advanced material experiments. This will allow experimenters to perform controlled transient thermal tests that could not have been done before. The proposed active cooling system has very low He usage (closed-loop circulation) and requires a minimal human operation. During Phases I and II, a fully operational and mobile prototype cooling system was constructed and tested in the field with an operational HOT-006 neutron furnace at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The He cooling system managed to cool the heating element from 500&#176;C to 100&#176;C in just 8 minutes, a 17 times improvement compared to 2.24 hours for the original radiation-only cooling approach. The thermal stresses on the coil were evaluated, and a proof-of-concept constant cooling rate approach was demonstrated. The successful test at ORNL brings the technology to TRL (Technology Readiness Level) to 7. In Phase IIA, ACT will continue working with ORNL to refine the cooling system, extend its capabilities, and further push for the commercialization of the technology. It will be achieved by extended long-term usage tests at ORNL during mock and live neutron scattering experiments. Furthermore, the capabilities of the cooling system will be extended to include rapid sample quenching and a closed-loop controlled cooling rate. The cooling system will also be validated for operation with a cheaper, lower-performance circulation gas medium (nitrogen, argon) with our special nozzle design. ACT will also explore new industrial applications, such as specialized metal manufacturing (via high-pressure gas quench) and high-quality brazing (via controlled cooling rate inside the process furnace) that can be benefited from the proposed inert gas circulation cooling technology. In addition to the high-temperature neutron furnace cooling efforts, ACT will also investigate a novel cryogenic cooling method to aid ORNL with the long cooldown time of dry He cryostats. ACT aims to reduce a 2-hour cooldown time (300K to 80K) to less than 10 minutes with the innovative sample holder with embedded two-phase nitrogen flow. A range of unique solutions will be utilized to improve the heat exchange limited by the Leidenfrost effect. The impact of reduced cooldown time on cryogenic experiments turnaround should be similar to the effect of a cooling system on neutron furnaces.",  ,,,,Patryk  Radyjowski,,(717) 205-0603,patryk.radyjowski@1-act.com,,  ,

CMTx Biotech is a drug development company working to commercialize a proprietary, clinical-stage, small-
molecule drug candidate for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and its long-term sequelae,
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), in preterm infants. BPD is a chronic respiratory disease that occurs in
preterm infants who develop RDS from a combination of lung immaturity, inflammation, and mechanical injury
from ventilation. BPD is the most common adverse outcome of preterm delivery, affecting up to 75% of infants
born before 28 weeks of gestation worldwide. Every year in the U.S., approximately 380,000 of these infants
are born, of which 50,000 are extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs), 35% (18,000) of which
develop BPD. The median cost of hospitalization associated with BPD during the first year in very low birth
weight infants is $377,871 per infant, compared to $175,836 per infant without BPD. There are currently no
FDA-approved drugs specifically for the prevention and treatment of BPD. The current standard of care is
focused on minimizing lung damage and providing respiratory support with the use of bronchodilators,
diuretics, antibiotics, surfactant, and steroids, including antenatal steroid treatment of the mother before
preterm birth. Most agents that are prescribed to prevent BPD are also used for the management of
established BPD, and these therapies lack solid evidence of efficacy. A recent clinical study concluded that
hydrocortisone is not effective at preventing BPD in premature infants or improving their survival. There
remains a critical unmet need for safe and effective therapeutics for the prevention of BPD. Our lead
drug candidate is a pleiotropic matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) modulator which inhibits pathologically-
excessive collagenolysis and resolves systemic inflammation. Safety of the compound has already been
demonstrated in Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies. The drug has been evaluated in a number of
clinical trials for the treatment of diseases as disparate as AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma, recurrent high-
grade gliomas, refractory metastatic cancer, acne, rosacea and periodontitis. The Specific Aims of this STTR
are to determine the ability of our lead drug candidate to prevent the onset of BPD in a preterm piglet model,
and to evaluate its effect on the pathogenesis of BPD and inflammatory pathways. Our long-term goal is to
obtain approval from the FDA and comparable international regulatory authorities to market our drug candidate
as a safe and effective intervention. We anticipate that our drug candidate will inhibit BPD progression, mitigate
acute lung injury and respiratory distress, reduce the need for intensive care and intubation, and improve
clinical outcomes for pre-term infants, including overall survival. Successful completion of these studies will
allow CMTx Biotech to advance our lead drug candidate towards clinical trials for the prevention of BPD.",  ,,,,MICHAELA C KOLLISCHSINGULE,,(315) 464-6308,kolliscm@upstate.edu,UPSTATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY,  ,

As part of the Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) program, the Army currently builds Soldier Performance Readiness Centers (SPRC) for weekly training. The current construction costs of $16 million or more are prohibitively expensive, and reduced capacity will not allow the Army to achieve the training goals of bringing in Soldiers multiple times per week. Therefore, the Army is searching for innovative materials and methods for driving down construction costs as compared to using conventional methods. Traditional construction methods such as red iron, concrete masonry, and stick framing rely on heavy structural components with inefficient foundations and costly onsite labor which significantly drives up construction costs through wasted materials and labor hours. By employing manufacturing methods and materials which radically reduce the time and cost of construction, we will develop, build, and furnish operational human performance spaces [SPRCs] designed to generate athletes [lethal Soldiers] who are physically capable and mentally tough, focusing on all aspects of improving human performance optimization and mental fortitude, ultimately delivering a solution to provide approximately 110 SPRCs for each ARMY brigade by FY2030. Some manufacturing methods considered in Phase I will include fiber reinforced composites (FRPs), aircretes for reduced concrete usage and improved thermal performance, light gauge steel factory prefabricated offices and partitions, and other innovative processes and materials. We are equipped to approach the design of SPRCs by integrating extensive construction, materials and innovation knowledge paired with operational and functional expertise of human performance spaces. Importantly, consideration toward the unique needs of each user with regard to nutrition, mental health, and physical ability needs are of top priority in the design of each unit. To this end, our team consists of unique and successful and experienced individuals bringing together expertise ranging from construction, military service, to human performance and development. We strive to address the current gaps in pivotal areas of the holistic health and fitness of our military personnel by providing an effective, simple solution that enables them to establish, build, and maintain optimal mental and physical health and wellbeing facilities in any environment. We present our team’s knowledge, time, and experience to tackle the problems presented in this SBIR, and we look forward to utilizing these results to commercialize new building methods and holistic performance spaces.",Zach  Harrell,,() -,zachary.j.harrell6.civ@army.mil,Joseph  Moon,,(530) 828-2593,joseph.moon@blacklabsports.com,,  ,

Burchell Professional Group Inc. is proposing an innovative, low cost, semi-portable SPFC modular building design with a traditional slab foundation. The building will be composed of modules built and assembled in a factory which will be designed to be delivered as preassembled modules that are quickly bolted together onsite greatly speeding construction and reducing costs as well as building being easily disassembled for moving to new locations as separate modules. Each module will come with all systems installed such as insulation (sound and thermal), internet components, electrical wires, plumbing as well as HVAC components. A traditional slab foundation will be imbedded with water supply lines, sewage drain pipes, and attaching hardware (studs) to bolt the wall sill plats and beam modules to for integral strong construction. Likewise, the roof structure will be all be composed of steel roof truss modules again assembled by bolting together. A durable stainless steel roof system tops the roof trusses  and will ensure a long service life exceeding all requirements. The primary construction of most structural components will be of steel for long maintenance-free life and excellent strength to resist all types of loads as well as being fireproof and insect resistant.The exterior siding will also be composed of stainless steel sheets that are corrogated for additional strength. The doors are the exception which will be constructed of hard anodized aluminum to meet Army requirements. High efficiency, durable LED diffuse lighting fixtures will illuminate the SPFC throughout without causing glare. All flooring materials and all surface textures will be in compliance with all requirements. All systems and fixtures will be in compliance with the stated Army's requirements. In summary, steel will be the primary construction material used to construct the SPFC in easily bolted together module form because besides providing superior strength, superior fire resistance, superior maintenance-free properties compared to wood, steel also has more reliable and stable strength properties allowing for optimized design reducing material costs, and is more suited to mass production of modules to drive down costs by dramatically reducing one of the single largest cost - labor. No custom fitting and cutting of structural members onsite will be required! This innovative SPFC  building composed of primarily steel modules bolted together with all systems imbedded in them will dramatically reduce costs (labor and material) and greatly speed construction while meeting or exceeding all the Army's requirements. ",Zach  Harrell,,() -,zachary.j.harrell6.civ@army.mil,David W  Burchell,,(316) 992-2616,williamburchell@att.net,,  ,

While significant outbreaks of the flu in the recent past involving millions of individuals could be contained, the emergence and rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus revealed how vulnerable and unprepared the world population was to combat a previously unknown human pathogen.  To limit the loss of life and economic disruption resulting from a future global event, steps toward pandemic preparedness are needed. A major component of being prepared is having the necessary tools available to act quickly to protect human health. In the ongoing pandemic, vaccines emerged as the best way to protect healthy populations and prevent hospitalization or death among those individuals who become infected. However, vaccine availability and logistical constraints regarding their distribution has left a significant proportion of the world’s population still waiting for their first dose. The ability to quickly discover and develop vaccines which can be administered on a large scale is one solution towards solving this current problem.  In support of this effort, it is the goal of this Phase I project to identify TLR4 agonists with immunostimulatory activity suitable for the development of safe and effective vaccine adjuvants. To achieve this goal, we will combine our years of expertise in medicinal chemistry and vaccine research and development toward completing the following specific aims: 1) Establish efficient synthesis routes for pure tri-acylated monophosphate derivatives of sucrose; 2) Identify TLR4 agonists using cell-based assays, determine their cytokine production profiles, and compare them to the full TLR4 agonist mono-phospholipid A (MPLA); and 3) Determine the immunogenic potency and safety profiles of selected sucrose based TLR4 agonists in mice and compare them against an existing subunit protein vaccines targeting West Nile Virus. We expect the product from this research to enable the development of novel adjuvants to support the preparation of new vaccines to combat current and future disease threats.",  ,,,,ALAN T JOHNSON,,8087921302,johnson@hibiotech.com,,  ,

Key measures of performance identified within the TO include cost, timelines, and throughput. Other items such as customer satisfaction scores will be utilized during certain phases of the project to create a robust feedback system ensuring end user requirements are met and/or exceeded. We will leverage our custom design/build methodology while using a multi-system approach to scoping the design. This multi-system approach offers modular options in order to ensure flexibility during the scoping portion. The final prototype concept will be selected based on end user feedback derived during the Phase I Period of Performance (PoP).  (TO1) Reduction of overall project costs through the utilization of advanced material technologies Key Result/Metric of Success: On target budget of $6 million or less (TO2) Development of infrastructure via modular construction methodologies that increase economies of scale and reduce project lead times Key Result/Metric of Success: Project lead times less than 270 days with scalability to support 110 facilities across all brigades. (TO3) Cross Domain Integration of physical and non-physical performance modalities Key result/Metric of Success: The facility incorporates spaces and characteristics necessary to accommodate H2F teams and specialists to help Soldiers train, sleep, and eat more effectively while enhancing mental and spiritual health. (TO4) Optimized facility design (flow, throughput, output and utilization) via collaboration with performance industry subject matter experts Key Result/Metric of Success: Maximum throughput is achieved enabling individuals from the intended Brigades to access the SPRC a minimum of two to three times per week. Through this robust approach, BeaverFit intends to assist the Army in overcoming the challenges to design and development of the SPRC. Our proposed design enables the Army to execute the cultural shift necessary to optimize warfighter readiness and fully implement H2F per regulatory guidance and governing principles.  ",Zach  Harrell,Dr.,() -,zachary.j.harrell6.civ@army.mil,Brian  Carey,,(619) 871-0986,brian.carey@beaverfitusa.com,,  ,

Utilizing an already proven air-supported structure, our proposal will reduce overall project costs, timelines, and construction risk while maintaining all of the structural qualities of conventional construction. With the current allotment budget of up to $6 million dollars ASATI is capable of building a facility up to 80,000 square feet and 80 feet tall. This larger facility would provide additional capabilities for the Brigades which we will be expanded on below. ASATI proposes manufacturing a facility that meets all of the criteria of the SPRC, as laid out in the Army Corps of Engineers Full SPRC Standard Tier 1 floor plan. Our design features an indoor track and a turf field that would allow all six elements of the Army Combat Fitness Test and training to be conducted indoors during any weather condition.  These proposed upgrades to the SPRC will allow personal to not only elevate their ability to perform but enhance their quality of life during their time of service. ASATI has teamed up with Green Eagle and to test an alternative to concrete solution utilizing a  new and innovative eco-friendly floor system. This system is strong enough to withstand the weight of an eighteen wheeler and alleviate the stress on soldiers joints that concrete flooring can generate. This floor system is also unique in its ability to adhere a multiple of different floor tops ranging from rubber to teak wood. In addition Green Eagle has a wall system that will interlock into this floor system for all the office requirements laid out in this Tier 1 floor plan. This system will dramatically decrease the build time for all the internal construction under the air structure. ASATI is a US-based air-supported structure manufacturing company. As the inventor of the air structure, ASATI has pioneered the industry by designing, building, and manufacturing every single ""first of its kind"" air structure which ranges across recreational, industrial, and military uses. With 27 Patents we have solved various industries' problems globally. From the heat of Dubai to the snows of Alaska, ASATI has provided climate-controlled spaces so work/play could continue uninterrupted by the elements. With a larger facility option the end user could tailor it to include a basketball/volley ball court, indoor soccer field/ football field, a dedicated area for the ACFT elements T-Pushups and medicine ball training. With the height and size of the air structure, airborne and air assault units have the ability to have a 70 foot tower under the air structure to facilitate unique unit training requirements. This larger facility could also be used to practice flying small recon drones and be utilized for an inclement option for a variety of ceremonies. ",Zach  Harrell,,() -,zachary.j.harrell6.civ@army.mil,Donato  Fraioli,,(914) 417-1262,Donato@asati.com,,  ,

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common liver diseases in children and adults
associated with diet-associated hepatic lipid accumulation (steatosis), and is a common hepatic manifestation of
obesity and metabolic syndromes including diabetes. Modulation Therapeutics is developing a stearoyl-
coenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD1) inhibitor for the treatment of NAFLD and NASH. The novel lead molecule
referred to as MTI-301 is orally bioavailable and well-tolerated. Pilot data with MTI-301 in mice fed a Western
high fat diet attenuated the liver steatosis and significantly improved liver function. We will leverage data
generated in pre-clinical models of both a Western high fat diet as well as a Methionine-choline-deficient (MCD)
diet to test the efficacy of MTI-301 as anti-steatosis single agent treatment option. In this proposal we will test
our central hypothesis that sustained inhibition of SCD1 with the clinical lead molecule, MTI-301 as a
single agent, will attenuate hepatic lipogenesis, reduce triglyceride accumulation, as well as reduce the
liver injury, in diet-induced rodent models of NAFLD/NASH. To test our hypothesis in specific aim 1 we
will utilize a well-established murine model of NAFDL and NASH and treat with different doses of MTI-301 In
specific aim 2, we will evaluate the combination therapy of MTI-301 with pioglitazone, an anti-diabetic drug.
Since obesity and metabolic syndromes contribute to the development of liver steatosis, we expect the
combination to be reduce the liver dysfunction significantly. Prevention or reversal of liver steatosis is a
significant therapeutic goal which can prevent multiple secondary metabolic disorders which increases morbidity
and mortality worldwide.",  ,,,,LORI  HAZLEHURST,,(813) 335-7401,hazlehurst@modulationtherapeutics.com,WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY,  ,

Of the 20,000 genes in the human genome, approximately 4,000 are considered “druggable” by
pharmaceuticals. However, less than 10% of these druggable proteins are actually targeted by FDA-approved
drugs. In 2014, the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project was launched by the NIH in recognition
that there is a potentially large number of druggable targets with high therapeutic value that are undiscovered
or understudied. The IDG selected 230 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels as a focus of
their program, as these families make up the largest families of the druggable genome and have high potential
to impact human health. Due to their difficult biology, many of them are completely unexplored. To enable this
research, the IDG has called for the development of reagents such as monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against
these 230 GPCRs and ion channels, only 10% of which currently have commercially available MAbs. A novel
approach to identify membrane protein MAbs in a high-throughput manner is needed to derive MAbs against
the entire druggable human membrane proteome.",  ,,,,ROSS  CHAMBERS,,(215) 966-6061,rchambers@integralmolecular.com,,  ,

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a significant, worldwide health problem affecting an estimated 14 million
people in the US. It is characterized by hepatic inflammation and injury and fibrosis. Subjects diagnosed with
NASH are at significantly increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Without any currently available FDA approved treatments, NASH has become a significant unmet medical need.
In NASH patients, lipid accumulation along with generation of lipotoxic intermediates leads to the induction of
cell stress triggering apoptotic, inflammatory, and fibrotic signaling pathways. Reactive aldehydes, the product
of oxidative modification (i.e. peroxidation) of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), can bind proteins by indirect
or secondary protein modification, resulting in an increased risk for aggregation, loss of function, and cell
damage. Published evidence points to the critical role of 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), the most abundant reactive
aldehyde, contributing to the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and NASH. 4-HNE has
been implicated as a specific driver of multiple pathways in NASH etiology including: a) loss of insulin inhibition
of adipocyte lipolytic activity leading to increased fatty acid flux to the liver and generation of lipotoxic products,
b) direct activation of inflammatory pathways, and c) as the direct driver of hepatic stellate cell activation and
liver fibrosis. While 4-HNE production results from lipid peroxidation, the ability to control its levels by
endogenous or exogenous antioxidants is limited; lipophilic reservoirs can provide a long-lasting discharge of 4-
HNE beyond the temporal source of oxidant generation. Therefore, controlling 4-HNE levels represents a unique
and novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of NASH.
TamuroBio has synthesized a new chemical entity, TB-019, that is able to act as a nucleophilic scavenger. TB-
019 binds to 4-HNE, thereby reducing its levels in cells and has been shown in two rodent models of NASH to
be effective in reducing liver fat, inflammation, and fibrosis progression. TB-019 has favorable physicochemical
and ADME properties, as well as a preliminary good safety profile. This proposal aims to complete IND-enabling
GLP safety and toxicology studies and to produce drug supply for the Phase I first-in human trial. This work will
be performed by high quality contract research organizations in the US, overseen by the experienced team at
TamuroBio.
In summary, the overall goal of TamuroBio is to develop TB-019 as a novel therapeutic for the treatment of NASH
and to mitigate the progression of fibrosis.",  ,,,,MAHMOUD N GHAZZI,,(734) 649-9744,mahmoud@tamurobio.com,,  ,

The specific focus is on prior authorization processing, where payers and prescribers must reach a consensus on medical necessity. The project delivers a solution to optimize prescription authorization and provide more comprehensive patient histories for clinical authorization criteria fulfillment than other available products on the current health technology market. Lack of efficient access to reliable patient histories is the principal reason for delayed authorizations, resulting in delayed care access. A 2022 survey showed 93% of physicians reported that prior authorization often or always creates care delays; 82% reported delays that led to treatment abandonment. A secure yet progressively decentralized patient data transfer protocol would heighten transparency of clinical decision-making processes and also increase opportunities for patient engagement during prior authorization of medical prescriptions. Further, since administrative costs increase the cost of benefits, which in turn increases the cost of care access, the potential commercial impact is that payers who lower administrative costs will be better positioned to offer higher reimbursement rates for a greater range of quality treatment options, at increasingly lower cost._x000D_
_x000D_
This SBIR Phase II project proposes to deliver a distributed ledger with smart contracts specific to the domain of pharmaceutical benefits. Since the cause of processing inefficiency lies with siloed and incomplete patient histories, this protocol resolves administrative inefficiencies through distributed ledger technology supporting fast and compliant encrypted health data sharing among prescribers, payers, and patients. Research objectives include: 1) automating criteria fulfillment to reduce administrative waste; 2) leveraging machine learning to automate simpler case reviews; and 3) designing a shared interorganizational processing protocol capable of adapting to an introduction of revised clinical standards. Smart contracts will be deployed to a distributed ledger infrastructure to formalize and enforce clinical standards as well as contractually specified financial rules and actuarial analyses at an interorganizational level. With smart contracts embedded in the authorization process to automatically curate more robust clinical histories over each prescription lifecycle, available real world data meeting contractually specified quality standards for clinical review will increase. Historical authorization data will feed back into incrementally complex cases, advancing artificial intelligence for authorization decision support. The expected result is improved real-time insight into clinical risk, affording payers the ability to financially and strategically adapt to patient needs with increasing precision and agility._x000D_

One case dear to Arima is a teenage girl who was diagnosed with advanced brain cancer. Her tumor had been tested twice using state-of-the-art NGS-based lab developed tests (LDTs), but no actionable genetic driver could be found, classifying her tumor as “driver-negative”, precluding access to targeted therapies and greatly reducing her likelihood of survival. However, thanks to the parental phase-2 award, Arima had just developed an NGS technology platform – the T-Seq kit – to detect tumor driving translocations and gene fusions from tumor biopsies. Lo and behold, when T-Seq analyzed this patient’s tumor, it revealed a translocation implicating PD-L1, triggering a series of events leading to treatment with pembrolizumab and 9 months later no signs of tumor, all thanks to T-Seq. This proposal strives to scale this clinical origin story to make a widespread impact in the 50% of patients with advanced cancers and no detectable genetic drivers (~488,000 patients per year in US). However, to make this widespread impact, T-Seq technology must be made available to oncologist and pathologist in the form of an LDT. The overarching goal of this proposal is to execute all necessary steps to develop and validate T-Seq kits so that they can be supplied to CLIA labs who will validate and deploy T-Seq as an LDT to inform clinical care. Thanks to our parental phase-2, execution towards this goal has already begun. From a tech perspective T- Seq kits are more sensitive than existing tech because they profile translocations through the lens of a spatial 3D genome, rather than a linear genome, enabling detection of tumor driving translocations like PD-L1 that are otherwise missed. T-Seq technology has also been productized, meeting all the key product products for deployment as an LDT, culminating in the launch of a kitted end-to-end T-Seq workflow. Lastly, T-Seq kit performance is concordant with existing tech, yet it detects tumor-driving translocations in 54% of driver- negative tumors, including 4 patients where the course of clinical care has been altered thanks to T-Seq. With a product in hand and foundational clinical data, the proposed aims accomplish the remaining steps towards our goal of becoming a tech provider to CLIA labs. Specifically, this proposal first aims to establish competitive analytical performance metrics for T-Seq. Then it aims to demonstrate clinical validity and utility of T-Seq across mainline tumor types, and in clinical contexts of severe unmet need. Lastly, the proposal aims to validate and deploy T-Seq kits in partnering academic and commercial CLIA laboratories. The success of each proposed aims is measured using multiple quantitative metrics relevant to that aim, informed by CLIA assay validation guidelines and key metrics defined by stakeholders in the LDT ecosystem. By the conclusion of the phase-2b program, the ultimate goal of becoming a technology provider to CLIA labs will be accomplished, whereby T-Seq kits will be deployed as LDTs in initial academic and commercial CLIA labs, and clinical data, publications, and awareness of T-Seq will be established to accelerate future adoption of T-Seq as an LDT.",  ,,,,SIDDARTH  SELVARAJ,,5059483116,sid@arimagenomics.com,,  ,

The cost for healthcare and society is unbearable: becauseof cancer, $180B healthcare expenditure and $134B lost productivity are recorded every year. This is happeningdespite recent advancements in therapy and the emergence of an ever expanding array of new therapeutics forthe over 1.8M new cancer patients every year. Indeed, because of the multitude and redundancy of mechanismscontributing to cancer growth, therapies are often ineffective. Several components should be targeted at thesame time in order to maximize therapy outcome. However, this is particular hard to attain because of 1) thestriking variability among cancers and the limited number of cancer specific targets 2) the ability of cancer cellsto orchestrate a microenvironment of healthy tissue and cells around them, that promote cancer growth andtherapy resistance. Boston Immune Technologies and Therapeutics (BITT) is developing BITT-1492, able totarget both cancer cells and their microenvironment. BITT-1492 is an antagonist antibody against TNFR2 – areceptor highly expressed in cancer tissue and immune suppressive cells in the microenvironment, where itmediates pro-survival signaling. Thanks to BITT’s proprietary antibody design platform, BITT-1492 is the firstand only antibody able to dominantly shut down TNFR2 signaling. Due to selective expression and key role ofTNFR2 for a variety of cancers and tumor microenvironment cells, BITT-1492 will find application in the therapyof several cancers, starting with Cutaneous T cell Lymphoma (CTCL), where TNFR2 is known to act as anextremely potent oncogene.

The hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is the key neuroendocrine system that controls peripheral responses to stress. While the stress response is essential for survival, it can become dysregulated. Hyperactivity of the HPA characterizes a variety of illnesses including alcohol use disorder (AUD). HPA hyperactivity is characterized by higher production of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and glucocorticoids.  This Phase II SBIR aims to develop a novel biologic therapeutic aimed at normalizing pathologic HPA hyperactivity. Medications to modulate the HPA axis are currently sub-optimal. Therapeutic attempts to use glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists have shown some promise in conditions like AUD and depression. However, chronically blocking GR-mediated effects can be counterproductive as, for instance, it interferes with glucocorticoid negative feedback, leading to increased cortisol levels and mineralocorticoid receptor activation. CRF receptor type 1 (CRF1) antagonists have been extensively explored, but thus far have proven disappointing, possibly because of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties of the existing drugs. Therefore, the identification of novel therapeutics to normalize hyperactivity of the HPA axis represents an area of significant unmet medical need.  This proposal will optimize a lead validated in the Phase I SBIR and establish a stable cell line for the production of material for the eventual Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies and clinical trials. Altogether, the present project will lay the foundations for the clinical development of a first-in-class therapeutic for AUD and potentially for other conditions characterized by HPA axis hyperactivity.",  ,,,,LINDA S LLOYD,,6192264096,lindalloyd01@gmail.com,,  ,

One of the most promising technologies, molten salt reactors, will require commercial production of large quantities of enriched lithium-7. Even longer term, many of the fusion energy technologies in development will require enriched lithium-6. The planned production of lithium isotopes will enable the development and commercialization of safer, lower-impact nuclear energy._x000D_

The innovation will use a robot to provide quantitative condition and emissions data for an estimated 150,000 floating roof tanks in the nation’s aging infrastructure. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and similar agencies across the globe, require tanks to be routinely inspected, but companies also want to remove personnel from confined spaces and avoid exposure to poisonous gasses, asphyxiation, heat exhaustion, falling accidents, etc. Confined space entries caused 1,300 U.S. deaths between 2011 and 2018. The autonomous robot reduces expenses related to maintenance and repair and allows better quantitative assessment of the seal integrity, which allows companies to perform maintenance based on the asset condition and not frequency-based schedules. An industry trend in recent years is to recreate the state of their assets digitally - both visually and quantitatively. The high-resolution data provided through this effort supports these 'digital twins.' Also, once the robot is certified for explosive environments, design features can be reused to produce other robots which further improve development cost and safety. _x000D_
_x000D_
This SBIR Phase I project will create an autonomous robotic inspection system which eliminates manual, confined-space inspection methods and requires only one technician to deploy the robot from the top of the tank wall. The wall-climbing robot is capable of inspecting both the floating-roof storage tank’s upper (weather) and lower (primary) seals using a bifurcated (inverse periscope) geometry which places sensors in the gap between the seals while prime movers, adhesion elements, and a controller are above the seals. The bifurcated design simplifies safety feature design by minimizing the size and complexity of device components between the seals. The bifurcated design enables the continuous use of a tether for isolating the power source and provides a positive pressure surge system. After insertion, the robot proceeds to circumnavigate the inner tank shell in a stable manner, overcoming the large frictional forces that exist between the tank wall and the upper seal. The robotic system gathers real-time, high-resolution, and continuous data about the state of the seals. High-resolution visual data characterizes the top of the seal, and a proprietary physical “feeler” mechanism characterizes the seal gap. This information results in a fast, safe, and accurate inspection of the tank’s seal._x000D_

Given the multifaceted5 underlying pathology of cardiovascular disease, polypharmacy approaches are applied to target individual risk6 factors but with limited success due to various drug side effects, lack of synergy, and low patient adherence.7 Fish oils effectively lower hypertriglyceridemia, and omega-3 fatty acids-based treatments are approved by FDA8 to treat this condition. We discovered a minor component of fish oil, also present in FDA-approved omega-3-9 based drugs, that is more potent in eliciting these effects. Using a medicinal chemistry approach, we designed,
10 synthesized, tested, and optimized a series of compounds with improved metabolic stability and therapeutic
11 potency. The lead compound, FA-1011, demonstrated significant protection in a high-fat diet NAFLD mouse
12 model, reducing circulating cholesterol, triglycerides, hepatic steatosis, inflammatory markers caused by a
13 significant hepatic metabolic rewiring. The protective, anti-inflammatory effect and the improvement in circulating
14 lipid profile led us to hypothesize that FA-1011 could tackle the multifactorial cardiovascular disease by reducing
15 plaque formation, normalizing dyslipidemia, alleviating insulin resistance, and soliciting anti-inflammatory
16 responses. In particular, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following Specific Aims:
17 Aim 1: Evaluate the absorption, distribution, and metabolism of FA-1011.
18 Aim 2: Define the protection of FA-1011 against atherosclerosis in ApoE–/– mice.
19 The multidisciplinary approach involved in the project including synthetic chemistry, mass spectrometer-based
20 analytics, and animal pharmacokinetics and pharmacology will definitively reveal the ADME, validate the anti-
21 atherosclerotic impact and characterize the modes of action of the lead compound FA-1011. The successful
22 outcomes of this project will result in a solid preclinical candidate ready for IND-enabling studies, and greatly
23 accelerate its translation to real clinical value for patients with excessive cardiovascular risk burden.
24 The team leading this effort is experienced and has participated in several preclinical and clinical studies (5
25 Phase I and 2 Phase II) in related disease areas. In addition, the team is supported by significant collaborators
26 and consultants to successfully execute the proposed research plan.

The resulting unmet health needs have had a disproportionate effect among older Americans as they continue to be at the highest mortality risk for the latest variants of COVID-19. Additional health disparities due to race, gender, residential location, and income have been exacerbated by COVID-19, further limiting equitable access to healthcare across the lifespan. These and other challenges have hastened the shift to other modes of healthcare such as telehealth. Yet, while Zoom and other apps have facilitated remote patient-clinician videoconferencing as the most common forms of telehealth, they do little to provide direct physical examination needed for evaluating musculoskeletal (MSK) deficits, planning therapeutic interventions, or guiding exercise compliance—essential components of evidence-based practice among rehabilitation practitioners. This is especially true for obtaining measures of joint mobility, alignment, posture, balance, strength, and function from osteoarthritis (OA) disorders; cornerstones for planning therapeutic interventions and guiding exercise compliance. Our team of biomechanists and computer vision engineers will continue our Phase I partnership with orthopedic and geriatric rehabilitation specialists at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) to advance the development of an augmented reality (AR) platform that enables clinicians to visualize key rehabilitative outcome measures to augment remote telehealth interactions during a video conference with their patient. Our Phase I work demonstrated the proof-of-concept that standard 3D-cameras available in common consumer devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets/PCs) when coupled with post-processing body tracking algorithms can deliver accurate rehabilitation outcome measures from patients with knee OA during a simulated telehealth visit. In Phase II we will expand our 3D body tracking algorithms and AR Platform architecture to support a broader set of assessment protocols that accommodate a diverse array of human and home environment factors (Aim 1); enable real-time cross-platform deployment for HIPAA-compliant communication and presentation of outcomes on a clinician’s screen (Aim 2); and validate the prototype during sessions involving clinic-based physical therapist and a person with knee OA remotely located in their home across urban, suburban, and rural locations (Aim 3). Stakeholders will complete self-report questionnaires for usability, acceptance, and perceived value followed by brief guided interviews and focus group evaluations. Our milestone is a clinically viable and operationally effective prototype AR Telehealth Platform that is favorably rated by clinicians and patients for use in the home. The long-term impact will expand access to rehabilitation specialists using telehealth tools that provide evidence-based evaluations of musculoskeletal deficits needed for guiding therapeutic interventions among at-risk segments of the population.",  ,,,,BHAWNA  SHIWANI,,5085458217,bshiwani@altecresearch.com,,  ,

Executive Summary Pancreatic cancer has a depressing 5-year survival rate estimated at 12%. The dismal outlook is due to myriad issues, including the fact that patients are asymptomatic in early stages combined with the lack of screening tools. One window to earlier detection is through pancreatic cystic lesions detected incidentally in routine imaging analyses for diagnosis of unrelated disorders. These patients are at an increased risk for pancreatic cancer. Unfortunately, imaging is insufficient for distinguishing benign cysts from those likely to progress to cancer forcing clinicians to rely on biochemical analyses of acellular cyst fluid. The current assays display poor accuracy and require large volumes of fluid not always available limiting their clinical utility. There is a profound unmet clinical need for diagnostics that accurately grade dysplasia in mucinous pancreatic cyst fluids. The objective of current SBIR Phase I grant (CA277913-01A1 effective May 2023) is to develop and conduct clinical translation of a diagnostic assay panel using ultrasensitive detection methods to grade dysplasia in pancreatic cysts. This assay will stratify patients most at risk for progression to cancer thus providing high clinical utility. The platform: Amplified Sciences has utilized a proprietary platform to translate to the company roscopy platform is robust and readily adaptable to other proteolytic enzymes as needed for this grant. To date, the company has made strong progress on the Aims. The team has built a new direct-detection SERS ligand binding platform (prototype stage) for two of the biomarkers, and adapted the existing enzymatic activity assay for a third. Over 90 retrospective clinical samples have been procured, and all clinical testing and statistical analysis should be complete by end of Phase 1. The company is on track -ready assay protocol for full clinical validation and algorithm development in a Phase 2 grant. Several challenges have been met and overcome. Technical challenges including delays in the supply chain have been overcome by securing new suppliers for chemicals, etc. Administrative challenges include delays from securing invoices from vendors, so more frequent reminders have been implemented. Finally, commercial challenges include limited funding for market research with doctors and payers to gain the insights needed to prepare for commercial launch and challenges in accessing clinicians at large academic centers. To overcome this, the company has leveraged current clinical investigators for introductions. Finally, the current capital market for fundraising is very challenging so the company has supplemented investor funds with non-dilutive funding totaling $1M of research use only revenue and state and federal grants. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Validate a combination of three (3) protease activity markers to accurately distinguish low- grade from high-grade mucinous pancreatic cystic neoplasms. Aim 2: To develop quantitative assays for a panel of three (3) markers in low-volume mock cyst fluid samples that enable diagnostic power evaluation in a clinical sample cohort.

In the context of defense medicine, severe muscle trauma often occurs in environments where external factors such as sterility are not well-controlled. This project is expected to demonstrate antimicrobial properties of this novel muscle-regenerating biomaterial to enable use in these environments. If successful, the broader societal and economic impacts of antimicrobial muscle-regenerating biomaterials are staggering. Volumetric muscle loss affects tens of millions of victims each year. Sixty percent of patients are left untreated, 30% receive a muscle flap transplant, and 10% of injured limbs are amputated. Total average lifetime costs for amputation now total over $700,000. Improved clinical outcomes resulting from the implementation of this technology could lead to hundreds of thousands of dollars in savings over the course of each recipient's lifetime._x000D_
_x000D_
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project demonstrates significant advances over the existing standard of care for the treatment of volumetric muscle loss, for which no treatment currently exists. The joint loss of cells and extracellular matrix creates an environment where muscle regeneration cannot occur, leading to muscle collapse and atrophy over time. This project effectively replaces the extracellular matrix lost in volumetric muscle loss and creates an environment where satellite cells may proliferate and differentiate into new muscle tissue. A technical concern raised by clinicians, especially those who work in austere environments in military medicine, is the risk of infection caused by implanting a foreign substance into a wound bed. To address this, Technical Objective 1 will focus on incorporating antibacterial agents to optimize the scaffold’s ability to promote muscle regeneration while also having an antibacterial effect. Structural and mechanical properties will be assessed, cellular viability ensured, muscle cell quality evaluated, and antibacterial properties measured. Technical Objective 2 aims to investigate these outcomes with a pilot porcine model of muscle trauma. It is anticipated that the proposed antimicrobial biomaterial will both combat the risk of infection and effectively regenerate functional muscle in traumatic muscle injuries._x000D_

Opioid misuse has reached epidemic levels in the U.S., claiming the lives of more than 104,000 people in the
twelve months up to February 2022 alone. Opioids are highly addictive and are accompanied by severe
withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, generalized pain, insomnia, and flu-like symptoms that contribute to
relapse. Opioid overdose, misuse, and dependence result in an estimated $35B in health care costs, $14B in
criminal justice costs, and $92B in lost productivity each year in the U.S. Medications for opioid use disorder
(MOUD), which combines behavioral counseling with agonist drug therapies such as buprenorphine or
methadone to manage withdrawal, is an evidence-based, whole-patient approach to treating opioid dependence.
It has been shown to decrease opioid use and deaths from overdose and increase social functioning and
treatment retention. However, establishing the correct initial dose of an opioid agonist to administer during the
MOUD induction phase is difficult; low doses may fail to alleviate withdrawal symptoms and increase the risk of
relapse, while high doses may fail to reduce the risk of overdose. Such factors present a barrier to patient
retention through the MOUD induction phase, and providers currently lack methods for patient monitoring that
could inform improved dosing protocols. OpiAID, Inc is addressing this unmet need with the Strength Band
Platform, an innovative AI-based digital platform that enables patient monitoring throughout the MOUD induction
period. Patient biometrics are captured via a wearable device with a multi-sensor array and are used by our
proprietary algorithm to detect relapse and withdrawal during MOUD induction. This first-of-its-kind technology
aims to enable physicians to implement just-in-time interventions to enhance patient retention, prevent relapse,
and improve the management of withdrawal symptoms. Our pilot studies have shown that our platform can
gather and synthesize the biometric data needed for composite quantification and timely identification of acute
opioid use and withdrawal. However, our work was done using a research-grade device, the Empatica E4, whose
price point and limited adoption may hinder marketability. Building upon this work, we intend to expand our
platform to accommodate commercially available and widely adopted devices like the WHOOP Strap 4.0 and
Fitbit Charge 5. Further, we plan to conduct a large clinical trial to evaluate the performance of the Strength Band
Platform in real-world settings. Successful completion of this project will confirm the utility of OpiAID’s Strength
Band Platform for detecting relapse and withdrawal, and for enhancing clinicians’ ability to deliver quality,
sustainable care for patients with opioid dependency.",  ,,,,DAVID  REESER,,(484) 824-2248,david@opiaid.tech,,  ,

A sepsis patient’s risk of death has been demonstrated to increase by 4-7% per hour, where timely administration of appropriate antibiotics is expected to improve patient survival. Unfortunately, the standard of care approach for determining antibiotic susceptibility requires overnight culturing that can take a day or more. Currently, broad spectrum antibiotics are administered within the first hour of treatment with the hope that the pathogen will be susceptible, while waiting for antibiotic susceptibility results. The growing landscape of antibiotic resistance severely undermines the efficacy of the standard approach, as many pathogens are increasingly resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics. This project seeks to advance development of a novel optical approach for determining antibiotic susceptibility results within 1 hour to support the use of appropriate antibiotics, which has significant potential to improve patient mortality outcomes and reduce hospitalization costs._x000D_

Increased antibiotic resistance, and the increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are serious threats in view of the decreased pipeline of antibiotics. Solution: To fight CAUTIs, WynnVision LLC is developing a new approach by introducing a robust surface component for silicone Foley catheters that reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. With discovery of “WynnGard- 1” silicone in 2010, WynnVision redirected research activities during Phase II. Patented WynnGard-1 technology is novel compared to prior technologies that leach heavy metals or antimicrobials. With no depletion of a leached agent, WynnGard-1 has the potential for long term antimicrobial effectiveness. Challenge: A response from FDA to a WynnVision Pre-Request For Designation in December 2021 posed questions that require experimental studies concerning safety and efficacy. This Phase IIB proposal addresses FDA concerns that are embodied in Specific Aims. Aim 1. Demonstrate negligible or undetectable leaching from WynnGard-1 silicone with in vitro studies exceeding the maximum timeframe of patient use; Aim 2. Demonstrate reduction of bacterial colonization in media comparable to human urine; Aim 3. Animal studies to evaluate antimicrobial efficacy and biocompatibility; Aim 4. Establish a pathway to partnership for licensing and manufacturing. WynnVision is confident in providing information to FDA that will merit the designation “device” for WynnGard-1 silicone by FDA Office of Combination Products and requirements for approval of a 510(k) application to the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). The proposed Phase IIB research and FDA actions will de-risk the technology and make WynnGard-1 silicone attractive for commercialization. Impact: Low cost WynnGard-1 silicone will make this CAUTI-fighting technology widely available for all.",  ,,,,OLGA  ZOLOTARSKAYA,,3023682064,ozolotarskaya@wynnvision.com,,  ,

(NOWS) and associated hospital costs have dramatically increased in the past decade, with an American child
is born suffering from NOWS every 15 minutes. The ongoing opioid epidemic is further worsened by the COVID-
19 pandemic. Despite medication treatment for OUD with buprenorphine or methadone, the pregnant women
continue to be at high risk for early relapse, polysubstance use, overdose, depression, poor outcomes, and
associated high costs of longer hospital stays, and their significant negative long-term effects in women and their
children. Maternal depression and anxiety increase the risks for OUD, maternal relapse and NOWS. Children
with NOWS also experience poor long-term neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes. Genetic factors
influence opioid-related adverse events and outcomes including OUD and NOWS. The current clinical practices
for OUD treatment in pregnant women and NOWS do not include proactive risk prediction and prevention. There
is no comprehensive and polygenetic clinically adoptable risk prediction tool to proactively identify risks for
maternal relapse, NOWS and costly care. There is an urgent and unmet clinical need for a reliable technology
to proactively predict maternal relapse, NOWS, and improve the safety of pregnant women with OUD and their
children. We have shown that opioid related poor clinical outcomes vary significantly based on underlying genetic
predisposition. Single gene variations are independently associated with OUD, NOWS and inter-individual
variations in responses to buprenorphine, methadone and morphine, the commonly used opioids to treat OUD
in pregnant women and NOWS in infants. OpalGenix will build on our extensive prior prospective studies of
genetic and clinical predictors of opioid-related adverse outcomes to develop and commercialize a transformative
device, OpalGenix’s Genotype-guided Physician Support for Opioids, GPS-OpioidTM. GPS-Opioid will be a
510(k) cleared predictive analytic software as a medical device consisting of polygenetic, clinical risk factors and
electronic health record-integrated intelligent analytics to provide personalized risk analysis to proactively predict
risk for OUD-related risks including maternal relapse and NOWS with high accuracy (rt80%) to enable
personalized interventions, significantly improve clinical outcomes while reducing costs of care. In this Phase I
proposal, OpalGenix will build on these studies to develop and validate GPS Opioid as a 510(k) cleared algorithm
(medical device) that innovatively integrates polygenetic and clinical risks (e.g., maternal depression) to
proactively predict personalized risk for maternal relapse and NOWS. We will leverage our team’s expertise with
opioid pharmacogenomics, maternal OUD, NOWS, combinatorial risk predictive algorithms and
commercialization to reduce OUD related burden in pregnant women and their children. Completion of this Phase
I program will demonstrate value for GPS Opioid to improve clinical and economic outcomes, support an FDA

The goal is to confirm that the use of deep learning to provide these girls with a dynamic career exploration roadmap can successfully counter the common societal forces that negatively impact their pursuit of innate interests and development of the skills necessary for careers as entrepreneurs, scientists, technologists, and engineers. It is hypothesized that early identification of these innate interests preempts identity stereotypes. To combat confirmation bias that girls aren’t good at the fundamental skills needed for these careers, machine learning and AI-enabled data aggregation is used to correlate these innate traits with resources that foster associated job skills, offer opportunities and challenges that are suitable to the user, and provide opportunities to connect with successful role models to address the lack of representation of women in these areas.

There is an unmet need for a herpes simplex virus (HSV) vaccine. We propose to
develop a live-attenuated HSV-2 vaccine based on our R2 technology platform. R2
vaccines show unprecedented safety and efficacy in animal models, and offer
antigenicity superior to subunit/mRNA and single-round vaccine designs. R2 vaccines
are also the first live-attenuated alphaherpesvirus vaccines that lack neuroinvasive
potential, and thereby are incapable of establishing life-long infections in the nervous
system. In phase I of this fast-track STTR application, we propose to: (i) produce a HSV-
2 self-excising infectious clone of a low-passage clinical isolate, (ii) use the clone to
produce a HSV-2 R2 recombinant, and (iii) characterize the R2 vaccine in culture side by
side with our existing HSV-1 R2 vaccine candidate. In phase II, the HSV-2 R2 vaccine
will be tested for safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy in mice and guinea pigs. This work
will provide the foundation to advance product development to clinical trials.",  ,,,,GREGORY A SMITH,,(312) 503-3745,g_smith3@me.com,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,  ,

Recent epidemiologic models indicate that 1 in 279 people may be carriers of one of the most common HCS, and advances in genetic testing continue to identify new inherited mutations. Individuals with an HCS (Previvors) have up to an 80% lifetime risk of developing cancer and are at an increased risk of developing multiple primary cancers during their lifetime, often with onset at an early age. Previvors face multiple forms of adversity, including a multitude of annual cancer screenings and the uncertainty of not only their own health but the health of affected family members. Previvors also regularly experience “scanxiety” while anticipating, undergoing, and awaiting the results of screenings. While interventions to promote resilience among Previvors would address an important unmet public health need, existing solutions have a number of gaps that limit effectiveness, widespread dissemination, and applicability to Previvors.  The proposed research will employ a participatory design approach to create and examine the acceptability and preliminary effects of PREcharge, a resilience-boosting solution specifically designed for Previvors and delivered primarily via bi-directional text messaging. PREcharge will use proven approaches to behavior change tailoring to increase resilience by promoting a positive mindset, strong social connections, and a deep sense of meaning and purpose while also proactively addressing scanxiety. The design and development of PREcharge will be informed by extensive and ongoing end-user input from 10 Previvor advisors as well as 6 experts in this area. One hundred and twenty-nine Previvors will be recruited for a 30-day pilot test. Phase I milestones will include: 1) acceptability of the program, as evidenced by overall mean ratings of at least 4 out of 5 on a widely used acceptability measure and obtaining 75% endorsement that users would recommend the program to a fellow Previvor; (2) engagement as evidenced by continued receipt of text messages and one or more interactions with the online tools by at least 70% of participants; and (3) benefit from the program, evidenced by statistically significant pre-post improvement on the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale. Pilot participants who fail to sustain engagement will be asked to provide feedback on how PREcharge could be improved. The data from this pilot test will lay the foundation for the further development of tailored text- messaging solutions to improve resilience outcomes among the expanding population of Previvors. This type of easily disseminable, potentially cost-effective, and highly tailored solution would overcome the limitations of existing interventions and provide a framework for messaging on other key behaviors (e.g., health care provider communication) in the future.",  ,,,,KERRY  EVERS,,4013602985,kevers@prochange.com,,  ,

The potential societal impact of this technology is to provide a method to screen individuals quickly (under a minute) for the presence of infections. Screening at ports of entry and in appropriate community settings will minimize disease transmission and allow for the quick identification and treatment of any infected individuals at US borders.

_x000D_
The project seeks to determine the identity and order of the genetic building blocks, the nucleotide bases, comprising any genomic sequences present in a sample solution. This sequencing will be done by examining the ability of each base in the sequence to modify a tunneling current as it is passed by electrophoresis across two very closely spaced tunneling electrodes. Tunneling is a well-known quantum mechanical effect, and it is quite sensitive to the electrical configuration of the object (here a given specific nucleotide base) present between its electrodes. Experiments with this technology to date have been unsuccessful because genetic sequences have not been able to be moved slowly enough across the tunneling electrodes for their bases to be distinguished. The studies here will overcome this problem by modifications of the geometry and solution conditions of the electrophoresis and possibly with improved methods of tunneling current detection. The data obtained through the application of this technology is expected to enhance the current understanding of nucleotide base chemistry. The solution may permit the detection of nucleotide base modifications of potential biological and medical importance._x000D_

The resulting rich datasets enable the construction of true “digital twins” of forests and open the door for higher fidelity modeling of forest growth trajectories. This information is useful both for timber firms seeking to maximize the potential of their assets and environmental groups projecting how changes today could impact a forest’s performance as a carbon-sink over the long term.

The key technological innovations explored in this STTR Phase I project are in constructing the most high-fidelity forest model (digital twin) by combining disparate information sources, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Light detecting and ranging (LiDAR) and camera sensors on backpacks provide high-quality inventory metrics nearly 1000 times faster than manual measurements, but still require someone in the forest to wear the backpack. Satellite imagery scales almost instantly to entire forests and also through time with historical data but is limited by the top-down nature of satellites and the resolution they offer, especially when historical and free data sources are considered. Drone-based imagery sits in-between, with advantages and disadvantages of both. In practice, combining information sources that measure in such different ways can be very difficult. In this project, the team explores how to express LiDAR-based metrics to best associate them with top-down imagery from satellites and drones. From these associations, one can then build powerful machine learning models and specialize them to individual forests. This ability may enable the company to provide forest inventories and forest management recommendations to timber companies at any scale: with satellite imagery only or with a combination of backpack-LiDAR and satellite for the highest accuracy over the entire forest._x000D_

This proposal responds directly to the PAR-21-225 Novel Tools and Devices for Animal Research Facilities
and to Support Care of Animal Models. While it is standard practice to continuously monitor the health of
human patients following a major surgery, this is typically not the case for monitoring recovery in rodent pre-
clinical research. For example, it is common practice that rats and mice are provided an hour of post-surgical
supervision and then returned to their home cage and colony room with no follow-up until the following day.
Thus, animals can go un-monitored for more than 10 to 12 hours following a major surgery. Unmonitored
animals can suffer from post-surgical complications which may result in undue animal suffering, add
unnecessary variability to ongoing experiments, or reduce reproducibility within and among research groups.
Studies involving new procedures, surgical techniques or new personnel have seen very high mortality rates
(50% - 90%). While the monetary cost of the loss of a rat or mouse is low, the time invested to train the animal
or to build the implant (e.g., electrode array) can be very high. We propose a wireless and automated in-cage
monitoring and alerting system that incorporates multiple environmental sensors, a thermal camera, and
advanced machine learning (ML) software to identify aberrant post-surgical behavior (e.g., hunched posture),
fluctuations in body temperature, and unforeseen environmental conditions (e.g., changes in within-cage
temperature, humidity, light, and noise) that could affect animal welfare and survival. By identifying typically
unobserved changes in the animal and the in-cage environment, this device could improve reproducibility of
research by alerting researchers via email or text notifications following unplanned variations in conditions. The
proposed final system will be low-power, wireless and can be mounted on any standard rodent home cage. It
utilizes a thermal-imaging camera combined with ML based anomaly detection to identify changes in behavior
(e.g., changes in movement, body temperature, and posture) and environmental conditions. This system will
be developed through close collaboration with veterinary professionals and researchers and the machine
learning models trained on thermal imaging video data from cohorts of rats and mice under various conditions
so that it can identify behaviors associated with acute pain, distress, and health complications. This system has
the potential to improve the wellbeing and survival of laboratory rodents as well as providing researchers with
important behavioral and environmental data that can be monitored and stabilized to improve the
reproducibility of ongoing experiments.",  ,,,,PAUL  GIBSON,,(612) 470-9532,paul@audynamics.com,,  ,

The goal of the project proposed is to develop a gas chromatography and differential mobility spectrometry
(GC/DMS) molecular identification library for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using a deep neural network
approach. Vox Biomedical scientists will test the hypothesis that a novel, multi-task neural network architecture
can predict characteristics of an previously unseen analyte from its GC/DMS spectrum.
Vox Biomedical is in the process of commercializing the GC/DMS based microAnalyzer instrument, developed
at DRAPER, for detecting the presence of psychoactive drugs and disease through exhaled breath analysis.
While drug detection consists of measuring the concentrations in the exhaled breath of compounds whose
identity is well known (such as psychoactive opioids and cannabinoids), exhaled breath disease detection is
focused on characterization of a particular disease’s exhaled volatile organic compound signature. Volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) are byproducts of cellular metabolism that travel from cells throughout the body to
the lungs, where they are efficiently exhaled in the breath. VOCs have become of interest as biomarkers of
metabolic diseases such as cancer, kidney disease and diabetes. The current generation of exhaled breath VOC
based disease detection methods rely on gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS), which, while
highly sensitive, is a complex analytical modality that is expensive, slow, and must be operated by skilled
professionals.
The microAnalyzer instrument’s inherent portability, ease of use, and ability to obtain results at the point-of-
measurements make it an ideal instrument for breath-based disease detection. However, the currently a
GC/DMS peak can only be identified through characterization of a chemical standard or by performing
confirmatory GC/MS analysis using a similar sample. This makes biomarker discovery a resource and time
intensive process. The creation of a VOC chemical identity library, as would result from successful completion
of the proposed project, will allow the identity of samples introduced to the microAnalyzer instrument to be
predicted without the need for confirmatory standard characterization or GC/MS work. This will make biomarker
discovery for disease a less resource intensive process expediting the discovery and confirmation of biomarkers
for early-stage disease detection, ultimately saving lives.",  ,,,,JACOB  GOLDE,,(518) 321-5492,golde@voxbiomedical.com,,  ,

The real-time and guided process gathers information directly from the web browsers, handling traditional and unresolved problems with test automation such as software test design, automation, coverage, and maintenance. The AI solution will make SQA highly efficient by performing two major tasks: simulating real-time users' exploration of web applications and identifying unexpected behaviors. The architecture enables AI agents to self-learn and interact with the application, improving on each observation. The AI learning cycle implements thorough communication within the system as it communicates requests to apply specific actions based on its own knowledge analyzing the resulting effect. Phase I research proved that the architecture can be upgraded to a commercial version, providing value to customers looking to improve software quality in their products and go to market faster.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic disease in which the small bile ducts in the liver become injured
and inflamed and eventually destroyed. When bile ducts are depleted, the resulting bile build up results in liver
damage, leading to scarring, cirrhosis, and eventually liver failure. Among the common early symptoms of PBC
is itchy skin (pruritus), tiredness, abdominal pain, low appetite, weight loss and arthritis. This chronic
cholestatic liver disease predominantly affects women in their fourth and sixth decades. Currently therapeutic
options to treat PBC are limited and much of the pharmacotherapy is restricted to management of disease
symptomology.Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) acts as a potent signaling molecule with wide-ranging effects on many
different target tissues, and is implicated as a mitogen acting mainly through LPAR1 in the development of
fibrosis in various organs. LPAR1 is also implicated in the development of arthritis. Many of these observed
effects appear to involve LPAR1 activation and modulation of inflammatory responses through numerous
signaling molecules including TNFα, IFNγ, IL-17, CTGF and TGFβ. IFNγ and IL-17 are signaling molecules
implicated in the development of PBC. Pruritus is a serious symptom associated with PBC which has been
linked to Autotaxin, the enzyme responsible for plasma LPA production. LPA may act on neurons through its
receptors of which LPAR1 is the principal receptor expressed. Thus, LPAR1 may represent a key locus in the
development of both pathologic inflammation and serious quality of life symptoms.Epigen has identified several classes of potent and selective LPAR1 antagonists from which an initial
lead compound EPGN696 and backup EPGN2154 have demonstrated pre-clinical efficacy in other disease
models. These compounds do not show cholestatic risk in human cellular hepato-toxicity models compared to
a clinical compound BMS-986020 which has been withdrawn. We propose to profile the two LPAR1
antagonists for utility in PBC for their ability to modulate key inflammatory signaling molecules IFNγ and IL-17
and itch responses in pre-clinical models.Completion of lead profiling will result in selection of a single lead that will be evaluated in a pre-clinical
model of PBC, conducted at University of California Davis. These studies will determine the feasibility of
developing a LPAR1 antagonist for treatment of PBC.",  ,,,,FABIO C TUCCI,,(858) 657-0918,ftucci@epigenbiosciences.com,,  ,

The technological advancement addresses a fundamental issue that limits conventional bio-fermentation, which is that producing cells suffer limited health and viability in exchange for higher yields. In this proposal, genetic tools will be used to divide the labor of cell reproduction and product synthesis into two different cell types, called stem cells and factory cells. As older factory cells become exhausted, productivity is maintained by new factory cells, which are born from the stem cell population. The approach may be particularly well suited to biofuels and other molecules that are difficult to produce in large quantities by conventional bio-fermentation because the product is toxic to the cells that make it. It could be applied toward increasing the profitability of existing bio-processes and also for bringing new products to market, which are currently too difficult to produce. In this project, the team seeks to demonstrate the benefits of producing a fuel (limonene) and a dairy enzyme (chymosin), as proof of its application in biofuel and agricultural sectors. Broad industrial implementation will advance bio-manufacturing toward the ‘green’ revolution, contributing to the development of cleaner industries and decreasing US and global reliance on fossil fuels._x000D_
_x000D_
This project aims to solve two major limitations of microbial fermentation processes: metabolic exhaustion and genetic drift. These are nearly universal problems in the industry. Highly producing cells can become inactive due to the lack of metabolic resources, cytotoxic effects of products, and mutations that break the biosynthetic pathway. In this project, Microbial Stem Cell Technology (MiST) uncouples growth and production by establishing a multicellular system. One cell type is dedicated to product synthesis (factory cells), while another (stem cells) is responsible for cell division and the generation of new factory cells. As older factory cells lose productivity, the bioreactor is continuously replenished with new factory cells, derived from the stem cell population. By maintaining an active factory cell population, MiST-supported cultures are expected to exhibit increased production longevity and higher overall yield than conventional bio-fermentations. This project aims to validate the technology in E. coli engineered to produce limonene, a precursor for biodiesel and other useful chemicals. In the factory cells, T7RNAP will drive high-level expression of a suite of biosynthetic enzymes. Since limonene has a cytotoxic effect on producing cells, MiST-supported factory cell replenishment is expected to increase productivity by more than 2-fold compared to the conventional limonene-producing strains._x000D_

kidney diseases. Endoscopes have typically been reusable and are cleaned with high level disinfection (HLD)
between patients. Publications and reports in recent years have shown that endoscopes are not sufficiently
cleaned between patients, resulting in unacceptable levels of infection transmission among patients and even
patient deaths. This has become a particular concern among complex endoscopes such as duodenoscopes,
however the risk of infection transmission is not unique and extends across all flexible endoscopes including
duodenoscopes, bronchoscopes, gastroscopes, ureteroscopes, and colonoscopes. Disposable endoscopes
have been developed to address sterility but these usually offer inferior performance (including manipulability
as well as image quality) compared to existing reusable endoscopes which has impeded clinician adoption.Elements Endoscopy is taking a novel approach to solve this problem by developing a modular flexible
endoscopy system that lightly roboticizes the endoscope to remove infection risk, improve performance and
reduce per procedure cost. The breakthrough is separating the handle from the flexible portion of the
endoscope, allowing the flexible portion to become single use and be discarded after every use, eliminating
patient to patient contamination risk. The reusable handle houses actuators that connect to pull wires in the
separable flexible portion of the endoscope. Software will be used to enhance device handling performance
and closely match the behavior of existing reusable endoscopes that are preferred by clinicians. Our design
addresses the issue of contamination while offering enhanced performance at a lower per procedure cost.In this proposal, we will refine our knowledge of existing endoscope performance, iterate our design for
both a duodenoscope and a colonoscope body, and confirm that we can match the mechanical handling
performance of the preferred reusable devices now in use. Mechanical performance will be tested in benchtop
experiments and with advanced device prototypes tested in relevant phantom models by experienced
physicians to assess usability. Successful completion of this work will result in working duodenoscope and
colonoscope prototypes, demonstrating the abilities of our novel endoscope platform. In the future these
prototypes will be refined and the platform expanded to provide a solution to the issue of contaminated
endoscopes without sacrificing performance or increasing cost to the customer.",  ,,,,DWIGHT  MEGLAN,,(781) 320-9601,dmeglan@gmail.com,,  ,

Many countries, including the US, have seen a sharp increase in the incidence of STIs over the past half-decade, and especially since 2020. Many cases go undiagnosed and untreated, and 30% of patients may never get treatment after testing positive. Some of these STIs have the potential to cause serious health problems, including infertility, especially if not diagnosed and treated early. Stigma, privacy, and confidentiality issues make STIs optimal areas for POC tests at healthcare facilities, as they can reduce loss to follow-up, increase patient and partner treatment rates, and avoid the use of unnecessary antibiotic treatment. The company has developed a Molecular Point of Care platform, the AmplifiDxTM DX-1000, which is capable of rapid, molecular testing using direct swabs as the sample type. The system has five optical channels, allowing detection of up to 4 infectious targets plus an internal control. The DX-1000 is differentiated and well-suited for the infectious disease testing market. The chemistry is multiplexed and sensitive, yet simple, allowing for a miniaturized product that will be attractive in the point-of-care space. The workflow is easy - one-step, swab to answer - and does not require complex mixing of reagents or handling of multiple stages of the process. Lab- quality results will be delivers in as little as 30 minutes for COVID-19. 20 minutes are possible for DNA parameters as the number of assay steps can be less. The sleek cartridge and instrument are designed for low- cost manufacturing. AmplifiDx is poised to submit a first Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the FDA for a COVID-19 diagnostic, which is the basis for the proposed assay for STIs and relevant resistance markers. We propose the development of an assay which will detect Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhea (NG), as well as mutations associated with antibiotic resistance or susceptibility in NG. We also propose the development of a urine collection device that fits easily in to the existing workflow, to give doctors the choice of another sample type. This assay, which will be used with urogenital swabs or urine samples on the DX-1000 device and cartridge, will provide quick, actionable diagnosis for CT and NG at point of care, as well as guiding treatment decisions and promoting antibiotic stewardship by identifying antibiotic-related mutations.",  ,,,,SHOULIAN  DONG,,4088023465,shoulian@amplifidx.com,,  ,

In acquired or inherited blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease (SCD), these two interrelated properties are pathologically altered. SCD is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in its afflicted populations. In SCD, RBCs undergo radical morphological and structural transformations leading to decreased deformability and increased adhesiveness, which further trigger vascular complications and a number of comorbidities including painful crises, stroke, acute chest syndrome, and organ failure. OcclusionChip is a novel standardized in vitro microfluidic assay to measure microvascular occlusion mediated by RBCs in a wide range of clinical conditions. The unique design embodies the two key features of the capillary bed: a gradient of microcapillary networks and side passageways mimicking the arteriovenous anastomoses. Occlusion Index, measured by the OcclusionChip assay, may serve as a new standard parameter to evaluate the clinical efficacy of treatments improving red blood cell adhesion and deformability, such as hemoglobin modifying drugs, anti-sickling agents, and emerging genetic therapies. The objective of this STTR Phase I/II Fast-Track project is to translate and commercialize novel OcclusionChip microfluidic technology as a standardized and validated companion diagnostic assay for SCD. In Phase I, we propose to streamline the manufacturing process with a third-party manufacturer and establish a quality control strategy. In Phase II, we propose to contract manufacture a large number of devices (1000), establish analytical validation and clinical validation relative to conventional, targeted, or curative therapies in SCD. Our goal is to establish the manufacturability, analytical validation, and clinical utility of the OcclusionChip in providing comprehensive functional characterization of red cell biorheological properties and assessment of patient-specific response to emerging targeted and curative therapies in SCD.

as 16% of all youth under age 18 and often resulting in serious consequences such as criminal involvement,
health problems, and suicide. Given that adolescent SA is associated with high rates of comorbidity with
mental health (MH) problems and increased suicide risk, integrated SA-MH treatment involving cognitive-
behavioral and family therapy-based approaches, as well as early intervention, is critical. Yet few adolescents
receive any treatment for SA, and unmet needs for services are likely to increase following COVID-19-related
stressors, which disproportionately affected Black, Indigenous, and other youth of color. Developing culturally-
appropriate mobile app technology to effectively address adolescent SA, MH symptoms, and suicide risk,
delivering it in novel universal settings, and using direct-to-consumer and family peer support specialist
techniques could potentially have a large-scale and highly cost-effective public health impact.iKinnect is a paired mobile app platform that supports parents (in delivering) and youth (in receiving)
evidence-based practices to reduce youth problem behaviors. Based on Multisystemic Therapy principles,
iKinnect1.0 was originally designed to help youth with serious conduct problems. Results from a randomized
controlled trial (RCT; N=72) demonstrated its efficacy in reducing externalizing behaviors and improving
parenting effectiveness in youth with serious conduct disorder. iKinnect is currently being adapted for more
severely disordered suicidal youth involved in the juvenile justice system as well as their parents. We now seek
to significantly adapt iKinnect for use with a general population of teens with problematic substance use and
their parents to reduce SA, its harmful effects, opioid overdoses, and progression to substance use disorders,
as well as other behavioral health problems that are exacerbated by SA and/or interfere with SA treatment.This 34-month fast track seeks to address SA and co-occurring MH problems in teens by significantly
adapting iKinnect to deliver evidence-based SA and MH interventions to general-population youth engaging in
SA. We will pursue regulatory pathways for iKinnect-SA as a mobile medical device to achieve Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approval by the project’s end to pave the way for successful Phase III commercialization.

This project also has significant commercial potential. By delivering a lower-carbon product at lower cost than the current technology, the proposed innovation has the potential to become the de facto standard for manufacturing this commodity chemical. Annual licensing and ancillary revenue from a single plant is estimated at $30 million, and at 70-80% market share, typical for the dominant process, annual revenue could grow to over $1.5 billion.

_x000D_
This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop a light-driven chemical technology that enables the use of CO2 as a raw material in large scale chemical production of terephthalic acid. This project abates CO2 emissions by converting CO2, captured from point sources such as industrial flue stacks or direct air capture, to useful chemical and consumer products. Carbon dioxide is a stable compound and is typically unreactive and therefore incompatible with traditional heat-driven processes. The proposed project will help mature the technology of CO2 activation by photocatalysis, which has been shown to be effective in inducing CO2 reactivity. The first step is to demonstrate the feasibility of using CO2 to produce the target chemical at bench scale. Next, the reaction performance will be optimized using high-throughput experimentation techniques. Finally, the process will be scaled up in a photo flow photoreactor. In this part of the project, engineering scale up issues will be addressed as a precursor to realizing a production plant._x000D_

For cancers alone, over 30 million people undergo tissue biopsies annually in the US. While surgery currently represents the best standard of care treatment to cure invasive cancers, its success depends on timely excision of the tumor before it can spread. This is especially true for the removal of skin cancers, more common in the populace than all other malignancies combined, with Mohs surgery deemed the best treatment of choice for its high skin cancer cure rates. However, this procedure requires the repeated histopathological evaluation of patient tissue samples to confirmation of cancerous or non-cancerous tissue. This time-consuming step requires freezing, slicing, and preserving the tissue between microscope slides to take an image, adding 2-3 hours to surgical times. It increases operative times and the risk of postoperative complications including skin infections, bleeding or hematoma, wound dehiscence (disruption of recently repaired wounds), tissue necrosis, and pain. The process is also expensive, requiring ~$70k of equipment to set up, and pricy reagents and highly trained staff to maintain. There is an unmet need in the market for a cost-effective digital pathology solution to rapidly produce high-quality images. SurgiVance is developing a confocal-based Surgical Pathology System (SPS) to non-invasively and rapidly image intact specimens with high resolution. The SPS system uses a novel, patented line-scanning, stage-scanning confocal microscope. The NIH Phase 1 funded prototype successfully images standard sized specimens (5 mm x 10 mm) in only 17 seconds, at 1.2 µm lateral resolution and 8.6 µm optical section thickness. In this Phase II project, SurgiVance has 3 specific aims: 1) Recreate the prototype SPS device in a partner facility, which will perform design and engineering work to miniaturize the device, reduce its complexity, and increase its durability for market use, 2) develop AI-based software to rapidly scan and map the surfaces of fresh samples resected directly from patients, and 3) clinically validate the superior performance of SPS created 3D digital images of fresh tissue samples in comparison to the standard-of-care histopathology in Mohs patients in benchmarks established by the SurgiVance FDA Q-Sub Class II, 510(k) pathway to meet beachhead market needs. This Phase II study will enable SurgiVance to shift the paradigm towards instant, digital 3D pathology, that when integrated with SurgiVance’s AI-based diagnostics, could enable robust, reproducible, and rapid automated diagnoses.",  ,,,,DANIEL S GAREAU,,2123278000,dgareau@rockefeller.edu,,  ,

PFAS chemicals are widely used in firefighting foams and consumer goods. However, they are incredibly recalcitrant environmental pollutants, highly toxic to humans, and very hard to destroy. Widespread contamination of soil, groundwater, and drinking water at sites near airports, military bases, and manufacturing sites is driving a global effort to remove and destroy PFAS toxins. PFAS are poorly broken down by incineration and they do not have a natural half-life. The environmental remediation industry needs effective technology for on-site, end-of-life destruction of PFAS. The technology being developed in this SBIR Phase II project is energy efficient, scalable, pairs with existing technologies, and can be deployed at-scale for the destruction of PFAS-rich wastes. _x000D_

This SBIR Phase II project seeks to reduce technical risks related to system corrosion and chemical consumption in the development and scale-up of the hydrothermal alkaline treatment (HALT) process for the destruction of PFAS. Hydrothermal processing has historically been plagued by challenges with corrosion and low component lifetimes, and/or has requiring the use of expensive alloys, replaceable system components, and/or elegant chemical corrosion prevention strategies. This said, hydrothermal processes are some of the most effective and efficient technologies for destroying hazardous wastes, such as PFAS. This project will focus on measuring and mitigating the material corrosion challenges to enable more widespread adoption of hydrothermal processes for waste disposal. Additionally, HALT processing requires the use of alkaline chemicals as process additives. In this project, by adopting chemical recycling strategies, the use of chemicals may be drastically reduced, improving overall unit economics and reducing the environmental footprint of HALT processing._x000D_

Altrumed LLC,The DOVE Device to Prevent Opioid Overdose Deaths: An Armband That Senses Overdose and Automatically Injects Naloxone,Department of Health and Human Services,National Institutes of Health,Phase I,STTR,R41DA056276,1R41DA056276-01,5/1/23,4/30/25,PA20-272,2020.0,,9/8/21,NIDA,2023.0,419832.0,J8F3W4SWZ944,118224650,N,N,N,1.0,,3401 Grays Ferry Ave Bldg 450 Ste 1067,,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania,19146-2701,"ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the wide availability of the antidote naloxone, fatal opioid overdoses still occur at a rate of ~50-70,000 / year in the US. The problem is that naloxone requires a bystander to find and diagnose the overdose, find someone who has naloxone, and then properly administer it. Unfortunately, if this does not occur within 5 minutes, the patient will suffer from brain damage, which is often considered the “hidden epidemic” underneath the opioid death epidemic. Additionally, ~52% of opioid overdose deaths occur when the patient is totally alone, without nearby bystanders around. To solve these problems, here we introduce the DOVE device, which is an armband that detects an opioid overdose via pulse oximetry and accelerometry, and then automatically injects an antidote. Our collaboration between industry and academia has already moved forward the DOVE technology significantly: We published a paper showing 76% of persons who use opioids (PWUOs) (n=97) expressed a strong desire for a device like DOVE, and showed a strong preference for an armband over many other device designs. We next preliminarily validated the other technical challenges of DOVE: we showed our sensor’s accuracy was high on healthy volunteers with induced hypoventilation; and our autoinjector injected reproducibly into bench-top models of skin/fat/muscle. Additionally we validated the market, reimbursement, sales channels, freedom-to-operate, and regulatory path. In this STTR grant, we will optimize & test the 3 major components of DOVE (harness, sensor, and injector): In Aim 1, we will optimize and validate the harness which keeps the device position on the deltoid muscle. We will do this with structured interviews and observations of PWUOs interacting with each of 6 harness prototypes. In Aim 2 we will test if the DOVE sensor can accurately detect hypoxemia in sleeping patients. Overdose events are relatively rare, so to increase the probability of detecting hypoxia using the DOVE’s pulse oximeter, we will apply 2 DOVE pulse-oximeter prototypes (a finger-ring, and one placed on the shoulder skin) to 20 obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients already undergoing sleep studies. We will compare the DOVE’s pulse oximeter and accelerometry traces vs. those of FDA-approved devices. Finally, in Aim 3 we will optimize the DOVE auto-injector to meet the size & shape constraints specified by PWUOs, and to accurately inject into fresh, cadaveric pigs.",  ,,,,JACOB  BRENNER,,6507997024,jacob.brenner@pennmedicine.upenn.edu,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,  ,

Epigenetic silencing of MGMT via promoter hypermethylation is found in ~50% of glioblastomas (GBMs), and in most lower grade gliomas with isocitrate dehydrogenase-1/2 (IDH1/2) mutations. MGMT is also silenced in other cancers, including up to 40% of colon cancers, 35% of small cell lung cancers, and 25% of non-small cell lung cancers. In cells that lack MGMT expression (termed MGMT-cells), TMZ-derived O6-methylguanine (O6MeG) lesions mispair with thymine, during DNA replication, due to altered hydrogen base pairing, leading to activation of the mismatch repair pathway (MMR). MMR attempts to repair these lesions by resecting the newly synthesized strand, but thymine once again is inserted opposite of O6MeG. This reinsertion again triggers MMR, leading to iterative “futile cycles” of DNA repair and ultimately apoptosis. Clinically, MGMT promoter demethylation is rare, whereas MMR mutations occur frequently as a dominant mechanism of resistance to TMZ in many tumor types. Because MGMT silencing is found in many cancers, DNA lesions that overcome the MMR resistance (while still being resolvable by MGMT, so as to maintain a therapeutic index (TI)) will have a broad impact. Furthermore, as this biomarker persists even in the treatment-refractory setting (i.e., in the context of MMR defects), we argue that loss of MGMT expression has not been fully exploited for therapeutic gain. Based on the findings presented above, we seek to develop a new class of agents discovered in the laboratory of Drs. Ranjit Bindra and Seth Herzon that generate O6MeG lesions  that are susceptible to MGMT removal (“MGMT dependent”) in healthy cells, but which can overcome MMR  resistance (“MMR independent”). To this end, Drs. Bindra and Herzon have co-founded KL50 Therapeutics, LLC, and their studies lead to the identification of KL50, a novel alkylation agent that is more active against MMR- cell lines than MMR+ cell lines, while retaining MGMT resolvability. This molecule demonstrates exquisite sensitivity  in MGMT-deficient cells independent of MMR status, with negligible activity in MGMT-proficient cells, and has a  TI approximately 30 times greater than TMZ. Building on these achievements, in this fast-track SBIR project, we  propose to conduct lead optimization to improve central nervous system (CNS) penetration, identify a collection  of small molecules with in vivo efficacy in mouse models of high-grade gliomas (HGG), and further develop these compounds for use in a Phase 1 clinical trial. These MGMT dependent–MMR independent alkylating agents are  anticipated to possess the positive attributes of TMZ, while circumventing the unavoidable MMR loss mediated  resistance mechanism and, thereby, have a major impact on the way we treat GBMs and other tumors lacking MGMT. These molecules could represent a paradigm shift in oncology by dramatically improving their therapeutic index. If successful, our approach will significantly increase the safety and efficacy of DNA alkylators and will expand their use for a broader range of recurrent gliomas and many other cancers.",  ,,,,GERALD F VOVIS,,2032728658,gfv@vovis.necoxmail.com,,  ,

Despite aggressive antithrombotic therapy, myocardial perfusion after PCI remains inadequate in many patients. Recurrent thrombosis and dose-limiting bleeding complications continue to occur in a significant number of patients. Attempts to further improve clinical outcomes have led to the development of more potent platelet P2Y12 inhibitors including prasugrel and ticagrelor, and direct factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban (not approved for PCI), but increase bleeding complications. Moreover, none of the current antithrombotics provide effective protection against coronary microvascular obstruction. This results in microinfarcts accompanied by inflammation, which is a determinant of patient prognosis, independent from infarct size. Clearly, the next milestones for acute AMI treatment are to break the link between antithrombotic potency and bleeding risk and to protect the myocardium and coronary microcirculation against reperfusion injury that causes chronic adverse left ventricle remodeling and heart failure.  APT402 is a novel therapeutic fusion protein of an optimized human apyrase and annexin V that provides antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and cardioprotective activities. We hypothesize that the fusion will target the antithrombotic effect to the site of coronary thrombosis and synergistically attenuate thrombosis and reperfusion injury with minimal bleeding risk. In a rabbit carotid artery electrical injury model, APT402 preferably bound to the injured site and to the thrombus. Treatment with clopidogrel, ticagrelor, low molecular weight heparin, or bivalirudin alone failed to fully prevent occlusion with significantly increased bleeding. In contrast, APT402 maintained 100% patency without increasing bleeding time, PT, or aPTT. Strikingly, APT402 more effectively attenuated arterial thrombosis than ticagrelor plus bivalirudin. In this direct Phase II SBIR application, we propose to determine whether acute treatment with APT402 more effectively protects microvascular circulation and improves heart function in a clinically relevant model of thrombogenic myocardial infarction, while reducing bleeding risks compared to ticagrelor plus heparin, the standard-of-care treatment during PCI in the contemporary era of radial access. We have also assembled an experienced drug development team and will advance critical activities necessary to enable IND filing.  Specific Aim 1. Using a porcine model of thrombogenic coronary microembolization, determine whether APT402 more effectively reduces coronary microvascular obstruction and improves LV function 60 days after reperfusion with less bleeding compared to ticagrelor plus heparin.  Specific Aim 2. Manufacture cGMP grade APT402.  Specific Aim 3. Evaluate nonclinical safety of APT402.  Successful completion of the proposed studies will strongly support IND filing and clinical trials to improve outcomes for millions of patients with acute myocardial infarction and other thrombotic diseases.",  ,,,,RIDONG  CHEN,,3123398455,rchen@apt-therapeutics.com,,  ,

There are as many as 1.5 M people with HCM in the US alone, 2/3 of whom have the obstructive form of the disease with over 50k remaining refractory to medical management and are candidates for septal reduction therapy (SRT). Despite this, only ~1,200 patients per year of the 50k currently indicated receive SRT, leaving the vast majority of the most severe patients untreated. The reason for is the highly invasive nature of existing SRTs that cause frequency cardiac rhythm abnormalities requiring implantation of a pacemaker or cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and have unacceptably high rates of peri- and post- procedural mortality (up to 10%). Additionally, many patients are unsuitable for existing SRT procedures due to existing co-morbidities and/or anatomical limitations. This Phase II SBIR proposes development of a novel treatment for oHCM by precisely targeting the source of the obstruction on the interventricular septum (IVS) using a novel high-intensity therapeutic ultrasound (HITU) catheter. Our approach takes a relatively safe, femoral venous approach to the right ventricle (RV) using existing delivery tools and knowhow within cardiac electrophysiology. Treatment focuses on delivery of HITU to selectively ablate the entire mid-myocardium of the IVS while sparing the cardiac conduction system on the sub-endocardium (His-Purkinje), thereby reducing risk of heart block requiring pacemaker or ICD insertion. This proposal builds upon the Phase I-equivalent work in acoustic physics, and pre-clinical proof of concept with a prototype catheter demonstrating that, by generating deep lesions in the mid-septum with a HITU, the IVS thickness can be reduced by approximately 30%. Based on catheter irrigation features and HITU’s natural focusing characteristics sparing the sub- endocardium, heart block can be avoided even in the setting of extensive ablation in this region. The aims of this proposal will focus on maturation of catheter design elements and manufacturing methods to make the prototype device suitable for clinical evaluation, verify the functionality and safety of the system to relevant international safety standards (particularly IEC 60601-2-62 standards), and validate the safety, efficacy, and durability of this therapy in acute and chronic (3-month) preclinical models via clinically accepted modalities (cardiac MRI, TTE, clinical pathology, gross pathology and histopathology). The information obtained in this grant will be used in direct support of early feasibility IDE submission with the FDA as part of a future phase of the grant. Commercialization of our system will bring lifesaving therapy to thousands of critically ill patients every year and eventually expand to treatment of HCM patients in earlier stages of the disease before long- standing obstructive hypertrophy resulted in irreversible health consequences.",  ,,,,HOWARD  LEVIN,,6077430355,hlevin@coridea.com,,  ,

It will establish industrial production methods (specifically high-precision injection molding) necessary to ensure consistent and controlled scale-up manufacturing of Tracer-QC analysis plates that are currently manufactured by non-salable, variable and costly machining process.  CRP Problem. Trace-Ability is focusing a lot of current effort on scaling up Tracer-QC kit production to the levels that can supply the entire PET industry with high-quality kits. However, there is one aspect where the current manufacturing technology is not scalable and carries quality risks. It needs to be replaced by a completely new technology in order to support the PET industry. Specifically, it is the manufacturing of the core Tracer-QC analysis plate in which all QC assessments take place. Current plates are made by cutting standard 384-well plates. Such process is not scalable. It has inherent plate-to-plate variability and a high risk of debris contaminating the wells required for precise optical analysis.  CRP Solution. Trace-Ability has developed a proposal together with Agilent Technologies, Inc. to manufacture analysis plates by injection molding. This project is designed to establish scalable production of analysis plates and re- validate all existing Tracer-QC assays in these plates.  Specific Aim 1: Scalable injection molding process for manufacturing high-quality analysis plates. The “high-quality” acceptance criteria are (a) well absorbance <0.065 AU in the range of 400-700 nm with a standard deviation (b) <0.003 AU in empty wells and (c) <1% in filled wells at 500 nm. Development will be performed by Agilent. Milestones: (a) Molded plates meet all acceptance criteria. (b) Finalized molding process is suitable for over 200,000 plates per year.  Specific Aim 2: Tracer-QC tests validated successfully in molded plates. Before the new plates can be included in Tracer-QC kits that can be used for release testing of FDG and other PET drugs, 8 assays that rely on the wells of the plate will require testing and validation: color, clarity, pH, Endotoxin, Kryptofix, acetonitrile, ethanol and radioactivity concentration. Proposed work will be carried out at Trace-Ability. Milestone: Validation results meet all ICH Q2 (R1) acceptance criteria for all assays.  This proposal is for technical assistance associated with manufacturing, including industrial production equipment and methods necessary to ensure consistent and controlled scale-up manufacturing according to recognized quality standards. Achievement of the above aims will put Trace-Ability in position to support all manufacturers of cancer PET drugs in their full capacity with a fully-automated QC solution. This will maximize the commercial potential of the Tracer-QC business that relies on recurring kit revenues from the growing install base. The impact in the field of Oncology will be manifested in increased availability of FDG and other cancer PET scans and facilitation of new tracer development. Such availability is currently limited by throughput and compliance issues in PET drug QC, which Tracer-QC has proven to address successfully, but needs scalable kit production to offer the enabling benefits to the entire industry.",  ,,,,ARKADIJ  ELIZAROV,,3109880463,elizarov@traceabilityinc.com,,  ,

Urine-based lateral flow assays (LFAs) are low-cost devices suitable for point-of-care testing, particularly in low-resource settings. However, many urine-based LFAs exhibit sensitivity levels well below diagnostic utility due to the low concentration of diagnostic biomarkers present in urine. This is the case with LFAs for tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics and is a major barrier to rapid TB testing and treatment in endemic areas. Mainstream clinical and laboratory tests for diagnosing active TB, including bacterial culture, sputum smear microscopy and nucleic acid amplification tests, present limitations in speed, sensitivity, accessibility, respectively. These tests also require sputum samples that present additional difficulty and exposure risks for healthcare staff during the collection procedure. To address this, we developed an osmotic processor that statically and spontaneously concentrates urinary biomarkers for use in LFAs. Urea and small molecules that can interfere with downstream assays are removed in the concentration process. Using human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) protein as a model analyte, we showed near 100-fold concentration of a 20 mL sample in an early prototype. By exploiting the principles of osmosis, recent prototypes developed by the company show promise in significantly reducing processing time to within 30 minutes. With its simplicity and flexibility, the device demonstrates a great potential to be interfaced with existing LFAs to enable highly sensitive detection of dilute target analytes in urine, while still retaining a diagnostic time suitable for point-of-care diagnostics. The project aims to validate molecule concentration quantitatively with mass spectrometry in newer prototypes, perform spike-and-recovery tests with simulated urine and lab-based LAM, and then test qualitatively with TB-positive clinical samples and LFAs. If awarded the Phase I SBIR grant, the team will hire another full time research scientist, register our device as a General Controls Device through the FDA, continue business collaborations with companies developing LFAs, research other applications of the device to process other biomarkers for diagnostic, disease monitoring and therapeutic purposes, and plan scale-up of device production for commercial distribution in preparation of Phase II.",  ,,,,JAMES  LAI,,4256237492,james.lai@truly-technologies.com,,  ,

The brain is a highly-specialized, finely-tuned organ that depends for its function on maintaining homeostasis
within narrowly-defined limits. This is achieved in large part by the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), which tightly
regulates what can and can’t get into the brain. Functionally, the BBB is the combined work of endothelial cells
(EC), pericytes and astrocytes, the latter two of which act on the EC to maintain an extensive network of tight
junctions, promote the expression of specialized transporters, and limit the rate of transcellular pinocytosis. This
lack of free transfer between blood and brain for non-lipophilic species severely limits the entry of many,
otherwise useful, small molecule drugs. For example, cisplatin (lt3% Brain/Plasma ratio), is effective in non-brain
tumors, but has poor penetrance and low efficacy against brain tumors such as glioma. Similarly, delivery of
immunotherapeutics such as bevacizumab (0.2%) and bi-specific antibodies is also limited, and much is still to
be understood regarding the delivery of immune cells to the brain, including CAR-Ts, NK cells, γδ T cells and
the patient’s own monocytes and lymphocytes. Finally, there are significant differences between mouse and
human physiology including in the immune system. Many drug developers are therefore turning to human cell-
based systems rather than mouse models. The primary goal of this Phase I SBIR application is to demonstrate
the feasibility of Aracari Biosciences’ proprietary technology to model appropriate drug and immunotherapeutic
delivery across the human BBB. Aracari’s patented core technology is a perfusable human vascular network
within a microfluidic device that fits in a convenient 96-well plate format. This technology has been successfully
developed into commercialized products including the vascularized micro-organ (VMOTM) and the vascularized
micro-tumor (VMTTM). Importantly, leukocytes can be perfused through the vessels and on stimulation they will
adhere and extravasate as they do in vivo. We have also developed a vascularized micro-brain (VMB), which is
the focus of this application. This incorporates a perfused neurovascular unit (NVU) comprised of human BBB
EC, pericytes and astrocytes, all embedded in a brain-mimicking extracellular matrix. The vessels show
upregulation of BBB transporters and junctional proteins, and greatly-reduced permeability compared to non-
NVU vessels. Tumor cells (glioma) can be added to model brain tumors (VMB-T) and the potential compromise

while currently only 7% of FDA-approved drugs in the United States target this class of protein. This is despite
the fact that there are many dozens of already identified metalloenzyme targets involved in virtually every
therapeutic area, including anti-inflammatory, antibiotics, antivirals, anticancer drugs, and more. This is in large
part because the already very difficult drug design requirement to maintain/increase the potency of an initial
ligand (drug-like molecule) while improving/maintaining its target selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties,
is made even harder by the complicated and often non-intuitive nature of metal-ligand and metal-protein
interactions. Accurate molecular modeling predictions of metalloenzyme-ligand binding affinities, then, would
be highly impactful in pharmaceutical industry drug research and development programs, because they would
allow RandD scientists to carry out computational experiments drastically reducing the number of expensive and
time-consuming bench experiments required to overcome the difficult metalloenzyme inhibitor design
challenges they face. However, currently available molecular modeling approaches are unable to make
predictions reliable enough to do this. Docking and scoring methods are able to determine, in many cases, the
pose of inhibitors in metalloenzyme active sites, but they cannot correctly rank candidate inhibitors in order of
binding affinity as they lack the required detail in their energy models. Recently, free energy-based methods have
advanced to the point of providing reliable binding affinity predictions for many non-metal protein-ligand series
and can, therefore, help speed ligand discovery efforts for these systems. They cannot provide good binding
affinities for metalloenzyme-ligand systems though, because to-date they are all entirely based on classical
forcefields, which fundamentally limits the accuracy of their descriptions of metal-ligand and metal-protein
interactions. This is due, in part, to lack of inclusion of important polarization and charge transfer effects, but it
is also because the complex electronic structure, which metals often exhibit, is intrinsically quantum mechanical.
This fast-track SBIR proposal will address this by developing a new and unique molecular modeling software
tool called Mzyme-QM-VM2, which will provide reliably accurate binding free energies for metalloenzyme-
inhibitor complexes by a novel combination of statistical mechanics and highly scalable quantum chemistry
methods. This software will be based on mining minima free energy calculation methodology and will be
developed as an extension of VeraChem's VM2 free energy software platform.",  ,,,,SIMON  WEBB,,(240) 686-0565,webbsim@verachem.com,,  ,

Nearly 4.4 million individuals are on community supervision in the United States, with the majority (about
80%) being supervised under probation.1 Justice involved persons (JIPs) have a 474% increased lifetime
experience with heroin, a 303% increased use of OxyContin in the last 12 months, and a 256% increased use in
pain medication in the last 12 months, compared to the general population.3 One important step in addressing
substance use and addiction is getting individuals engaged in the treatment process, as initiation and retention
rates are very low for substance use treatment among this population. Q2i successfully developed the
Probation/Parole And Reentry Coach Application (PARCA) technology, which includes a Justice Team (JT)
Dashboard connected to a mobile app designed for JIPs. The platform enables JIPs to set and manage their
personal goals while assisting them in addressing the social determinants of health (SDOH) in order to
facilitate and supplement the substance use treatment process. It provides a step-by-step guide and identifies
local services and resources that the JIPs can connect with to accomplish these goals. At the same time, it gives
the JT a dashboard that enables greater insight on how a JIP is managing their plan. This increased connection
and communication between the JT and the JIP is designed to improve the community supervision process. In
this Phase 1/Phase 2 Fast Track STTR application, Q2i’s PARCA platform will be refined and implemented in
Dallas and Hidalgo Counties to test its efficacy. The primary goal of Phase I is to enhance the PARCA
platform for JIP. The study team will accomplish this by recruiting three sets of 2 PPOs/Case Managers willing
to use PARCA with five of their clients who have used any opioids in the last 12 months (total JIPs = 30) for 2-
weeks. The team will conduct interviews with PPOs and their clients that will inform our user-centered design
iterations. Initial interviews will describe barriers and challenges to successful community supervision
including accessing MOUD treatment and how PARCA can be improved to address these challenges. Follow-
up interviews will describe feasibility (use of the PARCA platform features) and acceptability (engagement
with PARCA platform through user engagement logs) of using PARCA platform to locate and access MOUD
treatment. The overall goal of Phase II is to test the relative efficacy of supervision as usual (SAU) and
PARCA in helping JIPs under community supervision engage in substance use treatment process and reduce
subsequent involvement in criminal behavior. Using a stepped wedge effectiveness design, we will evaluate the
PARCA platform across probation/parole officers (PPOs) (N=60), probationers/parolees (N=600). PPOs will
be randomized in three clusters of 20 people to utilize PARCA. Lastly, we will assess the acceptability and
feasibility of PARCA platform by supervision officers and justice-involved persons (JIPs) and whether
PARCA improves the working alliance between supervisors and JIPs.",  ,,,,FAYE S TAXMAN,,(703) 993-8555,ftaxman@gmu.edu,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,  ,

LRTI affects patients more often in ICUs, especially patients with mechanical ventilators. Early initiation of short-course antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone in managing mechanically ventilated patients with LRTI. However, using the current clinical criteria, a diagnosis of LRTI is typically not made until an infection in the lower respiratory tract is well established. To address the current limitations, molecular diagnostic technologies such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based multiplex assays have been developed. However, they cannot distinguish between colonization and infection. Therefore, a more sophisticated diagnostic methodology is needed for LRTI diagnosis and management. Human exhaled air has great potential to address the current limitations in diagnosing LRTI. However, the lack of a suitable collection system for clinical use put a major barrier to exploring the medical potential of using human exhaled air. To address these limitations, Zeteo Tech renovated the capture mechanism and developed a novel collection system, BreathBiomicsTM, for biomolecules for human breath analysis. Specifically, we demonstrated that BreathBiomicsTM could be configured into mechanical ventilators for collecting biomolecules in the exhaled air from intubated patients in intensive care units. Most importantly, by characterizing these biomolecules using mass spectrometry, we identified truncated proteoforms, which are the products of activated proteases, and demonstrated that truncated proteoforms had the diagnostic potential for LRTI in a pilot study. Considering this evidence, we propose to determine whether truncated proteoforms in human exhaled air can be used as a noninvasive method for LRTI diagnosis and early prediction of LRTI in mechanically ventilated patients. Our work would largely assist decision-making for clinicians regarding antibiotic treatment and dramatically improve patients' clinical outcomes by limiting antibiotic requirements and minimizing harmful exposure to unnecessary antibiotic treatment.",  ,,,,DAPENG  CHEN,,4103509190,dapeng.chen@zeteotech.com,,  ,

critical roles in activating and destroying proteins during cell growth, development, cell signaling,
apoptosis, and autophagy. Misregulation, however, can lead to disease; for example, cancer
cells often secrete metalloproteases that degrade the extracellular matrix, permitting cancers
cells to metastasize and take root at various locations in the body. Proteases work by recogniz-
ing linear regions, typically 6 to 8 residues, in their substrates and hydrolyzing a peptide bond,
thereby fragmenting their substrate into N-terminal and C-terminal fragments. Understanding
the range of peptide sequences cleaved by a protease, termed the ""proteolysis signature"" or
""substrate profile"", has many scientific implications and practical benefits. One powerful method
for determining the proteolysis signature or substrate profile of a recombinant protease is
through the use of combinatorial peptide libraries. In this effort, there are two specific aims. In
Aim #1, we will develop an improved phage vector for protease site identification by allowing for
more efficient cleavage of recognized sequences, more even representation of amino acids,
and identification of longer recognition sequences (up to 10 AA).The vectors will carry the
kanamycin resistance gene and a second copy of gene III that is tagged at the N-terminus with
the AviTag and has the same cloning site cassette at three different locations. After the vectors
have been demonstrated to be suitable as substrates for two model proteases, oligonucleotides
will be ordered with a 10-mer region randomized with 19 trinucleotide phosphoramidites at equal
frequency encoding 19 amino acids (excluding cysteine) for cloning into each site and large (rt
1010) libraries created. The OmpT gene in the bacterial strain, XL1-Blue, will be knocked out by
homologous recombination to eliminate the loss of phage-displayed peptides in the libraries that
carry dibasic residues. In Aim #2, Tango will evaluate the utility of the new libraries with two
commercially available proteases, the human metalloprotease, ADAM15, and the Escherichia
coli protease, DegP. Virions will be captured on neutravidin-coated magnetic beads, released
with each protease, and the output will be sequenced by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS).
Nimble Therapeutics will then synthesize two million peptides on arrays, corresponding to 10 or
more copies of each peptide sequence discovered by NGS, along with systematic amino acid
replacements of any motifs identified among the selected peptides. The peptides will carry a
peptide tag at their C-termini, which binds to fluorescent streptavidin, and a PEG linker at their
N-termini to distance them it away from the array surface. Arrays will be incubated with the pro-
tease, incubated with fluorescent streptavidin, and scans will reveal which spots lose fluores-
cence due to proteolysis. To confirm that such peptides are true substrates for their respective
protease, Tango will order 20 synthetic peptides for each and determine the cleavage site by
mass spectrometry. Successful completion of the proposed experiments will create great value.
Tango will build proprietary phage libraries and refine a standard operating protocol (SOP) with
which it can determine the substrate profile for any client protease. A future Phase II SBIR appli-
cation would enable Tango to define the profile 50 human and pathogen proteases, which would
create licensing opportunities for the development of peptidomimetic inhibitors to treat human
disease and infection.",  ,,,,BRIAN K KAY,,(630) 337-0317,bkay@tangobio.com,,  ,

This is of major concern as safe and effective treatment options are lacking for this high-risk population. Anxiety in those with OUD is linked to earlier and more rapid progression of OUD, and high probability of co-use of other substances, particularly GABAA receptor positive modulators, such as benzodiazepines (BZDs). BZDs are currently the standard of care treatment for fast-acting relief for general anxiety and panic disorder. Although highly effective in the short-term, BZDs represent amajor, but often overlookedcontributorto the opioid overdose epidemic. BZDs are involved in an estimated 12,000 overdose fatalities each year in the US, largely due to the concomitant use with other CNS depressants, such as opioids. In fact, more than 90%of BZD overdose fatalities involve opioids and up to 30% opioid overdoses involve BZDs. Additionally, BZD prescription rates are directly linked to opioid overdose rates per state. With a lack of safe alternatives that can offer comparable efficacy, BZD market predictions indicate their use will remain steady or increase globally. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop safe and comparably effective alternatives to BZDs for those with OUD. We have discovered a novel series of promising synthetic GABAAR active molecules Our lead molecule, RU-EC2-118, is a partial GABAAR PAM with nanomolar potency at GABAAR subtypes and high oral bioavailability.

Project Summary/Abstract
Recent decades have been marked by a revolution in single-cell analytical techniques, instruments and
software tools that have markedly improved our understanding of biology. A high-profile example has been the
emergence of single-cell sequencing to move from bulk genomic and transcriptomic analysis to single-cell
resolution that reveals the heterogeneity of individual cells. Similar trends have been observed in protein
analysis, spatial transcriptomics, and other disciplines.
However, there remains a critical unmet need in understanding individual cellular function, movement,
interactions, and other measures of performance. The genesis of cells as living drugs requires the
development of technologies that can characterize the function and performance of massive numbers of cells
at single-cell resolution to support development of new therapies and clinical biomarkers. Unfortunately,
existing technologies are either not scalable, are cell-destructive and so cannot evaluate cells and their
interactions over time, or do not provide single-cell resolution.
CellChorus® evaluates the performance and interactions of thousands of individual cells by applying Time-
lapse Imaging Microscopy in Nanowell Grids (TIMING™) with neural network-based artificial intelligence (AI) to
identify, track, and characterize behaviors and interactions of disease cells together with T-cells and other
effector cells. The platform has been validated technically and commercially in an academic setting and an
early access laboratory, but this model does not scale.
We will develop and rigorously validate a Chronos™ instrument that delivers dynamic single-cell analysis
based on the TIMING platform and applying our existing AI software and algorithms. The Chronos instrument
will allow scientists, researchers, and manufacturing experts to apply dynamic single-cell analysis to catalyze
development and manufacture of novel therapies in infectious diseases, oncology, and other medical sciences.",  ,,,,LAURENCE J COOPER,,(713) 301-5041,ljncooper@cellchorus.com,,  ,

Endometriosis affects 6-10% of women of reproductive age, with prevalence of 20-50% in infertile women, and
71-87% of women with chronic pain. The incidence of adenomyosis is reported as 28.9 per 10,000 women.
Adenomyosis is detected in 27% of hysterectomy materials in benign gynecological surgery. It leads to
abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain, pelvic mass, and infertility. Uterine fibroids are the most common
benign tumors of the reproductive system found in 15–65% of women. Like adenomyosis, uterine fibrosis can
lead to complaints of vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, and infertility, depending on their location. Unfortunately,
there is often a delay in the diagnosis of such conditions. In patients aged 18–45 years, the average delay is
6.7 years. Early referral, identification of disease and treatment may mitigate pain, prevent disease
progression, and thus preserve fertility. Barriers to early diagnosis include the high cost of diagnosis and
presentation of confounding symptoms. Thus, a non-invasive tool to diagnose such conditions could facilitate
earlier intervention that could ultimately improve quality of life and preserve fertility. In the Phase I research, a
unique probe capable of tactile and ultrasound imaging will be designed (Aim 1) and its imaging performance
of endometriosis, adenomyosis, and uterine fibroids will be explored in a feasibility study with 30 patients (Aim
2). It will be a new device for stress-strain imaging of the targeted areas in the female pelvic floor and
recognition of targeted diseased conditions. Stress data will be provided by a 2D pressure (tactile) sensor array
and strain data, and anatomical images will be supplied by a high-definition ultrasound. This data combination
allows biomechanical mapping of the soft tissues in absolute scale. The scientific premise behind this
approach is that practically all soft tissue disease conditions change their viscoelastic properties. The proposed
approach is designed to shorten the time to diagnosis, improve accessibility, safety, convenience, and costs of
the diagnosis.",  ,,,,VLADIMIR  EGOROV,,(609) 883-0100,egorov@tactile-imaging.com,,  ,

current CEAS technology. BRI will develop and demonstrate an inexpensive, reusable Pre-concentration

leading CEAS technology capabilities for air quality monitoring opening many new applications.GCS-CEAS will be suitable for mobile applications with a time response comparable to or better than other
gas analyzers (1-2 minutes). Extreme weather events are increasing instances of cascading technological
disasters, e.g., hurricanes damage infrastructure, causing chemical releases, and thus, exposure. GCS-CEAS
addresses the resulting VOHs released and can be expanded to include any gas that can be measured by gas
chromatography. Thus, GCS-CEAS supports disaster response as a reliable, accurate sensor that detects an
extensive range of toxic gases for exposure assessment for first responders and the community.The GCS-CEAS uses fast (0.1-2 s time response) analysis by the CEAS of CH4 to guide GCS-CEAS data
collection or PSM collection for later analysis. GCS-CEAS can be adapted easily to other VOHs of interest.
Envisioned mobile applications are for cars, a 4WD vehicles, or small ATVs. There are direct health
applications: exposure, breath analysis, diagnostics, or monitoring exhaled anesthetic. GCS-CEAS will be
commercially accessible, requiring minimal technical expertise, maintenance, and calibration.Fusion of mobile real-time, focused speciation by GCS-CEAS with archival full speciation will transform
source monitoring. GCS-CEAS enables in-plume sample collection that stationary monitors can easily miss or
misinterpret to estimate exposure. Mobile data are snapshot data that removes the large uncertainty in
stationary datasets wherein transport processes and emission unsteadiness become confounded.We demonstrate field application of GCS-CEAS using remote PSM sample collection downwind of the
Carson Refinery for complete analysis by the bench top system. Tasks involve developing and validating
optimization modules to meet target time response, accuracy, selectivity, and detection limits and accounting
for H2 balance effects on CEAS calibration. Target GCS-CEAS accuracy is 5%. PSM target detection limits are
sub-25 ppt at 1-3 minute time response for BTEX and alkanes, similar to fluorescence analyzer time-scales,

Liver fibrosis is a major health problem that causes morbidity and mortality in the affected patient population. Liver fibrosis occurs in various pathologies including chronic alcohol exposure, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that can lead to non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and viral infection, and can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A number of molecular mechanisms have been scrutinized to identify the root causes of liver fibrosis. Among these, prominent studies point to aberrant Hedgehog (Hh) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling as prime factors underlying the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, and hence extensively investigated. Accumulating evidence also suggests the role of Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs) in mediating the inflammatory responses of liver cells to endogenous factors and bacterial products present in the liver in NAFLD and NASH. At MAX BioPharma, we have identified semi-synthetic oxysterols that act as Hh pathway modulators, both as agonists and antagonists. We found oxysterol Hh pathway antagonists that also have potent inhibitory effects on TGF-β signaling in fibroblastic cells and in primary human hepatic stellate cells (HSC). With support from an SBIR Phase 1 grant from NIDDK, we recently published findings about the anti-NASH properties of an oxysterol analogue, Oxy210, that has led to the present application. Oxy210 has anti-fibrotic as well as anti- inflammatory properties that are mediated through inhibition of Hh, TGF-β and TLR signaling. Oxy210 induced robust inhibitory effects in a humanized hyperlipidemic mouse model of NASH, ApoE*3-Leiden.CETP mice on a high fat Western Diet, evidenced by inhibition of hepatic lipid deposition, inflammatory cytokine expression and fibrosis, associated with reduced hepatic cell apoptosis and improved circulating ALT levels. Based on these properties of Oxy210, in addition to its favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles, oral availability, and scalability, in the present SBIR Phase 2 application we propose to continue the examination of the disease modifying effects of Oxy210 in ApoE*3-Leiden.CETP mice in reversing already established disease in contrast to our published report when Oxy210 was administered at the initiation of the disease. We propose to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms of anti-NASH properties of Oxy210 by performing metabolic tests as well as RNA-sequencing studies in livers of NASH mice with or without Oxy210 treatment. We propose to perform non-GLP in vitro and in vivo safety studies that will provide essential information for future IND-enabling GLP studies required in our anticipated IND filing for Oxy210 as a first-in-class new drug candidate for targeting NASH. NASH is a huge unmet medical need since there are no FDA approved therapies, leaving a large global population susceptible to severe liver failure and the need for liver transplantation.",  ,,,,FARHAD  PARHAMI,,3108255729,fparhami@mednet.ucla.edu,,  ,

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project supports development and validation of a comfortable, effective, dense-breast cancer imaging device built upon a new method and design for Computed Tomography (CT). This CT-based device does not require breast compression, and is smaller, faster, and higher in spatial resolution than alternative 3-dimensional imaging technologies. The instrument will provide spectral information used to distinguish deadly from non-deadly cancers from both dense and non-dense tissues across the entire breast, including regions near the chest and underarm. Nearly 50% of the U.S. female population has dense breasts. The most widely used technologies for breast imaging today —Mammography and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis — underserve these women. This technology cannot reliably image breast regions near the chest and underarm where cancers occur.Current methods also cannot reliably distinguish healthy, but dense, breast tissue from cancer. During this SBIR project, testing and validation of the developed device will be carried out using human-like surrogates called anthropomorphic phantoms. The company will demonstrate that this new technology provides high quality dense-tissue imaging, consistent whole-breast imaging, and spectral information that is of clinical benefit in cancer detection and diagnosis._x000D_

wide has ushered in a new era of epigenetic research, placing histone PTMs and associated mechanisms in the
spotlight as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Despite this progress, leveraging epigenomics for clinical
research has been hindered by a lack of high-performance genomic mapping assays that are compatible with
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, due to DNA damage that is incurred during the FFPE process.
Indeed, existing FFPE sample-compatible genomic mapping assays are either low-throughput and insensitive
(requiring large sample inputs), or do not resolve specific chromatin features (e.g., promoters, enhancers, etc.).
Therefore, next-generation chromatin profiling assays that are able to resolve specific chromatin features using
banked FFPE samples are key to unlock access to the massive collection of banked clinical samples and enable
novel biomarker discovery / validation for disease-relevant histone PTM targets. To meet this need, EpiCypher
is developing CUTANA-FFPETM, a first-in-class low input genomic mapping solution for the study of FFPE clinical
samples. This technology is inspired by EpiCypher’s commercial CUTANA® CUTandTag (Cleavage Under Targets
and Tagmentation) assays, and leverages an innovative in vitro transcription-based workflow to mitigate the
limitations imposed by FFPE sample processing-induced DNA damage. The goal of this Phase I study is to
demonstrate the ability of CUTANA-FFPE assays to reliably map histone PTMs in FFPE tissue samples. In Aim
1, we will develop the CUTANA-FFPE workflow to map histone PTMs in fixed cultured cells. Then, in Aim 2, we
will employ CUTANA-FFPE assays in clinical FFPE tissue samples and benchmark our results with genomic
maps derived from donor-matched fresh frozen tissue. This study will demonstrate feasibility for CUTANA-FFPE
to become a powerful new tool to perform high-value epigenomic research in previously inaccessible banked
clinical samples. This technology will be of broad interest to basic researchers and drug developers, unlocking
the full potential of epigenomics for clinical applications. In Phase II, we will develop robust CUTANA-FFPE kits
and automated assay protocols that are optimized for FFPE tissue using ultra-low sample inputs, which will be
key for commercializing CUTANA-FFPE to enable epigenomic studies of FFPE clinical samples.",  ,,,,MICHAELCHRISTOPHER  KEOGH,,(617) 899-7804,mkeogh@epicypher.com,,  ,

Deaths from solid tumors vastly outnumber deaths from hematopoietic cancers. Yet progress in
immunotherapies for solid tumors is well behind those for lymphoma. CAR-T cell therapies and
engineered T cells have become revolutionary approaches for hematopoietic cancers, but their
potential for solid tumors is yet to be realized. Significant challenges hinder the potential of
immune therapies in solid tumors, including insufficient activation and eventual exhaustion of
effector T cells; and suppression of T cell effector responses in the tumor microenvironment. In
this proposal we consider these hurdles and offer a biomaterial solution that overcomes them.
This proposal is significant in facilitating endogenous T cells to fight solid tumors. Surgery is a
major treatment modality for both invasive and in situ tumors, but at this time, there are no specific
immunotherapies initiated at the time of surgery; they all start days to weeks later. Our proposal
is significant for offering a way to start treatments early, right at the time of initial surgery. Here
our synthetic scaffold, SymphNode can be injected at the time of biopsy or surgery not to only
recruit and active tumor-experienced local immune cells but also to suppress the inhibitory cells
created by tumor cells. Our long-term goal is to develop this bioengineered, locally injected,

Low-cost, instantaneous nitrate testing readouts from plant stalks will provide more actionable information to guide farmers’ fertilization decisions than current methods to test N levels in soil (e.g., collect soil samples, ship them to lab, and then wait ~1 week for lab analysis). The improvements in fertilizer-management decisions, enabled by more accessible and more actionable data, have the potential to reduce total N fertilizer applications in the US by some 2 million tons annually. This large reduction in N fertilizer applications would decrease the energy footprint of agriculture, reduce emissions of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas 300 times as potent as carbon dioxide, and improve water quality through reductions in N runoff, improving ecosystem services and human health through improved rural water quality and the reduction in hypoxic dead zones._x000D__x000D_

Anticipated results are that the data from the sensors will be used to build predictive models that output optimum N fertilization recommendations that will outperform conventional models.

The current global pandemic has highlighted the need to develop new methods for creating vaccines. Many
approaches today face limitations with breadth and duration of protection; flexibility and adaptability for emerging
strains; manufacturing speed and safety; and storage and distribution. SolaVAX™ inactivation technology offers
an elegant solution for quickly generating highly effective vaccines by using a combination of a photosensitizer
(riboflavin/vitamin B2) and UV light to disrupt pathogen genetic material while preserving target antigens. Likely
advantages of SolaVAX-derived vaccines include: more complete antigen presentation using whole pathogens;
multiple virus strains/ multiple antigen variants, i.e. multivalent; rapid manufacturing pivot to address emergent
strains; no toxic inactivating chemicals that potentially compromise antigen conformation and add to
manufacturing complexity; low cost, geographically distributed manufacturing; applicable to viral, bacterial and
parasitic pathogens. In recent work supported by BARDA and NIH, Drs. Raymond Goodrich and Izabela Ragan
demonstrated that a SolaVAX™-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dramatically decreased viral load, reduced lymphocytic
infiltration and neutrophil accumulation, and maintained lung alveolar air space after virus exposure. From these
studies, the SolaVAX™-SARS-CoV-2 investigational vaccine is estimated to be up to 20,000x more effective on
a weight/weight basis of dose compared to other inactivation methods.
This SBIR project will focus on the evaluation of the SolaVAX approach for creating improved influenza vaccines
composed of whole inactivated virions. Although global attention has been focused on COVID-19 since 2020,
the pandemic threat of influenza still exists. Moreover, the risk of a pandemic influenza may be exacerbated by
SARS-CoV-2, given the burden on global healthcare systems and increased number of individuals with pre-
existing conditions, such as compromised respiratory systems. Current flu vaccines provide sub-optimal
protection (40-60%) and improved approaches for multi-strain and/or universal protection are needed. In
promising preliminary in vitro studies, a SolaVAX-generated influenza vaccine provided 70-80% retention of
hemagglutinin (HA) activity, as compared to 40-45% after inactivation by formalin. Phase I of this project will
build on these studies to establish the vaccine development process that yields full inactivation with maximal
antigen integrity (AIM 1). Then, we will evaluate inactivated vaccine for immunogenicity in mice (AIM 2) and
efficacy against live viral challenge in ferret (AIM 3).",  ,,,,IZABELA  RAGAN,,(970) 491-3456,izabela.ragan@solarisvax.com,,  ,

However, outcomes remain poor for patients with mCRC and since targeted therapies and immunotherapies provide only a limited benefit to a sub-set of CRC patients, new approaches are urgently needed. Deep Creek Pharma together academic partner Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSM) is developing CF10, the first DNA-based FP polymer, as an improved treatment for CRC. In pre-clinical studies through Phase 1 STTR support, we have demonstrated that CF10 is much more potent than 5-FU to CRC cells and demonstrated improved survival relative to 5-FU in multiple colon tumor models in rodents. Further, CF10 displayed reduced systemic toxicities relative to 5-FU making it a strong candidate for clinical development. We have also established CF10 displays distinct pharmacological and mechanistic properties relative to conventional FP drugs. Based on these findings, DeepCreek Pharma and WFSM/Gmeiner Lab propose to jointly investigate CF10 as a candidate for clinical development. A major unmet need is treatment of mCRC that is refractory to FOLFOX (5-FU, Leucovorin (LV), oxaliplatin), and other front-line therapies for mCRC. The proposed research in phase II will therefore focus on (Aim 1) Developing CF10 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and testing for improved activity, including in a therapy-resistant CRC liver metastasis model. LNP formulation has proven to be a robust delivery strategy for multiple nucleic acid drugs, and identifying a preferred LNP formulation will promote CF10 clinical development. In Aim 2 of the Phase II studies we will perform safety pharmacology studies of CF10 and CF10:LNPs in rodents while in Aim 3 we will evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) and biodistribution in non-human primates (NHPs).

which will need an intervention or surgery within their first year of life. Circa 1 million children and 1.4 million
adults live with CHD in the US, and over 182,000 heart valve replacements are performed every year. Currently,
available heart valve prostheses do not perform as native cardiac tissue and have several limitations related to
their durability and ability to support tissue regeneration. In addition, they have been associated with
complications such as clots, increased risk of thrombosis and thromboembolism, calcification, and infection.
Replacement of bioprosthetic valves often requires complex and high-risk operations and poses an economic
burden of $1.7B in the US per year to the healthcare system.
Neoolife aims to overcome these major drawbacks in CHD therapy by developing tissue engineered heart
valves (TEHVs) that are fabricated using scaffolds that mimic human tissue. Through endogenous tissue growth,
Neoolife’s biomimetic pulmonary heart valves are extensively augmented or eventually replaced, leaving
autologous and functional leaflets that grow with the CHD pediatric patient that are durable and non-
thrombogenic. These biomimetic valves do not require life-long blood thinner treatments and are resistant to
calcification and infection. In this STTR Phase I project, Neoolife will modify its proprietary Double Component
Deposition (DCD) technology to obtain a more homogeneous biomimetic scaffold deposition. Biomimetic
pulmonary heart valve prototypes (n=10) will be fabricated using a new multiple stage processing setup. The
prototypes will be tested in vitro for their mechanical and functional properties and assessed in vivo (n=5, 180
days) to evaluate polymer degradation, cellularization, biomechanics, and valve function.
In Phase II, further in vitro and in vivo studies will be performed to provide sufficient technical information to
demonstrate that Neoolife developed pulmonary heart valve qualifies for obtaining a Humanitarian Device
Exemption (HDE) designation for the treatment of pediatric CHD.",  ,,,,ANTONIO  DAMORE,,(412) 620-3496,and78@pitt.edu,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH,  ,

Developing RNA therapeutics for rare neurodevelopmental disorders
Monogenic diseases caused by mutations in single genes are individually rare, but collectively common affecting
10% of the world population. Many of these diseases are disabling or even life threatening with no available
treatment. The underlying molecular mechanisms vary. Both loss of gene function and gain of toxic or dominant
negative effects can lead to pathology, and modification of gene expression could be disease modifying. DAYI
Therapeutics, Inc is a spin-out of Columbia University Medical Center that has the goal of advancing precisely
targeted RNA therapeutics for the treatment of rare monogenic diseases, especially neurological disorders
affecting the brain and behavior. Using a proprietary target discovery platform developed by our academic co-
founders, we have prioritized a list of target genes causing severe neurodevelopmental disorders with
tremendous unmet medical needs. These target genes are in general difficult to target with current approaches
but are druggable with our unique technology to identify endogenous, naturally occurring gene regulatory regions
that can be targeted by different therapeutic modalities including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). In this
proposal, we aim to develop the first therapeutic for a severe developmental and intellectual disability syndrome
by restoring gene expression and protein function using an ASO. The feasibility of our approach is supported
by compelling preliminary data. We propose to perform a systematic ASO drug screen to identify the most
effective ASOs as drug lead and then conduct a series of pre-clinical studies to validate their efficacy in correcting
the molecular, cellular and behavioral deficits caused by the mutation using patient-derived iPSCs, brain
organoids and mouse models. ASOs are an established therapeutic agent with the advantage of high target
specificity, clear mode of action, and accelerated timeline from drug discovery to clinical deployment. If
successful, this study will provide the critical first step to develop a novel ASO therapeutic to fulfill unmet medical
needs and potentially also serve as proof of principle for treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders caused by
mutations in a wide range of genes.",  ,,,,FRANCESCO  LOTTI,,(212) 342-0976,fl2219@cumc.columbia.edu,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY,  ,

Colorectal cancer is still a major cause of cancer-related death in the world and only a small subset of
patients benefits from therapy by immune checkpoint inhibitors. Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) are
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are covalently linked to cell-killing drugs and have emerged as a
major modality in anti-cancer treatment. This approach combines high specificity of mAbs against their
antigen targets with highly potent cytotoxic drugs, resulting in “armed” mAbs that deliver the payload
(drug) to tumor cells with enriched levels of the antibody target. The approach has become a major
modality of cancer therapeutics with several ADCs approved in the last few years. Leucine-rich repeat
containing, G protein-coupled receptor 4, 5 and 6 (LGR4-6) are three related receptors that are highly
upregulated in colorectal cancers. They bind R-spondins (RSPOs), a group of secreted proteins with
high affinity and potentiate Wnt signaling. Aberrant RSPO-LGR signaling plays critical roles in tumor
formation, progression, and drug resistance. In particular, LGR5 is enriched in cancer stem cells of
colon cancer and LGR5-positive cells drive tumor growth and metastasis. However, LGR5-positive and
-negative cells can interconvert and ADCs targeting LGR5 inhibited tumor growth but failed to
completely eradicate tumors due to cancer cell plasticity. Remarkably, LGR5-negative cells still
express LGR4 or LGR6 or both. We reasoned that simultaneous targeting LGR4-6 may overcome
cancer cell plasticity and drug resistance. Recently, we demonstrated that a mutated form of RSPO
can bind to LGR4-6 with high affinity without potentiating Wnt signaling. Drug conjugates of RSPO
mutant fused to IgG1-Fc domain was able to inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We have
now generated a pyrrolobenzodiazepine dimer (PBD)-based drug conjugate of an RSPO2 mutant that
showed potent anti-tumor effect in colon cancer models in vitro and in vivo. In this proposal we will
evaluate the drug conjugate in a series of colon cancer models in vitro and in vivo and determine its
tolerability in mice. These results and conclusions may, for the first time, validate PBD-conjugated
RSPO-Fc protein as a novel approach for simultaneous targeting of LGR4-6 for colorectal cancer
treatment and identify drug candidates for further development.",  ,,,,JIE  CUI,,(917) 459-3240,jie_cui@wntrix.com,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,  ,

The system combines an innovative motion-based game interface with software that provides an immersive experience into motor control disorders and promotes inquiry-based challenges. Importantly, lesson modules are presented to the student with a focus on design thinking and empathy to enable a positive experience for students of diverse of abilities and backgrounds. Problem to be Addressed: U.S. students rank poorly for performance in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields; the number of students who pursue STEM and healthcare careers is not sufficient to meet the needs of the modern workplace. Interactive digital media (IDM) targeted towards STEM education provide students with engaging experiences that improve learning and interest in the STEM fields. However, design of software that is effective for learning and readily applicable to classrooms is a challenging task, particularly when the goal is to engage a range of socioeconomic groups. Long-Term Goal: Improve STEM learning and interest in K-12 students from diverse backgrounds. Phase I Results: During the Phase I effort, a prototype EMPATHIE system was developed and verified to be functional with electromyography sensors in a classroom setting. Evaluation with middle school students demonstrated a statistically significant increase in science learning following the EMPATHIE lesson. Phase II Hypotheses: The SBIR Phase II program will test the hypotheses that students who complete EMPATHIE lessons, expanded for middle school life science, physical science, and engineering design, will see statistically significant increases in both science interest and learning compared to a control lesson. Phase II Summary: Barron Associates, Inc. (award-winning innovators in the field of serious video games) has partnered with educational leaders who champion design thinking and diversity in STEM for this SBIR Phase II program. The specific objectives of the Phase II program are to: (1) develop the Phase II commercial-ready electromyography game-control hardware; (2) conduct participatory design sessions to inform updated game story frameworks and engagement mechanisms targeted towards a variety of student populations and obtain feedback from teachers; (3) create lesson content, which expands the Phase I lessons for use in additional science classrooms, along with teacher training materials; (4) develop the Phase II EMPATHIE game software comprised of expanded lesson content and learning challenges; (5) perform usability testing; and (6) conduct formal assessment of learning and engagement levels with middle school students following sessions with the expanded EMPATHIE game.

Currently, the average U.S. college dropout rate is 40%. Moreover, underserved Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) student populations are more likely to leave school without a degree. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, increased financial insecurity and mental health challenges have negatively impacted student learning. This project aims to develop a student learning dashboard platform that acts as a co-pilot during students' higher education learning journey by delivering targeted, personalized, and real-time actionable assistance. The solution holistically identifies each student's unique learning motivation challenges (e.g., subject difficulty, relevance to career goals, social and economic constraints, etc.) and provides specific recommendations to overcome barriers. Coaching students to learn how to learn more effectively based on their own context fosters a growth mindset, grit, and agency to help them become successful lifelong learners.The application also significantly improves diversity, equity, and inclusion in higher education, especially in STEM, and thus increases effective workforce training. _x000D_

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project uses machine learning to understand each student's unique learning challenges, map how barriers affect learning motivation, and influences coursework engagement. Machine learning is applied to analyze qualitative and quantitative learning motivation and behavior data to identify gaps so real-time, targeted, and relevant guidance can be delivered while the students are still progressing through the courses rather than waiting until it might be too late for intervention. This project provides descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive recommendations to simulate one-on-one, personalized advising at scale and at a lower cost. The technology also acts as an early detection system when students show the first sign of academic and non-academic struggles affecting their mental state of readiness to learn. When in-person human intervention is required, instructors, academic advising, and/or relevant on-campus student support services can be alerted.

Schools are the most common setting for MH service delivery to children and adolescents, therefore, improving the capacity of school- based MH providers to easily access and use validated, high quality MH screening and assessment instruments to identify students in need of services is a significant public health need. Unfortunately, school health and MH professionals face several barriers to using validated MH screening tools, including lack of familiarity with and access to established measures, scoring and interpretation challenges, and limited time and resources to set up and administer MH assessment. Significant public health impact would be realized by investing resources in evidence-based screening and assessment technology products that are feasible, affordable, and usable for schools. The goal of this Direct to Phase II SBIR is to increase access to and use of established high quality MH and MH-related assessment measures in schools. We will develop the SHARE (Student Health Assessment, Response, and Evaluation) software system through iterative, user-centered testing. SHARE will be designed to overcome logistical (e.g., cost, time) and implementation (e.g., administration, scoring) barriers that limit use of available measures, so schools can feasibly implement MH screening and assessment on a routine basis and, ultimately, narrow the gap in access to MH care for youth. This SBIR will further the successful collaboration of 3C Institute and the National Center for School Mental Health (NCSMH). 3C brings essential skills in how to build easy-to-use, feasible technology products for schools, including research-driven platforms for online data collection with youth, meaningful data displays, and integrated decision aids, along with an established technology infrastructure to ensure secure data collection, transfer, and storage.

Past work has resulted in a socially assistive robot (SAR) and virtual health assistant overseen by humans that improves health outcomes and reduces loneliness in older adults at a lower cost of care. Customer loyalty is world-class and far exceeds net promotor scores (NPS) for well-known conversational agents, attesting to the product’s commercial potential. Moreover, active Phase II funding (5R44AG0620-14-03) has resulted in an automated speech recognition (ASR) engine that is more accurate in understanding truly natural speech by older adults, including those with ADRD, than major conversional AI platforms. This is significant given the inherent challenges that the speech of older adults, especially of those with ADRD, poses to conversational AI due to normal age-related neurological changes or brain pathology associated with ADRD. Leveraging these advances and innovations, care.coach is preparing for rapid growth and has attracted considerable interest from insurers, corporate development arms of large insurers, and traditional investors. To successfully scale, we propose to re-platform our current system on top of an enterprise-grade, integrated knowledge solution enabled by KIE, an opensource platform powered by KIE’s Drools/jBPM rules and process engines. The KIE platform has revolutionized enterprise operations, and has been adopted in healthcare to drive quality and efficiency with applications ranging from the adjudication of health insurance claims to the implementation of clinical decision support systems. In addition to business process automation, the cost of goods sold (COGS) will come down with full conversational automation in allowable use cases by training and using a large language model. Both capabilities will be developed in the proposed CRP using state-of-the-art technical approaches, and will be evaluated for performance and acceptance in a replication study with ADRD patients in partnership with a health plan and medical providers that serve a large, diverse elderly population. This technical assistance and late-stage development will deliver a state-of-the-art, consumer-facing conversa- tional agent and virtual health assistant driven by a technology platform with industrial production and automa- tion methods that ensure consistent and scalable digital health service delivery and manufacturing, and that meet the highest security and consumer satisfaction standards.

In Phase I, automated, machine learning-based seizure detection algorithms will be designed to first work in the Aura cloud to detect seizures in Epilog EEG, including seizures a person may not consciously know they are having (>50% of all seizures), such as while sleeping. Aura will run these algorithms developed exclusively for Epilog’s single-channel of EEG to provide a daily digital seizure diary. In Phase II, the Aura system will enter clinical validation trials for FDA clearance as an EEG-based automated home seizure detection and alerting system. Early in Phase II Aura will be commercialized as a medical device-enabled-service business model. Out-of-pocket costs for a person living with epilepsy is an average of $380/year. Armed with long-term, reproducible EEG, epileptologists will now have a more precise, quantitative record of seizure counts, enabling them to adapt patient treatment more rapidly and successfully to improve quality of life. Aura will give people living with epilepsy their lives back. Aura provides certainty where you are and when you need it. Throughout Phase II, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors will be combined in the Aura app to collect 27,000 days of multi-modal data from 300 patients to create an unprecedented dataset of features known to precipitate seizures. These data will be used in Phase III to create a robust, wearable seizure forecasting system using artificial intelligence that combines multi-modal seizure precipitating factors, creating an hourly seizure probability. Aura will profoundly disrupt how epilepsy is managed and improve the quality of life of people living with epilepsy.",  ,,,,MARK J LEHMKUHLE,,7346466266,lehmkuhle@epitel.com,,  ,

By replacing the most wasteful and costly step in the semiconductor manufacturing process, the proposed research will use sound (acoustic) energy to precisely cut semiconductor materials in a way that minimizes waste and enables materials reuse. This technology will dramatically decrease manufacturing costs and, as a result, lead to the accelerated development of faster, smaller, and more efficient devices. _x000D_
_x000D_
This SBIR Phase I project will develop a new approach to lower the cost of advanced semiconductor manufacturing by using sound energy to lift off thin devices from their host substrates. The innovative approach taken in this project uses a technique to propagate a crack front at a precise depth below the device layer of a wafer with the application of acoustic pulses. This acoustic method wastes no material and, most importantly, makes it possible to reuse the substrate, which is currently wasted using standard approaches such as mechanical back grinding. As the single largest cost in manufacturing next-generation devices based on gallium nitride, the substrate material plays a key role in achieving higher performance and efficiencies compared to silicon devices. Making more efficient use of this material directly addresses a pressing need to find solutions that drive down manufacturing costs and accelerates the adoption of new semiconductor innovations ranging from power electronics to communications devices and beyond._x000D_

Discovering therapeutic antibodies traditionally requires costly and labor- intensive, laboratory-based screening experiments. Computational approaches that select antibodies with the most desirable pharmaceutical properties are thus poised to improve health by accelerating the development of new drugs. Unfortunately, current algorithms are often unable to distinguish stronger-binding antibodies from weaker ones. Improvements to structure prediction and molecular visualization will lower costs and increase the speed with which new drugs are developed by allowing researchers to focus on the most promising candidates as early in the process as possible. DNASTAR’s goals are to increase the speed of predicting the structure of antibody-antigen interactions using superior mathematical methods and to transform antibodies with micromolar binding affinity into those with improved nanomolar affinity using new computer-aided antibody design techniques. This will accelerate antibody discovery by enabling detailed and accurate immune complex structure predictions and structure-based chemical liability detection at a high-throughput scale. In Phase II, we first created an in silico human germline sequence library and used it to simulate the natural V(D)J and VJ recombination events of the immune system, generating a new library of assembled antibody sequences. To select antibody candidates that bound a chosen target, we developed a simulation algorithm in which antibody candidates were docked against a chosen target protein. The 24 candidates with the best predicted binding energy were converted to single-chain antibodies and propagated in CHO cells. Three candidates were found to bind the target using native Western blots. The binding affinity and kinetics of these three candidates were then measured by bio-layer interferometry. The tightest binding candidate was then subjected to a form of simulated affinity maturation where individual site-directed mutations were ranked by their predicted ability to enhance affinity for the antigen. Four out of five tested variants showed improved binding over its parent using bio-layer interferometry. The goal of our Phase IIB proposal is to build upon this success and further improve predictive capability by incorporating unequaled algebraic mathematics and computational acceleration techniques to support the virtual screening of tens of thousands of antibody sequences. For the first time in history, this will enable antibodies to be selected for development by first modeling them from germline sequences using a “virtual immune system.” Our ultimate intent is to deliver a complete antibody discovery pipeline that is powerful, accurate, produces fast results, and yields lab-scale quantities of DNA and protein materials for the selected antibodies.",  ,,,,FREDERICK R BLATTNER,,6082519284,fredblattner@scarabgenomics.com,,  ,

Yet despite extensive efforts to inhibit Wnt/-catenin signaling, no drugs that target the Wnt pathway have been approved, mainly due to the inability of inhibitors drugs to separate oncogenic from homeostatic functions of -catenin. BCL9 is a transcriptional co- activator that regulates oncogenic β-catenin-mediated gene transactivation. Its overexpression enhances Wnt/β- catenin signaling, resulting in cell proliferation, migration and invasiveness in vitro, and induces tumor initiation and progression in vivo. Genetic ablation of Bcl9/Bcl9l in mouse intestinal epithelium reduces tumor growth without phenotypic abnormalities. Therefore, specific antagonism of the interaction of β-catenin with BCL9 is hypothesized to prove a safe and efficacious strategy for cancer therapy. Sapience Therapeutics sought to develop a -catenin antagonist peptide, designed to interact with -catenin. Our approach introduces amino acid (AA) substitutions to the native HD2 binding domain sequence to enhance target affinity and includes a short cell penetrating domain (CPD) for intracellular entry. Additionally, to overcome challenges encountered by traditional peptides, Sapience’s peptides include D-enantiomer AAs (D-AAs), which dramatically increase stability and bioavailability, while reducing potential immunogenicity. Through extensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, we screened a library of peptides designed to disrupt β-catenin’s oncogenic association with BCL9 and selected ST316 as the lead candidate. ST316 displays potent and selective inhibition of Wnt signaling and induction of cytotoxicity in tumor cells dependent on Wnt signaling (but not Wnt-independent tumors). Further, ST316 demonstrates stability, superior bioavailability and solubility and in vivo potency. In Phase I of this SBIR, ST316 demonstrated nanomolar binding affinity to β- catenin and a low micromolar (2.7µM) EC50 value for inhibition of β-catenin transcriptional activity in vitro. Safety studies with no histopathological findings at 50mg/kg suggested a therapeutic window of at least 10x. Following this proof of concept, this Phase II application proposes rigorous IND-enabling toxicology and phar- macology studies to support clinical development of ST316. Specific Aim #1 will determine the first-in-human (FIH) ST316 dose by identifying the no adverse effect level (NOAEL) in rats and highest non-severely toxic dose (HNSTD) in minipigs in 28-day repeat dose GLP toxicity studies. In Specific Aim #2, we propose a series of experiments to determine the ST316 pharmacologic active dose (PAD) in mouse patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, and identify pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers associated with the PAD, which can be used clinically to assess ST316 activity. The PAD will then be used in Specific Aim #3 to evaluate the impact of ST316 on the tumor immune microenvironment (TME), namely macrophage polarization, tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) expression in tumors and the impact of combination with a PD-1 inhibitor.",  ,,,,JIM  ROTOLO,,9146076935,jrotolo@sapiencetherapeutics.com,,  ,

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an average of 95,158 alcohol-attributable deaths (261 deaths per day) is reported only in the United States, with associated annual costs of $249 billion. The goal of this project is to develop a wearable integrated device capable of continuously measuring, recording, and storing ISF alcohol levels in real-time without the need for external calibrations. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) seeks a wearable alcohol monitoring device that can continuously measure real-time alcohol levels in the blood or interstitial fluid (ISF), and this proposal is highly aligned with the NIAAA’s mission. An accurate wearable alcohol sensor will serve useful purposes in different settings, including research programs, clinics, forensic applications, and consumer use to promote responsible alcohol consumption. The available transdermal alcohol monitoring devices, relying on alcohol detection in sweat or sweat vapor, face significant problems such as long lag times (up to several hours) and tend to be cumbersome. In this context, ActioX, LLC has developed a non-obtrusive wearable sensor platform to enable pain-free analysis few hundred microns under the skin, directly in the ISF. The novel sensing technology relies on a biocompatible array of microneedles, optimized for painless skin penetration, and thus to provide continuous access to constantly revitalizing ISF. This fully integrated wirelessly operated device is composed of two components of a reusable electronics and a disposable microneedle array, along with a successful demonstration of a custom- designed app for data capture and visualization. Our preliminary data using the prototype device showed successful real-time tracking of ISF alcohol in response to alcohol drinking episodes in multiple human subjects, with the results well correlated to those from a breathalyzer.

Building from a prototype system, this SBIR Phase I project aims to engineer improvements that will increase the efficacy and tractability of the microbial biopesticide in outdoor agricultural environments. This includes applying molecular biology techniques to increase microbial colonization within complex microflora to increase product efficacy, extend microbial persistence in plants to provide longer protection, and reduce the rate of resistance to extend product lifetimes. Furthermore, this project will develop a bioinformatics algorithm to better program the microbes to specifically target only the disease-causing pathogens. Finally, the team will demonstrate product efficacy in lab-grown tomato plants with the goal of surpassing the industry standard of 70% efficacy and will compare performance to two industry standard chemical pesticides. Successful completion of this project will result in a novel method to introduce protective traits to crops without genetically modifying the plant itself._x000D_

ARCHE VR LLC,Impact VR: An Emotion Recognition and Regulation Training Program for Youth with Conduct Disorder,Department of Health and Human Services,National Institutes of Health,Phase I,STTR,R41MH133540,1R41MH133540-01,5/1/23,11/1/24,PA22-179,2022.0,,9/6/22,104,2023.0,426649.0,V8KZWL8C6GH4,,N,N,N,4.0,https://www.ArcheVR.com,12400 PERRYWINKLE RD,,GLEN ALLEN,Virginia,23059-5319,"ABSTRACT Conduct disorder (CD) remains one of the most common, impairing, and costliest psychiatric disorders among youth. Youth with CD often face lifelong adjustment, mental health, legal, social, occupational, and physical health problems. A subset of youth with CD display callous-unemotional (CU) traits (termed “limited prosocial emotions”). Youth with CD and CU traits are more likely to engage in chronic criminal behaviors and develop psychopathology into adulthood when compared to youth with CD only. Although both CD and CU traits are inextricably linked to poor outcomes, there remains a scarcity of targeted interventions for CD and CU traits. One of the most significant challenges for treatment is that youth with CD are often perceived as treatment-resistant and treatment disrupters. This leads to poor treatment retention and further isolation from treatment opportunities. Interventions that do exist largely focus on reducing antisocial behavior rather than disrupting the developmental mechanisms of CD and CU traits. Arche VR, LLC, a Virginia-based small business, aims to offer a solution to this problem by providing a culturally appropriate, cutting-edge virtual reality (VR) intervention for CD and CU traits called Impact VR. Impact VR provides brief psychoeducational programming for emotion regulation and emotion recognition training using immersive gameplay and storylines that are engaging and relevant to youth. Impact VR is developed using evidence-based strategies to improve emotion regulation. At the center of Impact VR is an individualized training program that teaches youth to effectively identify emotional expressions in others. Impact VR uses cutting-edge technologies, including integrated eye-tracking and real- time adaptive programming to adjust instruction based on the youths' performance. This ensures that youth receive tailored, individualized treatment without the risk of floor and ceiling effects. Further, Impact VR provides a resource-efficient and standardized treatment approach for systems (e.g., schools, hospitals) to help improve access to evidence-based mental health treatment for youth with CD by targeting the mechanisms of CD and CU traits. The overall objective of this proposal is to refine Impact VR to be an engaging and topic-relevant intervention that youth with CD will want to participate in, and to determine the feasibility and usability of the deployment of Impact VR across treatment settings (i.e., in the home, school, and mental health settings). Lastly, this study includes a randomized control trial (RCT) to assess the preliminary efficacy of Impact VR for reducing CD, CU traits, and conduct problems (CP) and improving emotion recognition and regulation. Outcomes from this Phase I study include overall improvements in Impact VR as a deployment-ready, effective, and engaging treatment strategy for youth with CD and CU traits.",  ,,,,SCOTT R VRANA,,8048281242,svrana@archevr.com,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,  ,

The incidence of US tick-borne diseases has more than doubled in the last two decades. Today, Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States, impacting over half-a-million Americans each year. Due to lack of effective vaccines for tick-borne diseases, prevention of tick bites and early tick bite treatment is the primary focus of disease mitigation. Tick vector surveillance—monitoring an area to understand tick species composition, abundance, and spatial distribution—is key to providing the public with accurate and up-to-date information when they are in areas of high risk, and enabling precision vector control when necessary. Despite the importance of vector surveillance, current practices are highly resource intensive and require significant labor and time to collect and identify vector specimens. Acarologist or field taxonomist expertise is a limited resource required for tick identification, creating a significant capability barrier for national tick surveillance practice. While mobile applications to facilitate passive surveillance and reporting of human-tick encounters have grown in popularity, variable image quality, limited engagement, and scientist misidentification of rare, invasive, or morphologically similar tick species hinder the scalability of this approach. To date, no automated solutions exist to build tick identification capacity. We seek to advance Phase I work that successfully achieved an imaging and automated identification system capable of instantaneously and accurately identifying twelve adult tick species with 98% accuracy. This proposal will first improve the Phase I optical design for scalability to accommodate imaging of additional intra-specific tick species variability as nymphs, adult males, and unfed or engorged adult females. In parallel, we develop methods to optimize quality of guided user imaging of ticks in a mobile app approach for the general public. This will enable the development of a representative image database with partners including TickSpotters, TickCheck, the Walter Reed Biosystems Unit (WRBU), and others. The resulting database will be used to train, validate, test and deploy high-accuracy computer vision models in two tick identification products for professional public health and the general public. Ultimately the approaches developed here will enable vector management organizations to leverage image recognition in a practical system that will increase capacity and capability for biosurveillance, and equip the general public with improved tools to identify ticks during a human-tick encounter.",  ,,,,AUTUMN  GOODWIN,,8584424658,autumn@vectech.io,,  ,

HazMat Risk Management, Readiness and Training Platform
A unique aspect of hazardous material incidents is that they affect stakeholders in the community with different
roles and priorities. Workers in facilities who regularly use or handle hazardous materials, transportation
carriers, neighboring communities, first responders, and first receivers (health care workers) are all at risk of
health impacts from hazardous materials. Communities can increase their resilience to a hazardous materials
incident in several ways, including reducing the likelihood of a release, being prepared to respond to a potential
release, and effectively responding if a release does occur. We believe technology advancements and new
training strategies can better equip communities for risk reduction and the rapid and effective response to
incidents. The technology advancements proposed will collectively cover the HazMat risk life cycle from a
facilities prevention and risk management perspective, a first responders pre-planning specific to risks in their
community and a HazMat Incident Command training platform.",  ,,,,HENRY  RYNG,,(602) 347-9575,ryng@inxsol.com,,  ,

However, while past work on narrative extraction and analysis provides useful ‘snapshots’ of a narrative at a given point in time, it generally fails to 1) distinguish over-arching, foundational narratives from concrete, focal events that impact those narratives, 2) track the evolution, merging, and splitting of narratives over time, quantifying changes caused by focal events, and 3) capture the interactive competition and coordination of distinct narratives as they spread within social networks and sub-networks. To address these gaps, we propose to develop a framework (called RAVEN) for extracting, assessing, and forecasting evolving narratives in social networks. Our approach seeks to 1) identify and characterize the key narrative frames and structures, grounded in group interests, ideology, and morals, that shape perception and response to concrete focal events, 2) detect related focal events and quantify their impact on narratives, and 3) analyze how narratives interact within dynamic social networks. To tackle these distinct but essentially inter-related challenges, we exploit a variety of new and established AI and NLP techniques. To identify and characterize key narrative frameworks, we leverage deep language models, named entity recognition, topic modeling, and stance and emotion analysis. To detect focal events, we employ advances in event extraction and relation extraction. We will establish the feasibility of RAVEN in Phase I by demonstrating an initial implementation of an analytics pipeline that identifies, characterizes, and tracks evolving narratives along with the focal events that drive narrative change. To this end, we will pursue three main objectives. Objective 1 aims to build upon the foundational narrative extraction methodology developed by our Co-Investigator, Dr. Nitin Agarwal, augmenting narrative representations using state-of-the-art emotion detection and stance detection algorithms. This will allow us to prioritize narratives that express social, moral, or ideological responses and commitments. Objective 2 seeks to extract focal events and link them to their associated narratives via shared actors, entities, and topics. Objective 3 seeks to model the spread and evolution of narratives across online communities (networks) and sub-networks, identifying the specific network properties that predict narrative propagation.",sbir@socom.mil  sbir@socom.mil,,,sbir@socom.mil,Benjamin  Welborn,,(937) 750-0407,sbir@socom.mil,,  ,

In particular, Tomorrow.io will demonstrate the feasibility of the research and development required to develop the requisite technical capabilities needed by the DoD. This will include the weather forecasting capabilities of a specific model as well as the product tech development to use that model for operational decisions.   The proposed approach involves integrating the GALWEM model into our weather engine and subsequently segmenting it from other models utilized in the technology stack. The GALWEM model will be utilized to generate probabilistic outcomes, providing operators with insights into the level of forecast confidence, in addition to the weather forecast itself. Furthermore, we intend to create a library of user defined assets and infrastructure, which can be linked to weather insights. This will facilitate the development of usable weather thresholds for determining go/no-go decisions or risk management considerations for specific assets, locations, and weather conditions.   When the weather science is coupled with the insights, it will build out a technical framework for commands to get valuable weather information on Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) and ultimately be able to train and fight accordingly.

Flu vaccine effectiveness is lower in the elderly than in younger adults, requiring either a high-dose (Fluzone® HD) or an adjuvanted (FluAd®) vaccine. Antigen mismatch in vaccine vs. circulating strains results in insufficient protection, and poor responses in the elderly remain major public health concerns. Cell-mediated immunity may correlate better than humoral immunity for vaccine protection in the elderly. Adjuvants used to enhance vaccine efficacy, such as MPLA, CpG and alum, trigger either innate or antibody responses, but not a T cell response. While existing adjuvants or increased antigen load may partially improve seroconversion, overall vaccine effectiveness and T cell responses may be suboptimal in at-risk populations. New adjuvants are needed that induce robust T cell responses for pathogen clearance. A key factor for suboptimal vaccine effectiveness in the elderly is immunosenescence, a gradual age-related immune decline. Prolonged cell adhesion mediated by integrins α4β1 and αLβ2 and their cognate ligands, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, is essential for effective antigen presentation and T cell priming at the immune synapse between antigen presenting cells (APCs) and naïve T cells, as well as for T cell memory and effector functions. Deficient APC-T cell adhesion attenuates T cell activation and memory. Age-related defects in ICAM-1 induction on activated dendritic cells may decrease T cell priming, resulting in suboptimal vaccine effectiveness in the elderly. 7HP349 is a first-in-concept, oral, small-molecule, allosteric α4β1/αLβ2 activator that may promote APC-T cell adhesion, and improve T helper function and the effectiveness of geriatric influenza vaccination. In mice, 7HP349 significantly improved the effectiveness of influenza, Chagas disease, SARS-CoV- 2 and tuberculosis vaccines, not only via humoral responses but also cell-mediated immunity, which differentiates it from current or emerging competition. A first-in-human Phase I clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK of 7HP349 in healthy male subjects was completed in 4Q 2021. 7HP349 was shown to be safe and orally bioavailable, with no treatment-related serious adverse events. Additionally, the optimal pharmacokinetic dose was identified. In this application, we propose to evaluate 7HP349 as an oral adjuvant to influenza vaccination in aging mice with pre-existing immunity, that would be representative of vaccination in the elderly. Additionally, to activate a supplemental IND for geriatric influenza, we plan to complete additional required Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control activities that will include development of a 100 mg strength to enable once daily, one pill dosing to improve patient compliance, and manufacture of cGMP 7HP349 Drug Product to support the IND and build inventory for a future Phase I/IIa clinical study in elderly subjects to assess the safety of 7HP349 and to evaluate its immunogenicity in combination with Fluzone® HD, which will also lay the foundation for its potential use in enhancing the effectiveness of other infectious disease vaccines in vulnerable sub-populations.",  ,,,,UPENDRA  MARATHI,,8324396612,upendra@7hills.co,,  ,

These challenges manifest themselves where geometric constraints, such as small thicknesses/volumes, coupled with long burn times and high temperature/pressure propellants utilization push materials to steady-state thermal conditions. The specific thermal management technique sought after in this effort is the redesign of the internal construction of a pintle to reduce the axial heat flow while maintaining structural integrity through coupled theoretical thermal-structural modeling. The overall goal of the Phase II program is to build on the favorable Phase I results to further explore and mature geometry-based thermal management for solid rocket motor applications.

Successful completion of aims proposed here will result in the development of a novel peptide mimetic as an intravenous formulation with a rapid onset of action for the treatment of hospitalized patients with acute pancreatitis to rapidly reduce triglycerides to prevent or treat hypertriglyceridemia, and therefore will reduce the length of stay in the hospital and reduce or eliminate the morbidity and mortality. A safety assessment will be completed in IND enabling studies and a NOAEL (no adverse effect load) determined to support first-in-human dosing. This will enable Protean Bio to advance D6PV for Phase 1 clinical trials in normal healthy volunteers to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of D6PV after single and multiple ascending dosing regimens. Once completed and demonstrated to be safe in humans, D6PV is anticipated to progress to Phase 2 trials in hospitalized AP patients for proof- of-concept (i.e., efficacy) for reducing triglycerides in < 4 hours after administration as an intravenous dose. AP is one of the most common diagnosis for GI-related hospitalization with significant morbidity and at an annual cost of $2.6B. Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG) is a leading cause for AP and is known to occur in up to 38% of patients with plasma triglyceride (TG) levels of 3000-5000 mg/dL. Although there are several approved products (e.g., Vascepa®, Epanova®) and new modalities (nucleic acid drugs, antibodies) in Phase 2/3 trials for the treatment of SHTG, they have a delayed onset of action, rendering them unsuitable for rapidly lowering triglycerides in hospitalized AP patients. Therefore, there is a clear unmet need for rapidly addressing elevated TG in AP patients in an acute, hospitalized setting to reduce pain and progression of pancreatic necrosis, organ failure and mortality. Superior ex vivo results were confirmed in in vivo studies in mice models of HTG, demonstrating a ~80% reduction of plasma HTG in 3 hours post dosing and ~85% decrease in plasma ApoC-III; the latter due to displacement by D6PV and subsequent clearance. In this Direct to Phase II grant, we propose to complete engineering validation of the non-GMP manufacturing process, complete IND- enabling studies in rat and dog, and manufacture GMP drug substance and drug product.",  ,,,,MATT  DEVALARAJA,,7349451202,matt@proteanbio.com,,  ,

complicate their care (e.g., a lack of social support, competing responsibilities, or financial hardships),
health care providers can improve health care outcomes and lower costs if they attempt to identify these
“contextual factors” and address them in their care plan – a process termed “contextualizing care.” These
studies utilize a method of data analysis called “Content Coding for Contextualization of Care” (4C). 4C is
a labor-intensive process that requires human coders listen to audio recordings from a sample of medical
encounters, extract data from each patient’s medical record, and then track whether identified contextual
factors have been addressed. It has enormous social value and commercial potential because it accurately
identifies care plans that mitigate social needs and avoid unnecessary care. To date, sharing 4C data with
health systems has led to significant improvements in care and a reduction in rates of hospitalization. The
manual 4C coding process, however, is time consuming and unscalable. The automation of 4C coding
utilizing natural language processing (NLP) would enable rapid scaling.
Objective: Build a prototype system that performs automated 4C coding of transcribed audio-recorded
medical encounters, and assess its accuracy at classifying whether care planning is contextualized,
utilizing a test dataset with human 4C coding as a gold-standard.
Method: We propose an iterative development and validation process, leveraging an existing dataset of
over 400 manually 4C coded transcripts from physician-patient medical encounters. Starting with 300
transcripts previously coded by our team and coding guidelines from the 4C training manual, we will first
develop automated techniques for extracting text features reflective of nuances in linguistic content and
discourse structure that disentangle contextualized care from contextual error, in turn facilitating
development of candidate classification models that emulate human 4C coding decisions. We will then
apply the models to the remaining transcripts to predict transcript- and utterance-level codes, comparing
these codes with the human-labeled gold standard to establish feasibility, analyze performance, and
assess the models’ performance when generalized to new clinical encounters.
Impact: Health care systems are under financial pressure to control costs through a reduction in both

MRS-2541 inhibits bacterial methionyl- tRNA synthetase required for bacterial protein synthesis, which is very different from its mammalian counterpart. MRS-2541 is the result of an arduous testing cascade of over 500 compounds requiring broad-spectrum in vitro and in vivo Gram+ activity, a low resistance frequency and minimal hERG and mitochondrial toxicity. The initial clinical indication will be acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) with clear endpoints and relatively easy enrollments. MRS-2541 is highly potent against serious pathogens such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE), and Streptococcus species, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ≤ 0.5 µg/mL, which are below those of widely used drugs such as vancomycin and linezolid. MRS-2541 has minimal cytotoxicity on mammalian cells, is well tolerated in mice at 150 mg/Kg/day, has excellent oral bioavailability, and is as efficacious as linezolid in the S. aureus and S. pyogenes thigh murine models of infection by both the oral and subcutaneous route. Specific Aim 1 will be to optimize the new 5-step synthesis from a commercially available fluorinated precursor and prepare 150 g for Aims 2-4. Aim 2 will characterize the PK/ADME profile of MRS-2541, including metabolic profiling, cytochrome inhibition, and PK in a non-rodent species. Aim 3 will more fully characterize the antibacterial profile with MIC90s vs target and some off-target organisms, as well as the determination of the driver for in vivo efficacy, which is critical for human dose projections. Finally, Aim 4 will support a GLP 28-day toxicology study in rodents along with several safety pharmacology studies. The scientific teams at University of Washington and TSRL have the combined expertise in chemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, and preclinical drug development to execute the proposed research plan. A successful project will bring forward MRS-2541 as a clinical lead candidate, representing a novel antibiotic class to address the critical public health issue of bacterial drug-resistance not only for ABSSSIs, but for a variety of serious Gram+ infections.",  ,,,,ELKE  LIPKA,,7342236862,elipka@tsrlinc.com,,  ,

Our goal is to develop a novel, immunological-directed synthetic biology-based therapeutic for the treatment of
Multiple Sclerosis (MS). MS is a devastating characterized by an exacerbated immune response that destroy
myelin. This disease affects many important aspects of a patient's life, including emotional well-being, quality
of life, working ability, and social interactions. In addition, MS patients present increased risk of severe
secondary complications, including blindness, kidney failure, stroke, and additional autoimmune disorders.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new cutting-edge strategies to treat MS.
The gut–brain axis has been recognized as a bi-directional communication system connecting the CNS to the
gut13 that is now implicated in the disease etiopathogenesis. MS patients present a dysbiotic gut microbiome
with a deficiency in regulatory T cells (Tregs)15, 16, 18, 19. Probiotic consumption showed an improvement in the
disease severity by increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines and Tregs17, corroborating the important role of the
gut-brain axis. A promising approach for the treatment of MS is to leverage the body’s own natural microbiome-
associated immune regulatory mechanisms with oral, gut localized and targeted therapy to control host
immune cells lining the gut epithelial layer to direct reestablishment of systemic immune homeostasis.
R-2487 is an immunologically-directed recombinant probiotic consisting of the food-grade, Lactococcus (L.)
lactis strain expressing Colonization Factor Antigen I (CFA/I). R-2487 is a live biotherapeutic product that
represents a novel breakthrough approach for the treatment of MS by combining the safety of a probiotic with
the targeted functionality of the CFA/I ligand. R-2487 has been showed to diminish MS-like symptoms in
animals21, 22. R-2487 works via targeted delivery of CFA/I to the intestinal tract where it engages mucosal
dendritic cells to drive systemic upregulation of Tregs. The induction of Tregs resets the balance with
proinflammatory T effector cells to reduce inflammatory processes that contribute to autoimmune disease,
leading to bystander tolerance. Since heterogeneous pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, including MS,
poses many challenges for therapies that target specific antigens for tolerization or a single cell type or
cytokine, R-2487-mediated bystander tolerance induction offers a broader and more impactful mechanism of
disease correction.
This application is designed to complete R-2487 IND enabling studies to support initiation of a first-in-human
MS trial for this important new therapy. The key aims of this proposal are: 1) finalize in vivo characterization of
R-2487, identifying starting clinical dose and important biomarkers to be used in the clinical trial; 2)
manufacture of clinical GMP drug substance and drug product; and 3) complete the IND-enabling GLP
toxicology study. Successful commercialization of R-2487 will provide a profound medical advancement for
treating MS.",  ,,,,CHRISTIAN  FURLANFREGUIA,,(215) 923-1818,cfreguia@risetherapeutics.com,,  ,

Impaired wound healing in diabetic patients represents a major clinical problem, resulting in prolonged
hospitalizations and significant healthcare expenditures. The financial burden of this is extreme, representing
$78 billion annually in the U.S. alone. Two-thirds of all non-traumatic amputations are preceded by a diabetic
wound, and every 20 seconds a lower limb is lost to a diabetic wound. The impaired healing of diabetic wounds
is multifactorial, but a central pathogenic feature is chronic inflammation. These terrible, infection-prone ulcers
are difficult to treat using current technologies and represent a significant under-met need in the marketplace.
Current treatments commonly employed for these conditions involve standard bandages or basic hydrogels
which have many drawbacks, including that they cause inflammatory response, need to be removed and
changed often, and are not capable of sustained drug release. GelSana Therapeutics, Inc. is addressing this
need with its proprietary wound healing hydrogels that help heal wounds significantly faster and without the
downsides of today’s dressings. The hydrogels are based on polymers that repel protein adsorption and prevent
the foreign body response. Further, this class of materials have been shown to be anti-inflammatory. In studies
with diabetic mice with impaired wound healing abilities, GelSana has demonstrated that the hydrogels alone
cut the healing time down to 2/3 of the time of saline-treated diabetic wounds, matching the healing time of
healthy mice. This indicates that the material alone can correct the diabetic impairment to wound healing.
GelSana materials have also been shown to outperform another type of hydrogel used in commercially available
products in the time of healing required for these diabetic murine wounds. Furthermore, hydrogels laden with an
anti-inflammatory drug cut the healing time down by a staggering one-half. In this project, GelSana proprietary
zwitterionic hydrogels will serve as superior wound dressing materials to aid in correcting the diabetic wound
healing impairment by reducing inflammation, where sustained delivery of IL-10 from these dressings will be
demonstrated to further resolve chronic inflammation in the diabetic wound environment and improve
vascularization, thus allowing the diabetic ulcer to heal at a rate equivalent to or faster than that found in non-
diabetic (healthy) saline-treated wounds. This Phase I project will demonstrate feasibility for GelSana zwitterionic
hydrogels with and without IL-10 by (1) characterizing drug release and bioactivity in vitro and (2) assessing
efficacy in an in vivo murine diabetic ulcer model. This will be accomplished with these Aims: Aim 1: To quantify
the release rate and bioactivity of IL-10 from zwitterionic hydrogels. Aim 2: To quantify the impact of
sustained release of the drug on the ability of the drug-device product to improve wound healing in a
murine model. This work will result in a new class of anti-inflammatory pro-regenerative hydrogel wound
dressings with sustained release of novel therapeutics that combat oxidative stress and inflammation and
promote angiogenesis in diabetic wounds to therapeutically decrease inflammation, decrease healing time, and
increase tissue repair quality.",  ,,,,ADAM  ROCKER,,(720) 936-1276,arocker@gelsanatherapeutics.com,,  ,

Biofuel production has been limited by low product yield productivity and titer;whereas biorefinery using lignocellulosic feedstocks suffers from high capital and operationalcosts associated with pretreatments and cellulose hydrolysis which also generate inhibitorsnegatively affecting fermentation performance. We have engineered a clostridia strain as asuperior cell factory that not only can produce n-butanol from both glucose and xylosesimultaneously with high yield and productivity but also has a high tolerance to hydrolysateinhibitors and can use biomass hydrolysates directly without detoxification. This novel cellfactory is robust for butanol production but has not been used in industrial fermentation.

Phase Istudies will assess the feasibility of the proposed bioprocess involving two key fermentationsteps: 1) mixotrophic fermentation for converting glucose and formate to acetate with the co-
cultures of a homolactic acid bacterium and acetogen and 2) butanol production from glucosexylose and acetate by engineered clostridia immobilized in LIBR with in-situ gas stripping.Fermentation kinetics and process performance data (titer rate and yield) will be collected andused in techno-economic analysis (TEA) of the integrated bioprocess which will also includebiomass pretreatment/hydrolysis and pervaporation for final product purification. The proposedfermentation can achieve a 50% increase in butanol yield >10% (w/v) product titer for energyefficient purification and substantial cost reduction to less than $2.5/gal competitive forapplications as industrial solvent and advanced biofuel.Anticipated results and potential commercial applications:Biobutanol is an advanced liquid fuel with an enormous potential to compete with ethanol if itsproduction cost can be reduced to less than $2.5/gal by using low-cost renewable agriculturalresidues such as corn stalk. The proposed process can produce n-butanol at a high yield of ~0.5g/g from lignocellulose sugars (glucose and xylose). The proposed technology thus can providean economically competitive and superior biofuel to replace ethanol for blending in gasoline.This advanced biobutanol process can be readily adopted by the biofuels industry by retrofittingor adding onto existing bioethanol and/or corn-based acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE)fermentation plants. It will thus enhance the economic viability of the rural area wheresubstantial amounts of lignocellulosic wastes are generated and reduce the burden from wastebiomass disposal. Successfully developing the proposed biobutanol fermentation technology willalso satisfy the public interests especially in providing a safe renewable energy protectingnatural resources and the environment and enhancing energy security economic opportunity andquality of life.",  ,,,,David  Ramey,,(614) 499-2700,dramey4u@gmail.com,Ohio State University,  ,

(GNI)The world's population is growing increasing food demand far beyond arable land availability soproducers need a way to increase their yield using current acreage. Low-cost methods to increaseyields in the reality of changing environmental stress is critical to agriculture production and neweconomical and environmentally friendly seed priming techniques can provide this increase despitechanging climate and environmental conditions.It is widely understood that getting crops started earlier helps them compete with weeds. Highergermination rates result in more uniform stands which has been shown to have a 9-22% increase incrop yields increasing producer profitability without increasing land requirements. GNI's DirectedEnergy Seed Priming (DESP) technology provides a way to increase germination rates and hastenemergence of seeds seamlessly integrating with existing practices without adding labor or havingany environmental impact.This proposal is centered around determining the technical viability of an aftermarket upgrade kitfor the integration of DESP into a commercially available planter. GNI will also further quantify themarket potential of a DESP-enhanced planter and the impacts such a product will have on farmerproductivity and profitability. By the end of this project GNI with the support of collaborator CNHIndustrial (CNH) will have verified the feasibility of a DESP aftermarket upgrade kit for acommercially available CNH planter at the specified power levels and targeted price andprofitability points. The specific objectives to achieve this are:1. Design DESP prototype2. Validate DESP prototype with field trial3. Refine DESP row-unit design into full-planter commercial implementation and4. Disseminate findingsPhase I will provide a detailed design of a commercially viable product ready to be used forsoybeans. Seed priming on row crops with DE holds the promise of sustainably increasing outputfrom each acre by 5-10% providing a broad societal benefit of increased food security and theadoption of more sustainable farming practices. With the U.S. soybean market being on the order of$50B if soybean output could be increased by 5% the proposed effort holds the promise ofboosting U.S. agricultural output by over $2B/year for domestic soybean producers representing atremendous return on investment for the project.With the results of Phase I GNI its collaborators and the broader ag research community willunderstand the effectiveness of DE seed priming and its viability as a scalable solution. Theoutcome will stimulate follow-up research into other crops where priming would be of significance.Phase II will expand research across full growing seasons to better understand the potential and testacross other commodities.,  ,,,,Jonathan  Jackson,,(937) 285-0990,jonj@g-neighbor.com,,  ,

Yearly LMB producers in the SoutheasternUS using traditional earthen ponds as the primary production unit are plagued by low survival slowgrowth poor food conversion ratio (FCR) losses to bird depredation water quality problems (i.e.low dissolved oxygen) and several disease issues. LMB producers believe these production-relatedobstacles inherent to culture in traditional earthen ponds have translated to reduced efficiency andprofitability of domestic LMB farming operations and are further inhibiting growth of thisaquaculture sector. The culture of LMB in a split-pond system (SPS) can ameliorate many of theinefficiencies documented by commercial LMB producers using traditional earthen pond systems.The proposed SPS for LMB has adapted SPS technology used by the US catfish industry to solvethe inherent limitations of low oxygen and waste treatment of traditional earthen ponds. The SPSconfines LMB to a smaller area (fish basin 15-20% of total pond area) in a pond. As a resultenergy-efficient aeration and water circulation are improved over the entire culture area. Theadvantages of the SPS for LMB production can revolutionize the production of this expanding foodfish species in the US.This project will evaluate the production performance water quality fishhealth metrics and the economic feasibility of raising LMB in SPS compared to traditional earthenponds.,  ,,,,Shawn  McNulty,,(334) 759-0023,shawn@americansportfish.com,,  ,

ALLVAR Alloys offer a brand-new strong and ductile support structure solution that can offer lower cost and lead time compared to legacy seeker telescopes, when combined SiC mirrors. The Phase I project modified the thermal expansion coefficient of ALLVAR’s commercially available Alloy 30 to reach the shortened lead time goal. This proposed Phase II project will buy down the risk associated with implementing this new alloy into seeker applications by collecting necessary material property data and beginning an incremental and iterative design, analysis, build, and test plan that includes thermal, shock, vibration, radiation, and optic performance testing. ALLVAR’s collaboration with Raytheon and Quartus Engineering, subcontractors on the project, identified 1) the acquisition of micro-creep, micro- yield, and basic material properties and 2) the design, building, and testing of an ALLVAR Alloy athermalized SiC primary mirror assembly under random vibration as the most important and highest risk elements to address in an incremental test plan. This Phase II project aims to address these highest risk next steps with the following Key Objectives: 1) Close quality and material property knowledge gaps for mirror holding, interfaces, and long-term stability of ALLVAR Alloys, 2) Design a multi-mirrored SiC telescope athermalized with ALLVAR Alloys, and 3) Fabricate and evaluate the performance of the telescope’s primary mirror mount in random vibration environmental conditions.

Project Summary
Farmers across the Texas High Plains and other arid regions in the United States face a perfect
storm with consistent periods of drought urban pressures on vital water resources and economic
hurdles. While climatic conditions create a barrier to production farmers face rising fuel and
input costs alongside growing inflation rates. These factors lead to more intensive and sometimes
destructive farming practices that limit the soil's ability to store water and life. Some farmers
turn to alternative practices such as no-till cover cropping and other regenerative techniques to
counter these pressures and limitations. These practices have proven to improve soil health and
water-holding capacityovertime. While there is growth in the adoption of these practices across
the United States arid regions like Texas Eastern New Mexico and Colorado face challenges in
transitioning due to:
â— Uniquely hot and dry conditions
â— Financial risk associated with the conversion and implementation of new practices
â— Limited access to regenerative soil amendments
Regenerative practices can change the composition and overall health of the soil but it isn't an
immediate or universally applicable solution for farmers. Smaller-scale gardeners and
landscapers have turned to peat moss forimmediateimprovement of water retention and soil
health. While peat moss does provide immediate soil amendments it is a nonrenewable resource
and its removal and exportation to other countries disrupt carbon sequestration in the bog
ecosystems (Timperley 2). Furthermore given its composition and price range there is no
efficient or economical way to apply peat on large cropping systems.
Under this research project Texas Earth Inc. will determine the commercial viability through
in-field trials of Bio Fl¼f a patent-pending soil biostimulant. Soil chemistry and structural testing
will quantify the impact of Bio Fl¼f on water-holding capacity metrics and overall plant and soil
health. Our team plans to deliver Bio Fl¼f as acommercially available andeffective soil
amendment that uniquely increases the soil's water-holding capacityespecially in thearid
regionsoftheUnitedStates. Bio Fl¼f is a natural cotton byproduct sustainably sourced and
highly scalable making it a perfect alternative to peat options. This in-season research will
provide farmers with a tool to stimulate biological functions encourage beneficial microbial
activities and improve water retention in the soil. Supporting soil health during dry growing
seasons will decrease overall energy and water consumption increasing farmer profitability
during water-deficient periods. Bio Fl¼f will provide a path for farmers to become more resilient
in the face of growing water scarcity whether they farm regeneratively or conventionally.",  ,,,,Sarah  Truesdell,,(325) 277-2893,info@texasearth.com,,  ,

The Air Carrier Access Act of 1986 (ACAA) ensured access to air travel for passengers with disabilities, including mandating equal or similar treatment in the screening process. This ACAA requirement comports with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) which prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, transporation, public accomodations, communications, and access to state and local government programs and services.Despite these requirements, due to technology limitations, screening practices for individuals with mobility limitations and disabilities currently involves an intrusive manual pat-down.Manual screening is much slower than the automated screening of passengers via non-ionizing radiation, and is particularly uncomfortable and intrusive for individuals requiring wheelchairs.. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to eliminate the disparity in screening processes between disabled and non-disabled passengers.In a Phase I SBIR, Analytical AI (AAI) proposed and demonstrated improvements automated screening of limited mobility passengers using passive TeraHertz (THz) technology by innovating on an Automated Threat Recognition (ATR) algorithm developed initially for full mobility passengers. For Phase II, AAI will transition this effort to work with active millimeter wave technology, which is more commonly in use within airport environments.

Antibiotic resistant Ng is an interconnected global threat to people, animals, and the environment. Furthermore, approximately 50% of all annual Ng infections in the US are drug-resistant1. The emergence of drug-resistant Ng is accelerating, and previous antibiotic treatments such as penicillin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, and cefixime are no longer recommended1, 2. A single recommended treatment remains – ceftriaxone. Current research suggests that it is the suppression of Th1 and Th2 responses by Ng, modulated by increased Th17 responses, which drives Ng infection and re-infection3-5. Protection from Ng is thought to benefit from a robust Th1 response or balanced Th1/Th2 response3, 6, 7. However, current Ng vaccination approaches mainly using aluminum salt do not induce appropriate Th1/2 responses, limiting vaccine efficacy4, 8, 9. A vaccine that generates a strong Th1, or a more balanced Th1/Th2 response, with robust mucosal immunity, would significantly enhance Ng vaccine efficacy. Current Ng vaccine approaches are mainly focused on developing novel parenteral vaccines4, 8. Parenteral vaccines are generally effective at stimulating systemic antibody-mediated immune responses but are less effective at inducing mucosal immunity10-12. Parenteral vaccines require significant resources for cold-chain management and administration, which translate into slow global vaccination. Since low- and middle-income countries have the highest Ng burden, new vaccines must support global delivery. Our project team brings together three innovative aspects and areas of expertise that will make a novel SL Ng vaccine a reality. First, we have identified novel Ng antigens expressed during natural mucosal infection that generate cross-reactive antibody responses. Second, our novel TLR4 agonist, INI-2005, induces robust systemic and mucosal immune response following SL administration. Third, INI-2005 demonstrates good synthesis and thermostability properties and appears safe. Building from this work, this application is designed to validate a SL Ng vaccine consisting of a novel SL adjuvant, INI-2005, and three unique Ng antigens identified from a reverse vaccinology-like approach. The specific aims of this Phase I SBIR application are to: 1) Produce and benchmark the TLR agonist and Ng antigens; 2) Determine the optimal SL formulation to maximize immune responses in mice; and 3) Demonstrate that the SL formulation effectively protects mice against Ng infection. Funding of this application will validate a SL vaccine to prevent Ng infection, designed for robust Th1 immune responses and mucosal immunity, administered easily, and thermostable for rapid, global distribution.",  ,,,,NEIL A FANGER,,2062281458,nfanger@virtici.com,,  ,

Identifying the attack profiles that will exploit a Cyber/EW vulnerability can be complex making them difficult to mitigate.  As a result, many existing and future software defined communications systems may be vulnerable to this new mode of electronic attack.   Secmation developed CyRF, a security analysis and testing tool which specifically targets these unique vulnerabilities in software defined communication systems such as Software Defined Radios (SDR). Originally developed for the Air Force Research Laboratory, CyRF uses a guided search method to identify communications signal parameters (e.g., frequency, phase, offset) which create candidate malicious signals that, when received by an SDR, will cause a software processing failure.  This software processing failure can lead to denial of communications to the warfighter or an exploitable vulnerability than can be used to affect the communications network.  This technology was recently granted a US Patent. CyRF uses a unique combination of signal and computational analytics to drive the search for vulnerabilities.  The search is implemented by a guided mutation fuzzer which targets the vulnerability search using metrics derived from the analytics.  CyRF focuses on finding software vulnerabilities in the Physical/Signal Processing Layer (Layer 1) and Data Link/Waveform Layer (Layer 2) as defined in the OSI model.  This “out of sight, out of mind” software is not regularly targeted by security researchers or security test plans. The proposed work will develop integrated computational and communication AI/ML based analytics which can drive a fuzzing framework to determine the security robustness of software defined communications. These robustness metrics will be used to identify possible regions of vulnerability in software defined communications and characteristics of malicious signals that can drive the receiver software into the regions of vulnerability.  The additional of AI/ML technology promises to find vulnerabilities quicker and be more rapidly adaptable to different types of SDR.  The technology will be demonstrated both in simulation and through Over the Air Testing (OTA) using commercial SDRs.",Waleed N Barnawi,Program Officer,7035882700,waleed.t.barnawi.civ@us.navy.mil,Hal  Aldridge,,9198872560,hal@secmation.com,,  ,

This device uses a ring-shaped anode to electrostatically trap electrons and increase their mean free path to favor gas ionization without using magnets. The ionized gas particles, including N2 and other noble gas, are then trapped into the getter-coated sidewalls.  This pump will be accompanied by a gas discharge pump that can operate across a broader pressure range. Neither the ring-Orbitron nor the gas-discharge pump require magnets nor moving parts to function; instead, they rely on electrical biasing which can be easily achieved without complex electronics. The proposed device also includes a cold atom cavity to measure pressure in the target UHV range as well as a graphite specimen to avoid loading the pump with Rubidium gas. The proposed device will be fabricated in phase II using silicon microfabrication technology, such that it will be highly compatible with silicon-based cavities.",Jon M Aspinwall III,Engineer,(202) 451-3638,Jon.Aspinwall@ssp.navy.mil,Benoit  Hamelin,,(678) 428-1843,benoit.hamelin@engeniusmicro.com,,  ,

Project Title: In vivo Gene Delivery to Regulatory T Cells to Drastically Reduce the Cost of Regulatory T Cell
Therapy
Organization: GigaMune Inc.
PI: David Johnson, Ph.D.
Over 9,000 patients will receive liver transplants this year, and about 75% of those patients will survive at least
5 years. Long term immune suppression is required for nearly all patients, but most immune suppressants (e.g.,
corticosteroids) are systemic rather than targeted. Immune suppressants lead to long-term toxicities such as
malignancy (5% incidence), lymphoproliferative disorder (3% incidence), and infections. About 50% of patients
never tolerate the transplant to the point where immune suppressants can be removed.
Adoptive cell therapies wherein chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or T cell receptors (TCRs) are engineered
into autologous T cells ex vivo have shown strong clinical efficacy and safety. Regulatory T cells engineered with
CARs (“CAR Tregs”) are a relatively new concept wherein CARs are used to direct antigen-specific immune
suppression. CAR-Tregs are under preclinical and clinical investigation for indications such as transplant and
autoimmunity, with the goal of inducing long-term tolerance without toxicities. However, the cost of manufacturing
cell therapies is hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient, driving total per-patient costs to up to $1 million
per patient.
Recent pioneering work used lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and lentivirus (LVs) to deliver CARs to T cells in vivo,
eliminating the need for manufacture of engineered cells ex vivo. GigaMune has developed a novel next-
generation lentivirus platform (GigaLentiTM) for in vivo delivery of CARs and TCRs specifically to T cells in vivo.
The Specific Aim of this Phase I SBIR project is to use in vitro models to assess the translational potential of
chimeric antigen receptor gene delivery to regulatory T cells for liver transplant tolerance, at drastically reduced
cost compared to conventional cell therapy.",  ,,,,DAVID S JOHNSON,,(415) 978-2101,info@gigamune.com,,  ,

To that end, Lynntech is developing a port- and pen-side diagnostic for field detection of transboundary pathogens. In this Phase II proposal we will develop an assay to detect three viruses of pigs not currently in the United States: African Swine Fever virus (ASFV), Classical Swine Fever virus (CSFV), and Foot and Mouth Disease virus (FMDV), we will further expand our assay to include Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) and Pseudorabies Virus (PRV). These five viruses can be transmitted through contaminated feed or importation of infected pigs. Introduction into the United States would devastate the American swine industry. Our assay will utilize nucleic acid amplification in a proprietary device which is portable and capable of battery operation. Utilizing nucleic acid amplification increases the sensitivity of our proposed assay. Our assay will not use fluorescent dyes for detection but rather a visual means, reducing the equipment requirements and the need for trained personnel to interpret results. The proposed work will develop the system then validate the specificity of our assay toward viral nucleic acids and multiplex the detection against multiple viruses.

Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) is a perennialnitrogen-fixing legume with tremendous potential benefits to soil health environmental healthand contribution to animal and human nutrition. As one of the world's oldest domesticated foragecrops alfalfa is grown on six continents and is the fourth most important economic crop in theUnited States. Traits such as higher yields stress tolerance and biomass quality (improveddigestibility and nutrient composition) have been targeted by alfalfa breeders to benefit farmerscattle growers and beef/dairy industries. Although numerous breeding and biotechnology effortshave aimed to improve such traits traditional genetic improvement techniques such as constitutivegene silencing methods have had negative consequences when applied to commercial crops. Forexample improving forage quality by lowering lignin often resulted in plants with poor structuralintegrity and diminished biomass yield at maturity. This proposed SBIR Phase I research projectdevelops an efficient approach to fine-tune lignin biosynthesis and biomass composition whileincreasing biomass yields in alfalfa. Moreover an additional feed quality trait enabled by ourgenetic engineering strategy towards mitigating enteric methane emissions has the potential toimprove the sustainability of meat and milk production. Our molecular metabolic and phenotypiccharacterizations of these new engineered alfalfa lines generated in Phase I will represent valuablematerial for 1) future verification at greenhouse/field environments and 2) trait transfer into elitegermplasms via licensing and breeding. If the project demonstrates the abovementioned goals inalfalfa this new biotechnology platform could be applied to other perennial forage/pasture speciesthat currently cover 121.1 million acres in the United States (6% of the U.S. surface area).,  ,,,,Ai  Oikawa,,(510) 290-8845,aoikawa@afingen.tech,,  ,

In this Phase II effort Estes Energetics will develop a pilot-scale production line that can be modularly expanded to greater potassium nitrate production rates and to other critical nitrates. The Phase II effort will scale up the process developed in Phase I to a pilot scale production line capable of producing approximately 160,000-250,000 pounds per year. Our plan includes several risk management approaches. The two process steps we identify as having the greatest technical risk are the crystallization step and the chlorine gas processing step. To mitigate these risks, we will first focus our efforts on the design and scale-up of the latter half of the process (acid-based reaction of potassium hydroxide, followed by crystallization and drying). We will refer to this as Phase A. Potassium hydroxide can be purchased commercially in the US, so we can initially operate the pilot plant using potassium hydroxide as an input instead of potassium chloride. This intermediate process step also eliminates generating chlorine gas and thus the requirement for chlorine gas processing. The first technical objective is to demonstrate production of potassium nitrate from industrially relevant domestic sources of potassium chloride and nitric acid at a pilot scale (hundreds of thousands of pounds per year). The second technical objective is to ensure that the potassium nitrate being synthesized is compliant with MIL-DTL-156. The third technical objective is to demonstrate the operation of the pilot line at an operationally-relevant pace and economically viable manner, as determined by the throughput target set during the preliminary design task. Completion of these objectives will align well with the desired deliverables outlined in discussions with stakeholders. The focus in Phase II will be scaling up the Phase I process to an operationally relevant scale that can be modularly expanded to a throughput of several million pounds per year. The expected end result is a clear demonstration of a pilot-scale production process that can produce MIL-DTL-156 compliant potassium nitrate at an operationally-relevant scale and in an economically viable manner.",Vaibhav  Jain,R&D Program Manager,(571) 767-8839,Vaibhav.Jain@dla.mil,Michael  Siirila,,(612) 816-9580,msiirila@estesenergetics.com,,  ,

State of the art field-detection kits for animal diseases consist mainly of ELISA test kits and PCR devices. However, both these techniques can only test for a single disease per test, thus screening for multiple diseases requires separate test kits and test iterations, thus neither is not conducive to high-throughput testing, and costs increase with the number of tests performed. Further, ELISA can lack accuracy and, depending on kit design, require time-consuming sample preparation and results can be difficult to interpret.

Compared to current labor-intensive field testing, this project’s outputs will offer scene characterization at comparable, or better, levels of detail, while surmounting the time, cost, and accessibility constraints that have historically precluded comprehensive and repetitive monitoring. Accomplishment of these Phase II goals will yield a user-friendly land cover mapping system that will enable high-resolution environmental monitoring.

immunity in these models. In this Phase 1 application we propose to establish the efficacy of oral delivery of HC-
C in a chronic house dust mite (HDM) murine model of allergic lung inflammation (Aim 1), and further explore
mechanism by testing the effects of HC-C on signaling and function of human airway smooth muscle (HASM)
cells and human airway epithelial (HAE) cells in primary culture (Aim 2). Aim 1 will assess the dose-dependent
effect of orally administered HC-C on HDM-induced lung inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway
remodeling. Aim 2 will assess the dose-dependent effect of HC-C on pro-contractile signaling and cellular
contraction of HASM in cultures derived from asthmatic and nonasthmatic donors. HAE cultures, also derived
from asthmatic and nonasthmatic donors, will be used to test the dose-dependent effect of HC-C on IL-13-
induced cytokine, mucus production, and transcriptome regulation. Collectively, these studies will accomplish
important preclinical goals, advancing proof-of-concept, and insight into mechanism, and justify the
manufacturing of HC-C for Investigational New Drug Application (IND)-enabling non-clinical studies for filing an

Ranging from simple Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) that convey ownership to complex, self-executing agreements that automate future payments, smart contracts are at the heart of the commercial utility and perceived value of a blockchain. Growing numbers of financial institutions are seeking to advance their Web3 capabilities, even at premium prices. As algorithmic trading has demonstrated, automating analysis and execution can provide enormous commercial upside, yet it also can result in large losses if designed improperly or left unchecked. Pioneering a solution that enables enterprises without advanced programmers to reap the benefits of analyzing and writing smart contracts while managing the associated risks requires deep technology— specifically a novel visual programming language designed to manage big-data sets involving millions of smart contracts on public blockchains using simple no-code commands._x000D_

This SBIR Phase 1 project proposes to build a unique blockchain application interface that will enable users to scan and read smart contracts and immediately leverage the extracted data to design, build, and test trading algorithms that incorporate digital assets. This interface will ultimately enable users to analyze and write smart contracts at scale without the need to code. The project will set the foundation for the inexpensive development of Web3 capabilities by thousands of enterprises that do not have access to advanced programmers. The project will also produce a computerized tool that does the following two key tasks:1. continuously scan publicly-accessible smart contracts in real time, and 2.derive indicators from these scanned contracts that likely are meaningful, initially for the purposes of analyzing and trading financial assets. The blockchain application interface to be created will enable users without programming capabilities to automate trading using live smart contract data for the first time._x000D_

We propose a novel holistic paradigm to help solve the opioid crisis by using proteome scale deep learning
approaches to design optimal nonaddictive analgesics. We will design compounds that target speciﬁc proteins
and pathways the combine the pain relieving effects of long acting drugs such as methadone and buprenorphine
while modulating additional interactions to ensure optimal pharmacological extinction in reward systems via drugs
like naloxone and naltrexone. The proteins to be targeted will be determined by multiscale analytics of current
drugs with additional expert information, resulting in desired objective proteomes (i.e., the subset of proteins with
which a designed drug candidate should interact with for optimal efﬁcacy and minimal side effects) for relieving
pain without addiction. The drugs designed to these objectives will be synthesized and validated using binding
and animal studies in Phase I, and the most promising candidates will be leads for continued drug development
in Phase II with the eventual goals of clinical trials and regulatory approval. Our paradigm is broadly applicable
to design drug candidates to help alleviate the opioid crisis.
We developed the Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Repurposing Opportunities (CANDO) platform for shot-
gun multitarget drug discovery, repurposing, and design, funded in part by a NIH Director’s Pioneer Award to
overcome the limitations of traditional single target approaches. The open source platform screens and ranks
drugs/compounds for every disease/indication (and adverse event) through large scale modeling and analytics of
interactions between comprehensive libraries of drugs/compounds and protein structures. The interactions are
determined using a variety of molecular docking and scoring protocols. CANDO implements a variety of bench-
marking protocols for shotgun repurposing, i.e., to determine how every known drug is related to every other in
the context of the indications/diseases for which they are approved, which enables evaluation of various pipelines
and protocols within and external to the platform for their utility in drug discovery. The multiple fast and accurate
interaction scoring/docking protocols, the proteomic scale, and rigorous all-against-all benchmarking used within
the platform make it unique and ideal for the design of chemical entities that target a desired proteomic space
or objective. Speciﬁcally our aims are to: (i) Create enhanced objective interaction signatures/networks
describing pain and addiction. (ii) Apply deep learning pipelines to generate and rank drug designs in
the context of desired proteomic/interactomic objectives. (iii) Validate the top designs using binding and
animal studies. Overall, our goal is to perform analytics of all drugs/compounds within CANDO to design optimal
proteomic nonaddictive analgesic objectives that are synthesized and preclinically validated. The most potent de-
signs will be pursued further by our company for drug development and regulatory approval via a Phase II award,
venture capital and/or industry partnerships.",  ,,,,WILLIAM T MANGIONE,,(716) 803-5515,wmangion@buffalo.edu,UNIVERSITY OF BUFFALO FOUNDATION,  ,

This project addresses excessing heating in electronic devices by introducing new high-performance thermal interface materials based upon embedding liquid metal droplets inside of stretchable polymers. These so-called liquid metal embedded elastomer (LMEE) materials can be applied to computer processors, graphics cards, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chips, and even power modules in electric vehicles, to help keep electronic devices operating at peak performance at all times. The growing prevalence of the Internet of Things, 5G network infrastructure, and electric cars all necessitate better thermal solutions so that devices can function properly.

_x000D_
This project’s goal is to develop and commercialize a thermal interface material (TIM) for packaged microelectronics, building upon the LMEE composite architecture.The technology will outperform existing TTIMs by combining the superior thermal resistance of metal-based solid TIMs (S-TIMs) with the mechanical reliability of polymer-based TIMs and the high-volume manufacturing compatibility of thermal greases.Specifically, LMEEs possess a unique combination of metal-like thermal resistance, rubber-like elasticity, and liquid emulsion-like rheology prior to curing, thereby solving two main challenges present with existing S-TIMs: (i) poor mechanical reliability over long durations and (ii) incompatibility with syringe-based dispensing for high volume manufacturing.The strategy proposed in this project is to synthesize an LMEE-based TIM that forms a robust bond between the surfaces of the semiconductor chip and surrounding enclosure, maintains a controlled thickness between the chip and enclosure, and ensures the necessary rheology for syringe-based dispensing.Specific project tasks build around a comprehensive technical plan that includes materials synthesis, performance characterization, and in-package evaluation.In parallel, the project will examine methods for storage, shipment, and dispensing to ensure a product that is ready for integrated device manufacturers and semiconductor assembly and testing industry by the end of this project._x000D_

HTV is a non-rocket technology that solves performance limitations of in-space rocket thrusters. HTV offers reusable and economically sustainable orbital space debris removal solutions across all earth operational orbits. This proposal addresses the space debris problem not caused by operational satellites, but from non-maneuverable objects and debris in the highly populated Sun Synchronous Orbits (SSO). Historically, SSO space objects have contributed to technical, societal, and scientific advancements. The potential outcome of HTV research is a viable and reusable technology for cost-effective orbit object disposal in high value SSO with clean Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP). Instead of expelling propellant, HTV rotates a working fluid gas inside a toroidal cavity to generate a usable force. HTV torus structure draws in the gas while mounted inside an ambient pressure enclosure, which is separate from the vacuum of space. HTV generates a reactive force by employing the Conservation of Angular Momentum (CAM). CAM is preserved when HTV fluid angular momentum (H) and rotational energy (Trot) change. This project will demonstrate with experimental measurements an external force by using air as the working fluid gas, while satisfying CAM._x000D_

Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease and has been designated as a research priority by NIAID and an SBIR Research Topic of Interest. Six million individuals are infected and 8,000 deaths were caused by Chagas in 2015 in mostly Central and South America by advanced forms of the disease such as Chagas hemorrhagic fever. The cost associated with Chagas disease treatment globally is estimated to be ~$7 billion. Chagas disease is caused by the parasitic protist Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) and spread by Triatominae, or ""kissing bugs"". While endemic in South America, it is spread to people living elsewhere due to immigration of infected patients and travel to endemic regions. No vaccine is currently available and the only drugs used to treat Chagas, the nitro aryl compounds nifurtimox and benznidazole, lose effectiveness in the chronic phase as the parasite develops resistance, and they cause limiting adverse events as well. New medications acting via novel mechanisms are urgently needed to eliminate the parasite in chronic patients suffering and dying from Chagas disease. Novel compounds synthesized at Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center (FCCDC) have been tested at multiple collaborator sites: GSK Tres Cantos Open Lab Foundation in Tres Cantos, Spain; New York University; University Of Dundee, Scotland; and the Swiss Tropical Public Health Institute, all research facilities dedicated to curing neglected tropical diseases. The analogs tested displayed excellent activity against the T. cruzi parasite in both its replicative (amastigote) and infective (trypomastigote) forms as found in phenotypic screening assays. The compounds do not act through any known mechanism of action and display little to no toxicity to host cells, unlike the standards of care nifurtimox and benznidazole. Further, in vivo testing in a murine model for Chagas disease (NYU) confirmed potent antiparasitic activity. The lead compounds are proprietary to FCCDC and a provisional U.S. patent application has been filed. The activity seen for the series has generated great interest at the non-profit Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi). DNDi evaluates many potential international collaborations each year but only selects the most promising for resource investment. Following evaluation of our project, DNDi has committed additional T. cruzi testing gratis at both the University of Dundee and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in order to evaluate potency and investigate mechanism of action. Our Aims to develop this chemotype from lead compound to preclinical candidate is (1) Optimize the potency by exploring the SAR of our novel lead using iterative medicinal chemistry synthesi, (2) characterize the biochemical properties of the compounds to optimize antiparasitic activity (NYU, DNDi), and (3) perform in vivo tests in acute and chronic Chagas disease mouse models (NYU) as well as evaluate and improve ADME properties of advanced leads as required.

Project Summary
Severe asthma is a potentially lethal disease that is not fully controlled by anti-inflammatory small molecule or
biologic therapies. Recent evidence indicates that severe asthma patients exhibit substantial airway remodeling
(AR) where the epithelial, goblet and smooth muscle cells adopt atypical phenotypes that lead to airway
restriction with airway tissue thickening and fibrosis, smooth muscle mass expansion (SMR), mucus
accumulation and airway hyper reactivity to irritants. These tissue remodeling changes are not responsive to
standard of care anti-inflammatory (small molecule or biologic) or airway relaxing agents. SMR masses are
responsive to ablation by bronchial thermoplasty and clinical improvements are documented suggesting that
reducing SMR is a novel means to control severe asthma. Recent studies indicate that the Ca2+ release-activated
Ca2+ (CRAC) channel is a critical driver of SMR and that inhibition of CRAC could control SMR. Vivreon
Biosciences is pursuing a novel approach to deliver a novel and potent CRAC modulator development candidate
locally to the airways to obtain maximal tissue distribution and efficacy to control SMR. Other orally delivered,
systemically active CRAC blockers showed efficacy in models of asthma by inhibiting the inflammatory mediators
of the disease. Vivreon will surpass these early successes via intranasal delivery to achieve maximal local
delivery to the tissue to reduce both SMR and local inflammation.
The CRAC pathway regulates many genes through activation of NFAT and NF-B transcriptional activity. These
attributes make the CRAC channel a suitable target for development of a drug that can suppress SMR and
inflammation that drives severe asthma. Vivreon’s experimental therapeutic exhibits sub nanomolar potency at
CRAC and a favorable safety profile (no CYP inhibition, acceptable off-target activity profile, no evidence of
cardiac ion channel inhibition) upon oral dosing. In this SBIR Phase 1 project we will confirm in vitro activity
against airway smooth muscle cell and leukocyte production of proinflammatory mediators. In Aim 2 we will
confirm achievement of lung tissue levels that exceed CRAC IC50 values following intranasal administration. We
will also monitor plasma exposure in this experiment to appreciate the potential for systemic activity with this
dosing regimen. In Aim 3 we will quantify the efficacy and dose response of our CRAC modulator delivered by
the intranasal route (confirmed in Aim 2) on the SMR process and smooth muscle mass, as well as inflammatory
processes, in a model of asthma. Successful completion of these Aims will position the program to advance
further into IND-enabling studies such as formulation and inhaler delivery optimization, advanced toxicology
testing, chemistry scale up and dose-range finding with Phase II SBIR funding and other external support.",  ,,,,MILTON L GREENBERG,,(301) 602-6875,milton@vivreonbiosciences.com,,  ,

The technical innovation at the core of this proposal is to improve the yield and reduce the cost of extracting mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) from a complex mixture of compounds contained within cyanobacterial cells (or other MAA producing organisms). Small volumes of MAAs are currently obtained using expensive and hazardous solvents and expensive equipment. The innovation is focused on the use of synthetic nucleotides (aptamers) to selectively bind to the MAAs and purify them from a cell lysate. Mycosporine-like amino acids arose on early Earth to protect microbes from harmful UV radiation. Their prevalence and longevity substantiate their value in protecting cells from UV radiation and other forms of oxidative stress. Their presence in the Earth’s oceans for millennia speaks to their safety in marine ecosystems and suggests their safety for use on human skin; Safety will be verified using standard pre-clinical tests. Technical hurdles include the isolation and identification of the specific MAAs produced, identifying aptamers that are highly specific for the MAAs produced, determining MAA yield from several purification processes and assessing process scalability. These data will be compared to other isolation techniques (filtration and chromatography) to assess comparative yields and economic performance._x000D_

Foot ulceration is the most common and costly late complication of diabetes, with morbidity and mortality being
worse than many cancers. It is estimated that up to one-third of people with diabetes will develop a diabetic foot
ulcer (DFU) in their lifetime. Non-healing DFUs are a leading cause of hospitalization, amputation, disability, and
death among people with diabetes. In the United States, one-third of all diabetes-related costs are spent on
diabetic foot care, with two-thirds of the costs incurred in inpatient settings, constituting a substantial economic
burden to society. Therefore, every means possible should be used to try to heal DFU and prevent amputation.
In this regard, there is a significant body of evidence related to the clinical benefits of exercise for people with
DFU, including improving blood flow and oxygen supply, muscle loss prevention, and joint mobility. Despite this
evidence, exercise is not part of the standard care for wound healing, mainly as there is no solution for promoting
and managing home-based exercise programs for people with DFU.
In this Phase I SBIR project, we will design an interactive foot and ankle exercise program for people with DFU
using wearable sensors called Tele-FootX™. Tele-FootX will enable both remotely and virtually supervised
evidence-based foot and ankle exercises and allow clinicians to educate, monitor, and coach patients. The
gaming features of the platform will promote adherence to the prescribed exercise programs, and, subsequently,
wound healing. This approach is supported by our proof-of-concept study, where we demonstrated the benefit
of interactive foot and ankle exercises to improve lower extremity perfusion and increase activity in the calf
muscle. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1, we will design an interactive game-based exercise platform using foot-
mounted sensors and make it suitable for people with DFU by including game-based exercises inspired by the
Buerger-Allen exercise program. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate the acceptability, feasibility, safety, and proof of
concept effectiveness of the Tele-FootX in improving lower extremity perfusion by recruiting 15 participants with
DFU. We will examine the perceived benefit, ease of use, technology acceptance, usability, and technology
anxiety from the point of view of the 15 participants with DFU recruited in Aim 2, as well as 10 health care
professionals with expertise in DFU management.
In Phase II, we will introduce new gaming features to improve engagement, as well as features for clinicians to
educate, manage and personalize the home-based exercise program for each patient. We will also integrate the
proposed solution into existing hospital records and remote assessments (e.g., EPIC). We will validate the final
product in a 12-week randomized control trial. There are existing CPT codes that cover tele-exercise programs.
The existence of reimbursement codes (CPT codes 98975, 98977, 98980, and 98981), the large size of the
market (26.1 million worldwide develop DUF annually), and the significant clinical benefits of the proposed
solution will facilitate commercialization of Tele-FootX.",  ,,,,ASHKAN  VAZIRI,,(888) 589-6213,ashkan.vaziri@biosensics.com,,  ,

Long-term medical care expense for stroke in the US, costs over $34B per year. Large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke accounts for almost 40% of ischemic strokes but causes 95% of mortality and 62% of long-term dependence. Mechanical thrombectomy (MT), or a combination of MT and tPA, has emerged as standard of care treatment of LVO stroke. Up to 60% of thrombectomy patients are first evaluated at spoke hospitals and transferred to hub hospitals for MT. `Time is brain' following stroke, the sooner therapy can be instituted, the greater the likelihood of preserving neurological function. A therapy that could be rapidly deployed in all stroke patients to preserve the brain could provide enormous potential benefit to stroke patients. NanO2TM (aka dodecafluoropentane emulsion, DDFPe) significantly decreased stroke volume (SV), by about 85%, and improved neurological assessment score (NAS) in rabbits when administered IV up to 3 hours following stroke and also improved SV and NAS in permanent rat MCAo. In a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase Ib/II clinical trial of acute ischemic stroke, in which patients receive standard reperfusion therapy, NanO2 was safe at all dose levels. The higher doses of NanO2 caused significantly better modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 30 and 90-days post stroke. Early administration of NanO2 (<5 hours from onset) presented with significantly better NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores. NanO2 is active at very low doses (e.g. 0.1 to 0.17 mL of 2% w/vol emulsion per kg body weight) and clears via exhalation with a terminal half-life of about 90 minutes in humans. NanO2 was previously tested as an ultrasound contrast agent in 2,230 patients and was considered safe and approvable by the FDA and EMEA. The Specific Aims are 1) to manufacture DDFPe GMP for SPAN studies and to scale-up GMP manufacturing, 2) to test drug in tMCAo models in lean, adult and aged Wistar rats and 3) to perform studies in obese, diabetic Zucker rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats. Expected Outcome: NanO2 will show great efficacy in rodent tMCAo models enabling this drug to be considered as a candidate for entry into clinical trials in ischemic stroke sponsored by StrokeNet.",  ,,,,EVAN C UNGER,,5209771210,eunger@nuvoxpharma.com,,  ,

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a leading cause of preventable hospital death in the US resulting in greater
than 100,000 deaths annually. Advanced age, surgery, cancer, immobilization, and hospitalization are common
causes of VTE. Overall, 20% of all VTE cases occurs in patients who have cancer. VTE was also a significant
predictor of mortality during the first year of diagnosis in patients with all types of cancer. Not only the risk of VTE
is high in the hospitalized patients because of long immobility, its risk remains elevated up to 3 months after
discharge. VTE is also highly prevalent among COVID-19 patients even after the hospital discharge.
Current methods of prophylaxis for VTE have significant limitations. For instance, the use of pharmacologic
prophylaxis is mostly limited to the inpatient setting, due to increased rates of bleeding complications. Current
non-pharmacological interventions are inefficient due to lack of compliance, impracticality for in-home care, cost,
and supervision requirements especially in elderly population.
To address the limitations described above STEXOLE LLC is partnered with Baylor College of Medicine (BCM)
to design and commercialize an innovative tele-medicine-based smart sock named Tele-SOX. This device
includes three major components: 1) Sensor-Exergame: a patented interactive game- based foot and ankle
exercise program based on a wearable sensor, which will be integrated into the sock and enables delivering
personalized game-based lower extremity exercise, ensuring improving venous return and prevention of VTE;
2) a series of adjustable weights add-on to socks to personalized resistive exercise; 3) tele- medicine: a
mobile application installable on a tablet or a smart phone enables interaction with care providers as well as
guiding patients to execute effective and personalized exercise tasks and gamification features to engage
patient and remind him/her for recommended dosage of needed exergame per day.
The scientific premise of the proposed platform relies on our initial study demonstrating effectiveness of the
proposed exergame program on increasing venous blood flow volume on average by 49% after just 3-minute
interactive and virtually supervised repetitive foot and ankle exercise, while reducing hospital acquired weakness.
During Phase I, the initial platform will be improved to make it suitable for home-based use and non-tech savvy
users (Aim 1). In addition, the proof of concept of the platform will be assessed in a convenient sample of 15
geriatric oncology inpatients (age 50+) to demonstrate its feasibility and proof of concept efficacy to improve
venous-return flow in response to 3-5 min usage of the device (Aim 2). Finally, by interviewing recruited
participants and 15 clinical experts unaffiliated with the project, we will assess perception of benefit and ease of
use. After successful achievement of the milestones of the Phase I, During Phase II, the gaming interface will
be further developed (more games, inter-connectivity of patients), and will be tested for its effectiveness to reduce
risk of VTE, improve mobility, reduce readmission risk, and enhancing the quality of life.",  ,,,,ROSHA  JOSHI,,(832) 648-8377,rosha@texasense.com,,  ,

BioTherapeutics, Inc (BTI) is an emerging biotech company that synergistically combines the power of
advanced computational modeling with translational experimentation to accelerate the development of novel
products for precision medicine and health.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and disabling inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract
that afflicts 2 million Americans and over 5 million people worldwide. Current therapeutics are unsuccessful in
maintaining remission and have been linked to serious side effects. BTI recently uncovered a novel chemical
family that inhibits IL-18, an inflammatory cytokine produced by epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract to
activate differentiation of IFNγ-producing Th1 cells and polarization of inflammatory macrophages. Our prototype
NCE significantly reduced colonic scores and Th1 in the colonic lamina propria after DSS challenge and in the
spontaneous Mdr1a-/- model of colitis, consistent with the proposed IL-18-blocking mechanism. This project will
further characterize mechanisms of IL-18 signaling in IBD and validate the therapeutic efficacy of IL-18 inhibition
in vivo and in human primary cells.
The Specific Aims for this SBIR Phase I application are to:
AIM 1. Evaluate the relative therapeutic efficacy of IL-18 inhibitors in vitro. We will assess the potency of
IL-18 inhibition through binding and functional assays.
AIM 2. Determine the therapeutic potential of IL-18 inhibition in mouse models of IBD. We will use the
CD45RBhi adoptive transfer and DSS models of colitis to characterize the in vivo dose response to IL-18 inhibition
through histological, transcriptional and immunological assays.
AIM 3. Validate the responsiveness of in human UC patient cells to IL-18 signaling and inhibition. We
will examine responses of healthy and UC PBMCs and LPMCs to IL-18 exposure and pharmacological inhibition.
Expected successful outcomes will include: i) ≥ 50% reduction of IFNγ production in response to IL-18 after
treatment in vitro; ii) ≥ 70% reduction of histological scores in adoptive transfer and DSS models of colitis; and
iii) ≥ 50% reduction in IFNγ production in human UC PBMCs with IL-18 inhibition.
The SBIR Phase II application will determine exposure-response relationships in therapeutic efficacy of IL-18
inhibition in chronic colitis models, conduct pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety studies in rats, evaluate the drug
metabolism and off-target effects, and further validate the role of IL-18 as a therapeutic target in human UC and
Crohn’s disease (CD).
The long-term goal of this project is to develop a novel immunomodulatory therapeutic that is safer and more
effective for treating IBD and provide a path towards commercialization of an asset with a target patient
population of over 5 million with unmet clinical needs and a growing therapeutic market of $16 billion.",  ,,,,ANDREW  LEBER,,(540) 218-2262,ajleber@biotherapeuticsinc.com,,  ,

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project will build on an innovative technology for non-invasive, transabdominal measurement of fetal arterial blood oxygen saturation (fSpO2). The underlying principle of operation is shining light in the abdominal area of the pregnant mother at two specific near infrared wavelengths, followed by sensing the small amount of diffusely-scattered light on the maternal abdomen. The relative concentration of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the pulsating fetal blood regulates light absorption by the fetal tissue, resulting in a faint pattern in the sensed light signals. The sensed signals are analyzed to detect such patterns, and to infer fSpO2. The project activities include further revisions of the device prototype and collaboration with a team of clinical researchers to demonstrate safe and accurate transabdominal fSpO2 measurement in a pilot patient study.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse indicates that “there are more deaths, illness, and disabilities from
substance use than from any other preventable health condition.” In SUDs, and particularly opioid use disorder
(OUD), individuals frequently experience uncontrolled craving symptoms, even receiving treatment under a
supervised medication for OUD program (MOUD, also known as MAT) including supportive psychotherapy and
peer recover services. In addition, individuals with SUDs are noted to have impairments in self-control
cognitive processes. We propose to address cravings burden and to strengthen momentary (seconds/minutes
range) self-control processing by delivering an adjunctive solution, “BoostPrime”, as a smartphone-based
software intervention for craving support, incorporating novel cognitive training exercises. With multiple lines of
preliminary research establishing Boost platform cognitive training effects and symptomatic benefit for high
utilizers, and indicating viability for clinical deployment commercially, we will now: refine the operator interface
and system design to accommodate utilization-enhancing strategies for patients and providers; and engage the
FDA to inform regulated development and validation plans. In Phase II we will conduct large-scale human
testing of platform variants to inform an optimal utilization-enhancement strategy (i.e., an adaptive model)
which will be tested in a pivotal study of patients receiving MOUD treatment support in an outpatient setting; for
craving benefits and momentary self-control improvements. Activities will culminate in De Novo submission of
the BoostPrime digital therapeutic package to the FDA, as an adjunctive treatment for cravings in OUD.",  ,,,,SALIL  PATEL,,(781) 472-1140,salil@nxtech.co,,  ,

Aeton Therapeutics is developing inhibitors of cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase)—a pattern recognition receptor
that activates STING and results in the production of interferon (IFN)-β—as novel therapies for the treatment of
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD is the most common form of late-onset dementia and affects nearly 50 million
people worldwide and an estimated 5.7 million Americans. In 2020, total payments for healthcare, long‐term
care, and hospice services for people aged 65 and older with dementia were estimated to be $305 billion. The
cognitive decline associated with AD correlates with the formation of amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary
tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain. Aeton Therapeutics seeks to produce a novel
therapeutic for AD by developing cGAS inhibitors (cGASi’s). cGAS is a cytosolic DNA sensing protein that has
been linked to a number of neurodegenerative and inflammatory diseases. Upon sensing DNA in the cytosol
(due to the presence of pathogens, genomic/mitochondrial damage, or other pathological mechanisms), cGAS
catalyzes ATP/GTP coupling to produce 2’3’-cGAMP, a potent ligand of STING, resulting in the production of
IFN-β. Previous studies suggest that cGAS is aberrantly activated in a tauopathy mouse model, resulting in an
IFN response and neurotoxic chronic neuroinflammation. In contrast, genetic ablation of cGAS in PS19 mice,
which overexpress P301S mutant tau and develop tau pathology and cognitive deficits, protects against those
cognitive deficits and the loss of hippocampal synapses. These findings strongly support the development of
cGASi’s to protect against the negative effects of cGAS-STING hyperactivation, but existing compounds exhibit
only modest potency in inhibiting the cGAS-STING pathway in human THP1 myeloid cells. To develop novel
cGASi’s to treat tau-mediated neurodegeneration in AD, in this Phase I project, Aeton Therapeutics proposes
the following aims: Aim 1. Develop potent h-cGASi’s via medicinal chemistry of virtual hits 1 and 2. We
have identified promising hits via a virtual screen. We will perform optimization and in vitro assessment of h-
analogs to identify lead candidates. Aim 2. Determine PK, target engagement, and efficacy of h-cGASi’s in
human iPSC-derived microglia and organoid model. The two best leads showing high brain exposure will be
assessed in PK studies in wild-type mice and evaluated in human iPSC-derived microglia and organoids. Lead
h-cGASi’s must reduce key biomarkers, such as Cxcl4, Ifnb, and TBK1/pTBK1. We expect to identify at least
one lead h-cGASi that reduces key biomarkers in cells and organoids, is brain permeable, shows no toxicity in
mice, and does not have off-target effects. This will lead to development of novel cGASi’s that are likely to
reprogram toxic microglial responses and protect against tau-related cognitive decline.",  ,,,,ANJANA  SINHA,,(858) 353-6917,anjanasinha5819@gmail.com,,  ,

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The proposed project will address a preeminent public health challenge that is acute and immediate:
developing innovative commercial digital solutions to positively affect fundamental risk factors associated with
health disparities and social determinants of health (SDOH) experienced by communities afflicted with
substance use disorder (SUD). With an alarming 81,000 overdose deaths recorded in the 12 months ending on
May 2020, it is clear that the current national opioid epidemic is being accelerated and worsened by the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As these dual health emergencies collide, communities that are negatively
impacted by health disparities remain disproportionately at higher risk for substance use disorders. At the
same time, ensuring sufficient and equitable access to SUD prevention and treatment services remains a
significant challenge, and few if any tools exist to provide actionable business and public health intelligence
needed by different SUD stakeholders, including government agencies, corporate employers, and technology
companies, about where and what types of prevention and treatment services are needed. In response, this
project will conceptualize, develop and pilot test a multimodal digital tool that will create a comprehensive
nationwide database of SUD treatment facilities, combined with an analytical health disparities data layer that
can enable SUD-related intelligence. The tool will generate actionable insights on where SUD treatment
capacity is insufficient and in turn reduce health disparities related to improving access to SUD treatment
specific to priority minority populations and underserved communities. The project will use technology
approaches in big data, predictive modeling, and custom data visualization and has the following project aims:Milestone 1: Use advanced methods of data mining to identify and collate a national SUD treatmentfacility database that includes specific community and business characteristics of interest;Milestone 2: Join, integrate, and analyze SUD treatment facility data with existing demographic,economic, social, and health disparity-related data to enable identification of communities at highest risk ofhealth-related SUDs including a specific focus on identifying communities with insufficient treatmentaccess; andMilestone 3: Build a web-hosted MVP data visualization solution to enable actionable public health andbusiness intelligence identifying SUD health disparity treatment access risks and target use of the solutionfor customer segments including government agencies, corporate employers, and technology companies.
This is a critical opportunity to directly address health disparities related to SUD by developing an innovative
digital tool that can help ensure sufficient access to prevention and treatment services in communities who
have the greatest need.",  ,,,,TIMOTHY K MACKEY,,(951) 491-4161,tmackey@s-3.io,,  ,

The ZEV transition is the primary solution to the decarbonization of the transportation sector, which is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the US. The project focuses on transit agencies, with the ultimate goal of lowering both operating costs and capital costs of their ZEV fleets. Coupled with the current funding support by federal, state and local governments to transit agencies to purchase ZEVs, this project could accelerate the decarbonization of the US transit fleet. A 50% transition of the US transit fleet to ZEVs will reduce nearly 200 million metric tons of carbom dioxide (CO2) equivalent, providing cleaner air quality and reducing urban noise pollution, particularly in low-income communities that rely more heavily on transit services for their transportation needs. The addressable market of Transportation Management Systems will grow from $8.8 billion in 2020 to $27.48 billion in 2028. Demonstrating success in the transit segment will enable the replication of this approach to other fleet segments like school bus fleets, last-mile and mid-mile delivery fleets, and long-haul trucking fleets. _x000D_
_x000D_
The intellectual merit of this project is the design and implementation of an artificial intelligence software platform to automatically learn predictive vehicle models of transit ZEVs and provide recommendation services to transit agencies. The Phase II project has three integrated goals.The first goal is the development of energy prediction algorithms which are scalable and highly accurate. Transit ZEV fleets have stochastic load changes, high sensitivity to operator driving style and high variation of battery size, weight and driving range, even for similar vehicles. These challenges will be addressed by developing automated learning techniques built on algorithms developed in Phase I, which use contextualized data from ZEV stops and trips. The second goal is to validate the prediction accuracy via pilots with ZEV fleets providing scheduled bus services.The final goal is development of real-time, scalable, fleet optimization algorithms which optimize daily assignment and charge management of ZEV fleets. Chance-constrained optimization will be merged with predictive control theory to address scalability and real-time performance of the resulting optimization algorithms. These recommendations will, if successful, demonstrate highly accurate predictions of charge usage, a substantial increase in ZEV fleet utilization, and a reduction of transit ZEV fleet operating costs._x000D_

In this project, we will further develop our optimized CaMKII inhibitor peptide tatCN19o as a cerebroprotective stroke treatment through comparative testing within the NINDS Stroke Preclinical Assessment Network (SPAN). The 30 amino-acid peptide is selective, stable, potent, water soluble, and has excellent chemistry, manufacturing, and control (CMC) properties. Importantly, tatCN19o was highly effective in vivo in global cerebral ischemia (GCI) models in both mouse and pig (the latter unpublished), even at extremely low doses of 0.01-0.02 mg/kg i.v.. The parent compound was also effective in vivo in a mouse model of acute ischemic stroke (transient middle cerebral artery occlusion; tMCAo). Neuroprotection was seen even at the latest time points tested so far after the various ischemic/excitotoxic insults (0.5h after global cerebral ischemia; 1h after stroke model; 6h in neuronal cultures). Here, SPAN will provide rigorous, unbiased testing of tatCN19o in rodent tMCAo models for direct comparison to other candidate interventions.

Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) continues to be a major problem,
chronically infecting ~300 million people worldwide and causing more than 500,000 deaths per year. High
numbers of unvaccinated individuals combined with vaccine breakthrough cases continues to allow the virus to
spread throughout the community and cause morbidity and mortality at high rates. Current HBV therapies limit
viral replication, but do not provide a cure for HBV infection. As such, there is an urgent need for innovative
therapeutics to treat HBV infection and provide a lasting cure for infected individuals.
Host-directed therapies (HDTs) offer a promising approach in this regard. Rather than targeting the virus itself,
HDTs target the host to either restrict an essential growth factor or upregulate innate defenses. By targeting the
host to attack the virus, traditional mechanisms of antiviral resistance are circumvented. We are developing a
broad-spectrum antiviral RNA molecule targeting retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I), a host pattern recognition
receptor (PRR) evolved to recognize viral RNA to trigger innate antiviral immune responses, an approach
validated in preclinical studies to protect mice from multiple RNA and DNA viruses. Our preliminary data show
the RIG-I agonist, RAR, not only prevents HBV replication, but even clears cells of HBV DNA, something
not achieved by any approved HBV treatments. In the proposed studies herein, we will perform critical
formulation optimization to create a final product to be tested for efficacy against HBV infection. We will optimize
parameters of two clinically relevant nanoparticle formulations, including our novel nanoparticle emulsion, which
effectively protects and delivers RNA in vivo. We will optimize formulation parameters and down-select a final
formulation by measuring cytokine release patterns in vivo from the liver, blood, and spleen following innate
immune agonist delivery. The lead formulated RAR complexes will be tested for efficacy against HBV infection
in vitro.
To this point, little progress has been made clinically in developing innate immune agonists as therapeutics. Our
expertise formulating agonists and vaccine platforms (including RNA) for preclinical and clinical trials will allow
us to use a variety of nanoparticle formulations to deliver this RNA RIG-I agonist safely and effectively to
chronically infected individuals. With results from this Phase I project, we will advance our formulated host-
directed RNA molecule into preclinical development and in vivo efficacy studies as part of our Phase II research.",  ,,,,BRYAN  BERUBE,,(815) 900-1777,bryan.berube@hdt.bio,,  ,

The aim of this proposal is to shorten the time to licensure and marketing of Sanaria’s PfSPZ vaccines by funding aspects of the development program not typically supported through Phase II or Phase IIB grants or contracts. Despite annual investments of >$3 B in malaria control, malaria killed more people in Africa in 2020 than did COVID-19 and the 627,000 malaria- attributable deaths were the highest since 2012. The RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine, recommended in 2021 by WHO for use in young children, has limited efficacy in preventing malaria hospitalizations (21%) and severe malaria (30%), and no reported protection against Pf infection. Thus, existing tools are inadequate, and a highly effective vaccine is still desperately needed. The critical need is for a highly efficacious vaccine that prevents malaria infection to support malaria elimination. Our 1st generation Sanaria® PfSPZ vaccine, based on radiation attenuated PfSPZ, is safe and well tolerated in 5-month- to 61-year-olds in 21 clinical trials in 9 countries, 6 in Africa. It induces excellent protection against heterologous controlled human malaria infection for at least 8 m and significant VE against intense natural Pf transmission in field trials in Africa for at least 18 m. Most recently it protected against clinical malaria in African women of child-bearing potential during two malaria transmission seasons over 18 m without boosting. Additional clinical trials in African children and pregnant women and Indonesian soldiers will start in Q2/3 2022 using PfSPZ Vaccine manufactured to meet Phase 3 compliance. Most excitingly, Sanaria has developed a late-arresting, replication competent (LARC) vaccine, PfSPZ-LARC2 that is expected to be 5-10 times more potent and less expensive than the 1st generation vaccine. Our progress toward commercialization has been facilitated by a Commercialization Readiness Pilot Program (CRPP). However, advice from consultants, communications with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US FDA, exciting results of field trials of the vaccine, and the technological development of PfSPZ-LARC2 have all significantly affected our program. As all of Sanaria’s PfSPZ vaccines utilize the same manufacturing, quality, and regulatory processes and clinical trial designs, the overall aims of our ongoing CRP program have not changed; rather our innovations and developments have identified new manufacturing, quality, regulatory and clinical tasks not funded in the ongoing CRPP, tasks that are required for achieving licensure and commercialization of the most potent and cost effective PfSPZ vaccine. This CRPP will facilitate production of the professional packages responsive to our consultants’ advice, recommendations from the EMA and FDA, and to our technical advances. Success will significantly shorten the time until product licensure and launch, and consequently to sales and saving many lives of those affected by malaria.",  ,,,,STEPHEN L HOFFMAN,,3017703222,slhoffman@sanaria.com,,  ,

Viruses are the causative agents of most respiratory tract infections. Knowledge of the transmission modes for pathogenic respiratory viruses is critical for improving mitigation strategies that safeguard public health, but understanding their transmission mechanisms is hampered by existing sampling methods. So far, no method has been recommended by the public health organizations for the collection and detection of airborne viruses. The lack of standard protocols results from the fact that no sampling procedure is appropriate for sampling of all bioaerosols. During sampling, it is necessary to minimize inactivation of microbes, such as incapacitating desiccation and destructive impaction upon collection onto a collection surface. When collecting samples for detection of viral genomic RNA or DNA, maintaining the viability of the virus is not necessary, but maintaining nucleic acid integrity is essential, especially for RNA, which is rapidly degraded upon exposure to the environment. For assessing infectivity, the pathogen needs to be viable. In both cases, gentle collection methods are required.  Although previous efforts have tried to separate virus-containing particles by aerodynamic size, maintaining their infectivity during sampling remains challenging. Here, we aim to develop a novel sampling system, the BioCascade, that will allow the collection of airborne viruses within four different bioaerosol particle size-fractions: >10 um, PM4-10, PM1.5-4 and PM1.5 into liquid medium, while maintaining infectivity of the viruses that are collected. In Phase I, we built a BioCascade prototype. Its particle size-range cut-off and the collection efficiency of each stage were modeled and designed by numerical simulations followed by validation through laboratory experiments using National Institutes of Science and Technology (NIST)-certified standard- sized particles. Its ability to collect and maintain the infectivity of bioaerosol was then assessed using microorganisms that were representative of the size ranges that would be encountered in bioaerosols. All Phase-I aims were successfully achieved. In Phase II, we aim to improve our prototype by expanding its capabilities, such as a cold collection chamber for providing a better environment for the collected pathogens, and a control system to maintain the liquid level that enables increased sampling time to several hours. By providing size-fractionated air samples that contain infectious pathogens, the Biocascade is envisioned as a powerful tool, not available before, that can transform our current disease-control paradigm from a reactive approach (to an outbreak after its fact) to a proactive approach (inform us the forthcoming viruses).",  ,,,,ARANTZAZU  EIGURENFERNANDEZ,,5106499360,arantza@aerosol.us,,  ,

Family caregivers are often required to provide post-discharge assistance to individuals with disabling conditions,
resulting in strain and negative effects on the caregiver’s health and well-being. While assessing and addressing
the needs of family caregivers has been identified as a priority area, there are no comprehensive programs
designed to assess a family member’s readiness to provide post-discharge care and address unmet needs.
PATH2Caregiving is a nurse-led comprehensive evidence-based transitional care program designed to bridge
this gap by evaluating unmet caregiver needs and implementing interventions specifically tailored to address
those needs. The program includes the Preparedness Assessment for the Transition Home (PATH)©, a
validated, 25-item, self-report screening tool that assesses and prioritizes biopsychosocial and ecological risk
factors for caregiving, and a corresponding Catalog of Caregiver Interventions© designed to minimize the
adverse effects of caregiving post-discharge through education, skill building, support, and links to community
resources. Implementing such a program may mitigate the adverse effects of caregiving by developing a
personalized discharge and transition plan and optimized preparation for the transition home following discharge
from an acute care hospital or inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF). The goal of this Phase I SBIR project is to
translate the PATH2Caregiving Program© into a usable, acceptable and accessible mHealth platform for iOS,
Android, and web-browsers. The project will involve the development and testing of a mobile application (app)
with minimal features (i.e., a minimum viable product [MVP]) focused on user experience (UX) and user interface
(UI).The app will be tested with caregivers and clinicians of patients being discharged from an IRF. In this Phase
I project we will address the following Specific Aims (SA): SA1: Identify design features for the UI and UX,
operationalization survey and algorithms, and develop the necessary backend architecture for the
PATH2Caregiving platform. It will involve developing the storyboards and further refinement based upon
quantitative and qualitative feedback through end-user focus groups on usability. SA 2: Develop and
computationally test the PATH2Caregiving software platform for accuracy, validity, and solution reproducibility.
SA 3: Conduct usability and acceptability testing of the MVP with a small group of end users, including family
caregivers and clinicians, to evaluate UX through quantitative surveys that include ratings of the features, format,
graphics, and ease of use; and qualitative interviews to assess accessibility, usability, usefulness, and likeability
of platform features. The successful development of the PATH2Caregiving MVP will be the basis for Phase II of
the project that will involve feasibility testing in real-world environments with partnerships in clinical sites, further
refinement of the platform as needed, and development of interoperability features for integration into EHR
systems.",  ,,,,STEPHANIE A VAUGHN,,(714) 273-9245,svaughn@fullerton.edu,,  ,

Adding to the current global instability brought on by the War in Ukraine, nickel metal prices between 2021 to March 2022 have risen 190%.  Even if the price lowers to pre-war values, this conflict showcases that reliance on foreign sources of energy-relevant minerals can result in high volatility and a risk to the US Department of Energy’s path to 100% electrification. For this reason, alternative mining and processing methods must be used to increase the yield of energy-relevant minerals and in tandem reduce carbon emissions. The proposed concept is related to Category 2: Develop technologies to capture energy-relevant minerals from CO2-reactive ore. We propose to utilize CO2 for ore carbonation to increase the yield of energy-relevant minerals, primarily nickel and magnesium in lateritic ore, but this could also extract copper, cobalt, manganese, and platinum group metals (PGMs) although that is beyond the scope of the project. Our base case TEA will cover the benefits for nickel and magnesium recovery that may be applied to the other metals mentioned above. The process is completed ex-situ by pressurizing typical energy-relevant gangue minerals in tailings with CO2, to make the corresponding metal carbonates in a matter of hours; thereby, allowing for increased leaching capability of energy-relevant minerals outlined above. The positive outcome is that this process simultaneously permits for the leaching of solutions that are normally not accessible, and is less corrosive than current extraction methods, all while storing carbon.",Hai  Duong,,,,Rita  Silbernagel,,(763) 226-9876,rita@phoenixtailings.com,,  ,

diagnosis challenging. In the proposed work, we will apply phage-display to produce avidity-
boosted and fast on-rate recombinant affinity reagents for use in capture and detection of HCV
core Ag in lateral flow assays (LFAs). This project is a collaboration between Tango Biosciences,
and the University of Houston laboratory of Prof. Richard Willson. Tango is a start-up specializ-
ing in innovative techniques in the phage-display and avidity engineering of combinatorial pep-
tides, antibody fragments, and antibody surrogates. Dr. Willson has extensive technical and
translational experience with LFAs.For Specific Aim #1, Tango will generate recombinant affinity
reagents by phage-display that bind the HCV core antigen (cAg) with high affinity and fast on-
rates. Tango will discover monobodies and human single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) that
bind different epitopes of cAg via Megaprimer Shuffled Tandem Affinity Reagents (MegaSTAR).
Tango will mutagenize the coding regions of individual monobodies/scFvs and select for fast on-
rates (critical in LFA) and slow off-rates. Tandem high-avidity forms of the best monobodies/
scFvs will be constructed with different length linkers for phage-display and conversion into LFA
reporter nanoparticles. We will aim for the following performance metrics for optimized affinity
reagents: on-rates of 108 M-1 sec-1 and dissociation constants of ≤ 1 pM. In Specific Aim #2, viri-
ons and soluble forms of the optimized affinity reagents will be formatted by Dr. Willson's team
as capture and detector reagents in phage LFAs. After systematically testing buffers, conjugate
and blocking chemistries, the goal will be to reach a limit of detection (LOD) of cAg (spiked into
human plasma) of 0.5 pM (10 pg/mL), which is sensitive enough to detect 85% of HCV infec-
tions. We will validate the optimized LFA format by spiking cAg over a range of concentrations
into commercial, de-identified human plasma from both sexes, a range of ages, and varied dis-
ease and metabolic backgrounds, to detect any cofounding biological variables. Finally, the best
affinity reagents and prototype LFA will be evaluated in the laboratory of an HCV expert. Suc-
cessful completion of this work will lead to a prototype LFA for HCV cAg and establish a re-
search paradigm applicable for the development of superior LFAs for detecting infections.

Percutaneous intervention (PCI) is the most frequently performed procedure to treat CAD. Microvascular obstruction (MVO) and “no reflow phenomenon” (NRF) are major barriers that preclude optimal outcomes and are independent risk factors for mortality and heart failure. Current devices are only partially effective in mitigating MVO and NRF following PCI for MI. The mechanisms responsible for MVO are complex and multifactorial. Adenosine, an endogenous nucleoside, attenuates many of the mechanisms responsible for MVO. Seminal studies in our laboratory demonstrated that intravenous adenosine resulted in striking myocardial protection, a finding confirmed in large clinical trials. Adenosine’s full therapeutic potential is compromised due to its ultrashort half-life (approximately 1 second) in human blood. By combining guidewire design, surface chemistry, jet milling of adenosine and creation of novel hydrophilic drug-loading and diffusion barrier coatings, we developed a guidewire platform (Adenowire) which allows for continuous delivery of adenosine throughout a PCI procedure. In vitro studies confirmed an ideal elution profile for adenosine that was verified in large animal models where robust vasodilatation and rapid reversal of vasoconstriction was identified. The novel inert coating also provides antiplatelet effects that are amplified with the addition of adenosine in the coating. Bench studies reveal that wire performance and coating quality are comparable to inert hydrophilic commercially available guidewires. While our phase 2 SBIR grant and subsequent development resulted in a safe and functional product, a significant funding gap remains before the device can be commercialized. Manufacturing and coating of Adenowires were not subjected to rigorous FDA regulatory requirements and utilized a non-sterilized product. Adenowire is classified as a combination product and both adenosine and guidewires are already FDA approved. A pre-IND submission by a regulatory consultant determined that approval would occur via CDRH (device) division utilizing a “de novo“ pathway. In order to proceed with clinical trials, the following assistance is needed: 1) Late Stage Research and Development on guidewire manufacturing and application of coating utilizing good manufacturing practice (GMP) and evaluation of biocompatibility and functional parameters on a sterilized product; 2) Regulatory Assistance to include strategy, documentation, submission of IDE application and determination of size of requirements for clinical trials. Results obtained from these studies would be invaluable since such data would result in finalization of the product allowing issuance of an IDE and initiation of a First in Man (FIM) clinical trial. This will greatly enhance our ability to obtain additional funding and strategic partnerships. Adenowire is a transformative device that is inexpensive, will have a large target market and represents a major technological advancement for treating CAD patients with PCI.",  ,,,,MERVYN B FORMAN,,4048430545,formanm@bellsouth.net,,  ,

Adding to the current global instability brought on by the War in Ukraine, nickel metal prices between 2021 to March 2022 have risen 190%.  Even if the price lowers to pre-war values, this conflict showcases that reliance on foreign sources of energy-relevant minerals can result in high volatility and a risk to the US Department of Energy’s path to 100% electrification. For this reason, alternative mining and processing methods must be used to increase the yield of energy-relevant minerals and in tandem reduce carbon emissions. The proposed concept is related to Category 2: Develop technologies to capture energy-relevant minerals from CO2-reactive ore. We propose to utilize CO2 for ore carbonation to increase the yield of energy-relevant minerals, primarily nickel and magnesium in lateritic ore, but this could also extract copper, cobalt, manganese, and platinum group metals (PGMs) although that is beyond the scope of the project. Our base case TEA will cover the benefits for nickel and magnesium recovery that may be applied to the other metals mentioned above. The process is completed ex-situ by pressurizing typical energy-relevant gangue minerals in tailings with CO2, to make the corresponding metal carbonates in a matter of hours; thereby, allowing for increased leaching capability of energy-relevant minerals outlined above. The positive outcome is that this process simultaneously permits for the leaching of solutions that are normally not accessible, and is less corrosive than current extraction methods, all while storing carbon.",Hai  Duong,,,,Rita  Silbernagel,,(763) 226-9876,rita@phoenixtailings.com,,  ,

Bunyaviruses are the largest order of RNA viruses that includes many clinically relevant human pathogens such as Lassa, Rift Valley Fever and various hantaviruses which cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF). SFTSV, or Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, is an emerging tick-borne bunyavirus that has caused outbreaks in Eastern Asia (China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam) with up to a 30% case fatality rate. The host tick vector has now been discovered over a large geographical setting and SFTSV has been found in numerous wild and domestic animal species highlighting a risk for zoonotic spillover into humans. Though humans are usually dead-end hosts, human to human transmission has been documented through blood and mucosal secretions. Furthermore, SFTSV has a segmented genome which increases ability to reassort genes and mutate. Due to these features, in its 2017 “Research and Development Blueprint” the WHO identified SFTSV as one of 11 pathogens likely to cause a sever outbreak in the future. As we have learned, from experience with recent zoonotic outbreaks, preparedness is of the utmost importance. We are proposing to continue development of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine for SFTSV. rVSV is an approved vaccination platform that is immunogenically potent and proven tolerable. Preliminary work from our group has demonstrated that rVSV-SFTSV can elicit protection in mice, is tolerable in immunocompromised animals and upon CNS injection, and can generate cross protecting responses to a related bunyavirus. Furthermore, we observe elevated SFTSV-specific T cell and antibody responses against both SFTSV spike proteins, Gn and Gc. In this Phase I, we propose to improve the design of our vector which will increase viral titers to facilitate vaccine manufacturing and increase immunogenicity in animals. In aim 1, we will focus on reverse engineering mutations into rVSV that will improve SFTSV Gn/Gc incorporation into particles thereby improving virus replication and yield in vitro. We will characterize these 2nd generation (Gen2) vaccines using molecular and cell-based assays scoring for viral replication, GnGc expression in infected cells and incorporation of GnGc in VSV virions. In aim 2, we will assess the ability of our Gen2 vaccine to protect animals in lethal SFTSV challenge studies. We hypothesize that increased GnGc expression and replication of the Gen2 vectors will lead to improved immune responses in vaccinated animals compared to the Gen1 vector. We will assess immune correlates of protection such enhanced neutralizing and cross protective antibodies as well as robust T cell responses compared to Gen1 rVSV-SFTSV vaccinated animals. If successful, our Phase I would set the foundation for a Phase II to advance manufacturing and stringently study protective capacity of our vaccine in more advanced animal models.",  ,,,,PAUL  BATES,,2158987293,pbates@pennmedicine.upenn.edu,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,  ,

The infrastructure might be in a friendly, neutral, or hostile region, yet has to be relied upon for secure communication. Non-authorized, misconfigured, or compromised systems increase the risk of malicious activities impacting the security of the US forces and their operations due to the lack of visibility into its configuration, operation, and management. Even in a Blue terrain environment, authorization is vital due to outsourcing of the 5G systems and components. The supply chain for devices commonly employed in 5G networks includes not only the (potentially) trusted system integrators and/or suppliers. Many entities in these highly complex and globally distributed supply chains are untrusted, possibly controlled by adversary foreign governments. Assembling a supply chain consisting of trusted entities is prohibitively costly. Hence, a mechanism that authenticates the components of 5G systems is a necessity. Due to the ubiquitous nature and abundance of 5G systems, this detection/authentication mechanism must be highly sensitive, cost-effective, and easily/quickly deployable. Aether Argus Inc. is pleased to propose “ArEMGuard - Mobile Infrastructure Authenticationin Expeditionary Regions via Unintended Electromagnetic Emission Monitoring”. ArEMGuard represents a novel and unique approach to protect both legacy and 5G mobile core network elements (MCNEs) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices against firmware supply chain attacks and detecting run-time (software) exploitation. The primary novel aspect of our proposed research is the combination of techniques that leverage unintended electromagnetic emissions (EMEs) to conduct runtime state attestation for MCNEs. These emissions are byproducts of legitimate operations on a given hardware platform with a characteristic pattern that can be sensed from close proximity.

Optical manufacturing has been a rapidly growing field with advancements in all technology spectrums. High performance optical systems are needed in aerospace, defense, medical, and commercial components. Industry is requiring these components to be manufactured to tighter tolerances and lower costs. Many advancements have been made in cost reduction and increasing quality in axis-symmetric optics such as flats, spheres, aspheres, and off axis parabolas. Some of the advancements on axis-symmetric parts have been applied to freeform and conformal manufacturing, but, due to the drastic geometric differences, they do not have the same impact in time reduction. Along with the geometric challenges, the materials used for MDA applications are made from hard-to-machine ceramics in order to withstand harsh environments and still provide high quality optical transmission. The harder ceramics require unique methods to remove the proper amount of sub surface damage to meet roughness tolerances. The purpose of this SBIR Phase II proposal is to improve the existing freeform polishing processing methods by 2x to 3x on crystals and hard ceramics. Extensive research has been done to get the current process in a stable condition to consistently produce optical freeform components. This research work was done in prototype phases that have addressed areas that need improvement to reach the optical tolerances, with a focus on quality over production times. New technologies have been created for metrology and machining that specifically address conformal ceramic window challenges. The goal is to move the optical freeform process from small quantity high cost protypes to larger yields and lower cost production. Leveraging the knowledge from research and existing freeform manufacturing processes, new advancements will be made to reach the proposed goal. Five keys areas have been identified to reach the set goal: intelligent machining, fixture improvements, improvements for OptiPro’s OptiSonic technology for ultrasonic grinding, development of deterministic edge polishing, and increased software capabilities in OptiPro’s freeform manufacturing software PROSurf. Improvements in each of these topics will drastically decrease the overall polishing time in conformal window manufacturing. These advancements will have a positive impact on many areas of optical manufacturing as the technology being developed will work on all optical system components to reduce grinding and polishing process times.

The goal of this proposal is to advance a new therapeutic approach targeting myosin for polycystic kidney
disease (PKD). PKD is a major life-threatening Mendelian disorder that affects 12,000,000 individuals,
representing a market opportunity of ~$1 billion. In PKD, tiny tubules in the kidneys, liver, and other organs
gradually expand into fluid-filled cysts, leading to organ failure. PKD is commonly inherited as a loss-of-function
mutation in PKD1 or PKD2, encoding polycystin-1 (PC1) or polycystin-2 (PC2), respectively. General treatment
involves managing complications of chronic kidney disease, controlling blood pressure, and preparing for renal
replacement therapy. Tolvaptan, a vasopressin receptor antagonist, is approved for use in rapidly progressing
cases, but its modest efficacy and occasionally severe side effects make it unsuitable for many PKD patients.
How cysts form mechanistically remains incompletely understood, which has hampered drug development. Thus
a compelling need and market exists for new treatments and targets to slow or reverse PKD.To better model human PKD and develop therapeutic strategies, we have invented PKD1-/- and PKD2-/- human
kidney organoids, which undergo PKD-specific cyst formation from tubules, reconstituting the disease phenotype
in a petri dish. Organoid studies reveal that PKD cyst formation is highly sensitive to the microenvironment, and
that blebbistatin, a myosin II inhibitor, greatly increases cystogenesis. Non-muscle myosin II (NMII), a known
target of blebbistatin that confers strength and shape to cells, is strongly expressed in tubular epithelia and
redistributed in organoid cysts. Conversely, in preliminary studies, we have discovered a myosin II activator that
reduces PKD cystogenesis, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy. This compound has a well-established
safety and bioavailability profile in large animal studies. Based on our preliminary data and the literature, we
hypothesize that it directly activates NMII heavy chains to strengthen and stiffen the cytoskeleton of kidney
tubules, thus limiting their tendency to deform into cysts. The major goal of this proposal is to demonstrate this
mechanism of action as proof of concept for targeted drug development. This will be achieved in independent
aims using purified NMII in vitro and in phenotypic human and animal models.Aim #1: Demonstrate that our hit compound activates NMII in assays suitable for drug optimization.Aim #2. Elucidate the targetable function of NMII during PKD cyst formation in organoids and in vivo.
Completion of these two aims will connect the dots between our therapeutic hit compound, NMII, and PKD cyst
formation from the single molecule to organoid scale, elucidating a novel mechanism of action for treating cystic
disease. This will demonstrate proof of concept, further validate the therapeutic hit, and lay the groundwork for
deeper drug development efforts in Phase II (lead optimization and pre-clinical testing).",  ,,,,HONGXIA  FU,,(857) 210-0606,hfu@uw.edu,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,  ,

Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) infection has an estimated global incidence of 33 million cases in
children younger than 5 years, with up to 234,000 dying of the disease. Although often characterized as a
pediatric disease, RSV infection in adults aged 65 years or older represent a substantial health burden. Recent
failures of late-phase trials for vaccines and therapies based on monoclonal antibodies (mAb) prompt the
development of novel interventions for RSV. To fill this urgent clinical need, Celestial Therapeutics is developing
an endogenous anionic pulmonary surfactant lipid, palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol, to be administered via
dry powder inhalation that acts as a dual-modal antiviral and anti-inflammatory agent. The mode of action of
palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol has been extensively studied, however, to develop it into a stable and
effective drug product, a dry powder formulation needs to be developed. Celestial therapeutics has already
gathered preliminary data regarding the generation of a dry powder with the desired particle size. In this SBIR
Fast-Track project, Celestial Therapeutics will complete the development of the dry powder inhalation (DPI)
formulation suitable for inhalation. The Phase I study will 1) demonstrate the efficacy of DPI in vivo as a treatment
and/or prophylactic agent against RSV when administered via inhalation; 2) confirm the safety profile of the DPI,
and 3) show that the DPI has the desired pharmacokinetic profile in vivo. The successful outcomes of Phase I
will open to a Phase II project where Celestial Therapeutics will optimize manufacturing and define quality
controls (Aim II-1), followed by pivotal preclinical safety pharmacology and toxicology studies (Aim II-2). The DPI
will improve the current clinical practice as it will be the first available dual-modal antiviral/anti-inflammatory
prophylactic and interventional treatment against RSV. Serving both as treatment and prophylaxis, the DPI will
be preferred over mAb injections. Upon completion of the Phase II project, a pre-IND meeting will be held with
the FDA to discuss the data gathered.",  ,,,,AJAY  GUPTA,,(949) 402-2388,sbir@celestialtherapeutics.com,,  ,

Existing Navy ground fault detection systems can detect and locate single line to ground faults on a given phase, but a second ground fault on a separate phase causes a line-to-line fault which trips breakers and removes power from downstream loads. Quickly detecting, locating, and resolving an initial single ground fault can mitigate the risk of double faults and loss of power to mission critical equipment. The ground fault detection and localization system design will function for both permanent and non-permanent fault cases, particularly for USN Shipboard 440VAC three phase radial power distribution either grounded or ungrounded. The low voltage alternating current interface standard, MIL-STD-1399-300-1, provides further characteristics. For ungrounded and high resistance grounded power systems, a single line to ground fault is permissible on one of the three phases enabling continued operation. Without the benefit of simplified fault localization of a solidly grounded power system which trips upon a single ground fault, it is critical to quickly identify the faulted piece of Navy equipment or at least identify the shipboard compartment containing the fault. The Hepburn and CAPS team proposes a noise pattern analysis approach to ground fault protection which utilizes machine learning techniques and yields the benefit of passive localization. This approach mitigates an interference issue that comes with conventional protection strategies involving disruptive signal injection as well as manual disconnect hunting of fault localization by trial and error. The methodology is based upon a patent presenting an autonomous fault location approach differentiating fault location by signal oscillatory characteristics (US Patent 8067942 B2, ōMethod for locating phase to ground faults in DC distribution systemsö). In the presence of power electronic switching devices (converter, etc.), this noise pattern analysis-based fault localization does not necessarily require signal injection, but passively monitors a naturally occurring ringing circuit which is altered by a given fault case location. In the absence of such sources of continually occurring switching transients, separate injection of a small amount of signal noise may be required. The team is building upon extensive previous work and intellectual property. The Phase I design approach has been validated for the LVAC radial system of this topic. Phase II will involve prototyping, validating, and demonstrating the approach with plans for shipboard application.",John N Amy,Senior Technologist,2158971301,John.amy@navy.mil,Ben  Ford,,7034015198,ben.ford@hepburnandsons.com,Florida State University,Jodie  Bell,8506459341

The long-term goal of this project is to develop a scalable, user-friendly, continuous diabetes monitoring
(CDM) system to minimize the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) for millions of diabetes patients,
especially those with type I diabetes by adding continuous ketone monitoring (CKM) to the IMS
continuous glucose monitor (CGM). IMS has developed the world's smallest wireless electrochemical
CGM using a novel semiconductor (CMOS) platform. This design offers some unique advantages due
to its smart sensor (compared to passive sensors in competitor designs) including extreme
miniaturization (system is smaller than half a sesame seed), on-chip integration of multiple sensors,
improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (thus improving hypoglycemia accuracy), decrease in sensor
capacitance and membrane thickness (thus improving response speed), and on-chip temperature
calibration. This system can enable automatic closed-loop glucose control without meal announcements
and carbohydrate counting and without the fear of missed hypoglycemic events; greatly simplifying
patient experience and improving safety.
We have demonstrated the function of our CGM platform in the lab, in animals, and recently in humans.
The addition of CKM can significantly improve the value of the system to detect impending DKA that
goes unnoticed with the current CGM systems, causing significant harm to the at-risk patients.
Therefore, our objective in the original proposal was to develop a multi-analyte sensing platform that
can sense both glucose and ketone in the interstitial fluid (ISF) using a single device. The sensing
platform would be tested in the lab.
This research is significant as it will enable the first CDM system with a small, pain-free needle-
insertion (26-gauge needle) that can work for a long time (rt30 days). Once proven, this system can be
extended to include other important analytes (e.g., insulin, glucagon) without increasing its size or
complexity, owing to on-chip integration of multiple sensors on a single microscale device.
During our work, we discovered an unforeseen issue with the ketones sensing chemistry that prevents
long-term stability. We have discovered a potential solution to that by using a conjugated enzyme.
We need additional support via this supplement to enable us to test this solution.

Safety and Tolerability of TASIS-Peanut (Targeted Allergen Specific Immunotherapy within theSkin) patch for the Treatment of Peanut Allergy
Food allergies affect 30 million people in the USA and 17 million in Europe. Six million children, roughly 1 in 13, in the USA
have at least one food allergy; this equates to at least 1 in every classroom. Currently, there is only one FDA approved
therapy in the USA for food allergies. Food allergies are expected to grow 10% annually until at least 2022. It is also
common for someone to have more than one allergy. This is a growing, underserved global market that has few treatment
options. A meaningful initial therapy would be one that reduces the chance for anaphylactic reaction after accidental
exposure. Such a therapy will help bring peace of mind to families, allow for children affected by food allergies to have
better quality of life, feel less socially out casted and most importantly reduce the potential for death from accidental
procedure.
Moonlight Therapeutics is developing a targeted way to administer allergens into the top skin layers to desensitize an
allergic patient, called Targeted Allergen Specific Immunotherapy in the Skin (TASIS). Delivery is achieved using
microneedles applied to the skin for a few minutes, which are minimally invasive and painless. Importantly microneedles
can deliver into topmost skin layers with high precision and reproducibility. Because TASIS delivers small doses in the top
and superficial skin layers, the approach is expected to produce little to no systemic adverse reactions. The company's
first treatment is focused on peanut allergy and is called TASIS-Peanut. We have demonstrated efficacy of our approach in
a pre-clinical mouse model of peanut sensitization.
This Fast-track (Phase1/Phase2) SBIR grant (U44) application is for a Phase 1 safety and tolerability study to be
conducted in partnership between the company and collaborating clinical research sites. The objective of the U44 Fast-
track grant is to prepare documents for (grant PHASE 1) and conduct (grant PHASE 2) a Phase 1 clinical trial to
assess the safety and tolerability of TASIS-Peanut in peanut allergic children and adults. The Phase 2 portion of the grant
also includes aims geared towards production of TASIS-Peanut for the clinical trial. The company currently has a R42
Fast-track grant for the pre-clinical development of TASIS-Peanut.
Overall this grant will enable evaluation of the safety and tolerability of TASIS-Peanut in a first-in-human clinical trial. It will
set the stage for evaluation of efficacy in a Phase 2 clinical trial.",  ,,,,SAMIRKUMAR  PATEL,,(404) 348-8294,samir.patel@moonlighttx.com,,  ,

While temporary and  3 treatable, 50-65% of mothers with PMD symptoms never receive a diagnosis or treatment due to inadequate  4 screening practices. PMDs remain undetected because mothers do not trust clinicians due to fear of judgment,  5 stigma, or even loss of parental rights. Untreated PMDs increase risk for maternal mortality, maternal suicide,  6 preterm birth, low birth weight, and adverse childhood experiences. There is an urgent unmet need for  7 comprehensive, real-time perinatal mental health monitoring to connect women to effective treatment. To meet  8 this need, BetterHope LLC (dba Poisera) is developing a technology platform to systemically monitor, screen,  9 refer, and treat PMDs for women from early pregnancy through 36 months postpartum. The platform includes a 10 mobile health (mHealth) app, where a chatbot conversationally engages mothers in daily reflection exercises 11 about pregnancy, motherhood, and mental health. Each week, the chatbot prompts mothers to complete a 12 state-of-the-art, validated adaptive diagnostic screening for PMDs. When a woman screens positive for PMD 13 symptoms, the Poisera platform connects the woman to a Psychiatric Perinatal Access Program (PPAP), 14 where a behavioral health clinician (BHC) will assess risk, deliver a brief therapeutic intervention, and 15 coordinate long-term treatment. BHCs update her risk profile and treatment information in Poisera’s 16 dashboard, where the patient’s clinician can track treatment progress. PPAPs exist in 30 states. PPAPs are 17 proven to improve PMD symptoms and guarantee continuity of care. Using a chatbot to longitudinally monitor 18 and screen for PMDs is an innovative approach because chatbots promote honest disclosure and increase 19 adherence. Further, the Poisera platform transforms the current, inadequate clinical practice for PMD 20 screening and treatment to one where clinicians are confident their patients receive effective treatment at PMD 21 onset because the information is seamlessly integrated into their clinical workflow. The long-term goal of this 22 research is to eliminate adverse health consequences from PMDs. In this Phase I SBIR, we will demonstrate 23 the Poisera platform meets the needs of both pregnant women and clinicians. In Aim I, we will demonstrate 24 that pregnant women find the Poisera app and chatbot usable. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate obstetric 25 clinicians find the Poisera dashboard usable in their clinical workflows. In Aim 3, we will conduct a two-arm 26 feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) to measure screening adherence and determine dropout behavior. 27 These outcomes will inform the design of our Phase II RCT, where we aim to demonstrate the Poisera platform 28 cost-effectively improves PMD outcomes for women from pregnancy to 36 months postpartum. Demonstrating 29 effective outcomes on these measures will provide us with the validation needed to sell the Poisera platform to 30 health systems and health insurers, a $2.8 billion annual market size. 31",  ,,,,MARIANNA  KERPPOLA,,7739889724,marianna@poisera.com,,  ,

A Near-Patient, Low Blood Volume Platform for Rapid Comprehensive Evaluation ofCoagulation in Trauma Patients(Fast-Track SBIR)
Trauma is a leading cause of death worldwide, with hemorrhage constituting the most common cause of
preventable death after injury. A third of trauma patients develop coagulopathy, characterized by abnormal
coagulation and inflammation, and require urgent transfusion to decrease the likelihood of organ failure and
mortality. Patients with post-traumatic coagulopathy experience many changes facilitated by the endothelium,
platelets, circulating coagulation factors, and immune system function, which make it difficult to assess using a
single biomarker. Conventional coagulation tests are informative, but most are not adequate for acute
hemorrhage control due to long result turnaround times (rt 45 minutes). Viscoelastic coagulation tests,
alternatively, can rapidly detect the presence of abnormal clotting, but necessitate longer test times (30-45
minutes) to provide results that may be used to determine specific changes in treatment. Repeated monitoring
of hemostasis is recommended for bleeding trauma patients, however, the cumulative blood loss required for
central laboratory coagulation tests (1-2 mL per test) increases the risk of iatrogenic anemia. The optimal
coagulation panel for rapid, recurrent assessment of coagulation in trauma patients does not yet exist.
To address the critical unmet need for rapid, low volume tests for the diagnosis and therapeutic management of
coagulopathy in trauma patients, we will develop a four-assay panel and corresponding near-patient digital
microfluidic (DMF) platform that will provide clinically actionable data to guide the administration of whole blood
transfusion and other blood products. Our innovative technology will simultaneously measure prothrombin
time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, and
platelet count from lt 50 µL of whole blood. All assay operations, including plasma separation from whole blood,
will be performed autonomously, facilitating use by minimally trained users in near-patient settings such as the
emergency department and operating room. By combining four essential assays in a single protocol with a time-
to-result of under 10 minutes, our system will better inform transfusion requirements, reduce iatrogenic blood
loss from recurrent coagulation monitoring, and improve clinical workflow in busy trauma settings.
Phase I of this Fast-Track SBIR project will establish feasibility of the testing panel by developing a DMF
instrument capable of simultaneously measuring PT/INR, aPTT, and fibrinogen on a single disposable cartridge.
We will also validate DMF-compatible hardware for the optical system required for platelet count measurement.
Phase II will integrate the optical system and complementary cartridge into our existing DMF platform to support
full automation of the platelet count assay. We will then multiplex the assays in a single run and evaluate the
analytical and clinical performance of each test. Our final product will be marketed for use in general and military
trauma settings during triage and perioperative periods, with secondary markets including adult and pediatric
patients undergoing surgery or other procedures that raise the risk for hemorrhage and shock.",  ,,,,VAMSEE K PAMULA,,(919) 724-8464,vpamula@baebies.com,,  ,

The fields of gene therapy and bacteriophage therapy are rapidly expanding and show promising
potential for treating genetic disorders and antibiotic resistant bacterial infections, respectively.
To meet these needs, improved high throughput and high affinity viral purification methods will be
required. Current high throughput viral purification methods mainly consist of resin-based
chromatography coupled with multiple filtration steps. Chromatography-based methods often lack
specificity for the particular virus target. For example, the commonly used ion exchange resins
are not able to separate contaminants sharing similar surface net charges to the virus particles.
Selection of mixed virus varieties such as viruses of different serotypes cannot be achieved with
chromatography methods. Affinity-based resin chromatography products targeting viral vectors
exist but are expensive or not suitable for large-scale purification. Additionally, they involve
coupling a binding entity to resin, which presents several disadvantages, including leaching of the
affinity ligand from the chromatography support or the ligand co-eluting with the virus particles.
Thus, improved methods for simple, rapid, and scalable purification of viral vectors are needed to
serve both the small-scale research community and large-scale industrial production. Bondwell
Technologies proposes to develop a novel purification system for large biomolecules, such as
viral vectors. The unique qualities of our functionalized biomaterial provide tremendous versatility
and addresses the current limitations of small- and large-scale viral purification. During this
proposed Phase I effort, we will first functionalize our biomaterials with an entity capable of
specifically recognizing a viral target. We will then test the biomaterial for their ability to bind the
viral target. Finally, we will prepare our biomaterial to be used as a membrane and test its ability
to bind a viral target with different complexities of starting material (e.g., with cellular debris
present).",  ,,,,CHRISTI  PARHAM,,(979) 475-4545,cparham@bondwelltech.com,,  ,

Traditional therapies target the virus and are thereby limited in effectiveness to the specific virus targeted. Evrys Bio is developing orally administered, broad-spectrum antivirals that target the host-cell sirtuin-2 protein (SIRT2). In vitro feasibility was demonstrated in SBIR Phase I for an early lead, FLS-359, showing broad effectiveness against four families of viruses posing problems for immunosuppressed transplant patients: herpesviruses, polyomaviruses, hepatitis viruses, and respiratory viruses. Additionally, SIRT2-targeting with FLS-359 blocked acquisition of viral drug resistance in an influenza model and was additive in antiviral activity with traditional direct-acting antivirals. A prototype was developed in SBIR Phase II, allowing selection of a Drug Candidate (DC) for Investigational New Drug (IND)-enablement that satisfied the in vitro Target Compound Profile with respect to antiviral potency and ADME, and in vivo oral bioavailability, target engagement, and tolerability. The DC is designated EV-100. In this SBIR Phase IIB application, we request funding to advance EV-100 toward an IND filing. The clinical trial will be designed to test the utility of EV-100 for prophylaxis of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection and disease in adult HCMV-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. To advance to the IND filing, we will establish relationships between EV-100 dose, pharmacokinetic parameters, efficacy, and toxicity. We will conduct non-GLP dose range finding safety studies in rats and dogs, and efficacy studies in murine HCMV viral challenge models to provide guidance and minimize risk with dosing regimen selection for costly GLP and clinical studies. In addition, we will perform studies to address published FDA in vitro virology study recommendations that will support an IND filing. These studies will include the assessment of EV-100 antiviral activity versus multiple laboratory and clinical HCMV isolates, including the analysis of EV-100 inhibitory activity toward HCMV variants that are resistant to currently approved drugs; testing for the evolution of viral drug resistance during serial passage of HCMV in increasing concentrations of EV-100 in cell culture; evaluation of EV-100 efficiency in combination with currently approved anti-HCMV drugs; delineation of EV- 100 as a function of HCMV dose; and additional parameters that help to predict the efficacy of EV-100 in transplant recipients. Finally, although HCMV prophylaxis is the intended initial indication, the broad-spectrum antiviral profile against human viruses is a potential breakthrough feature of EV-100. The drug has already been shown to inhibit both RNA and DNA viruses in addition to HCMV that can threaten both the organ and the survival of the patient following a transplant. In vitro studies in human cells and in vivo studies in humanized in mice will be performed to further evaluate this potentially unique broad-spectrum utility of EV-100.",  ,,,,STACY  REMISZEWSKI,,2016394340,stacy@evrysbio.com,,  ,

This will be the first antiviral therapy to treat HAV infection, which, despite vaccines to prevent disease, causes thousands of hospitalizations and many deaths each year in the U.S. DHQs, exemplified by the Roche compound, RG7834, have been shown to be effective antivirals for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and have been under development for HBV by a number of small and major pharmaceutical companies. We are pioneering development of DHQs for treatment and prevention of hepatitis A. We have shown DHQs are highly active against HAV in cell culture and in mice. DHQs inhibit the nucleotidyltransferases TENT4A/B, also called PAPD7/5, which play a role in cellular mRNA “quality control” and noncoding transcript metabolism and are necessary for efficient HBV and HAV RNA functions. However, their mechanism of action against HBV and HAV are distinct: while DHQs promote degradation of HBV mRNAs, they do not affect HAV RNA stability. Instead DHQs suppress HAV RNA synthesis. The selective sensitivity of viral over host transcripts to DHQs offered a new strategy of antiviral therapy with low risk for resistance. However, DHQ development has been slowed and even suspended because of neurotoxicity concerns in long- term animal studies. We therefore produced a family of hepatoselective HS-DHQs that use receptors enriched on hepatocytes to achieve a liver-selective distribution. Our lead HS-DHQs 2 and 3 have been shown to have nano-molar activities against HAV in cell culture and they target hepatocytes in culture and are enriched in the liver in mice. We have now synthesized a family of HS-DHQs to optimize their PK profiles. Our mouse studies suggest effective therapy for hepatitis A will require only brief antiviral therapy, and we propose that our HS-DHQs with less plasma and other tissue exposure will carry a low risk of neurotoxicity when used in this context. In this STTR Phase I application, we will perform lead optimization to advance HS-DHQs based not only on anti-HAV efficacy in tissue culture and PK study results, but also a neurotoxicity screen using an in vitro assay with primary rat neurons and in vivo distribution to neuronal tissues. The best HS- DHQs will be further studied for their efficacy in treating and preventing HAV infection in mice. HS-DHQs with the best antiviral, PK, and PD performance in murine models of HAV will then be advanced through preclinical studies in Phase II necessary to support a human clinical study.",  ,,,,YANMING  DU,,2678936579,yanming.du@bblumberg.org,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,  ,

Remission of maternal depression relates to improvements in both parenting behavior and child functioning, suggesting that treatment of maternal depression has the potential to improve outcomes across generations. To increase access to evidence-based depression treatment in this population, we developed Mom-Net, a coach-guided, e-health intervention for depressed mothers of young children. Mom-Net is coach-guided, given evidence that guided interventions produce significantly higher levels of engagement and effectiveness than unguided interventions. Mom-Net has demonstrated effectiveness in two controlled trials with low-income depressed mothers, with effectiveness derived from in-person coach training by a professional Mom-Net trainer. To increase Mom-Net dissemination, our Phase I SBIR efforts focused on developing and evaluating remote coach-training prototypes for paraprofessionals, replicating the in-person training program. Remote coach training includes self-guided online sessions, webinar live practice sessions with a professional trainer, and a certification process. At the end of Phase I, we received funding for a Mom-Net hybrid, type II implementation-effectiveness study (R01MH120237), resulting in quick expansion of the Phase 1 prototypes into a completed remote training process as a necessary component of the trial. The current Phase II project builds upon the R01 effort and a positive evaluation and successful realization of Phase I project goals. Phase II aims to: 1) create a remote Train- the-Trainer program and Administrative Portal, allowing community settings to internally train and monitor their own staff; 2) evaluate the Train-the-Trainer program on the primary outcomes of session completion, Mom-Net content and coaching skills knowledge, teaching strategy knowledge, and fidelity in observed trainer use of teaching strategies; 3) examine effectiveness equivalence between the two Mom-Net coach training options in a randomized trial in 33 Head Start agencies. Four staff within each agency (n = 132) will serve as paraprofessional coach trainees, randomized to be trained by either the external professional coach trainer or the trainer within the agency. Equivalency will be evaluated on session completion, Mom-Net content mastery, and fidelity in coaching skills. The proposed project, culminating in training at scale by offering two training options, will enable commercialization and broader dissemination of Mom-Net which, in turn, will contribute to greater access to a vulnerable, underserved population of mothers experiencing depressive symptoms.",  ,,,,DAVID R SMITH,,5414842123,david.smith@or-bis.com,,  ,

The goal of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a system for the point-of-care (POC) detection of
Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) in human vaginal swab samples that integrates our patented detector of pathogens
based on identification of species-specific, nucleic acid (NA) sequences. The detector relies on a novel
electromechanical signal transduction mechanism that enables the low-cost, optics-free and amplification-free
(e.g., no PCR) detection of DNA/RNA at ultralow concentration (~10-19 M). A compelling need persists for rapid
(minutes), cost effective, POC NA detection devices for infectious disease diagnostics so as to facilitate prompt,
well-informed therapies and counseling and to avoid potentially harmful actions including the inappropriate
prescription of antibiotics. In earlier work, we demonstrated the detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) with
sensitivity of ~98% and specificity of ~100%. Trichomoniasis, the most common curable, sexually transmitted
disease in the US, is often tested for in parallel with NG and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections and is
therefore a logical target for us to address. A key feature of the patented detector is the use of peptide nucleic
acid (PNA) capture probes, which are uncharged polyamide analogs to NAs that share the same base chemistry.
Since bead-PNA conjugates are designed to be charge neutral, they do not exhibit electrophoretic movement in
the presence of a DC electric field. However, the substantial negative charge acquired upon capture of a target
NA sequence makes the hybridized conjugate mobile. Electrophoresis of the bead-PNA conjugate with
hybridized target NA to the mouth of a smaller diameter glass pore causes a significant increase in pore
resistance, thereby resulting in a strong, sustained drop in measured ionic current. Nonspecifically bound NA is
removed from the bead conjugate in the strong electric field at the pore mouth resulting in no sustained signal.
Further, the opposing electroosmotic flow through the glass pore sweeps PNA-bead conjugates without
hybridized target away from the pore mouth. In such a way, this simple conductometric device gives a highly
selective (no observed false positives), binary response signaling the presence or absence of the target NA (and
associated pathogen). This project focuses on two Aims: 1) Demonstration of the detection of TV in remnant
vaginal swab samples from the UCLA Clinical Microbiology Laboratory with competitively high sensitivity (≥95%)
and specificity (≥95%) and 2) Development and feasibility testing of key steps in an integrated and robust
laboratory prototype device for rapid (lt5 mins) pathogen detection based on the relatively inexpensive lateral
flow assay (LFA) format. Successful achievement of these Aims will result in a device concept ready for
manufacturable prototype development that is capable of NG and TV testing with competitive accuracy and likely
with significant advantages of cost, rapidity, power and robustness. Further research and development work is
envisioned to expand sampling capabilities to other pathogens, including CT, and to other complex sample media
including blood and sputum.",  ,,,,SAM  BAE,,(657) 226-5977,sam.bae@enucleics.com,,  ,

round corn breeding and propagation practices. The constant presence of corn in Hawaii supportsmore than a dozen flights of corn earworm (CEW) per year making Helicoverpa zea a moresignificant problem (The Problem) relative to cooler climates. The result of months ofcommunications with Hawaii's seed industry the proposed STTR Phase I collaboration betweenLepidext and University of Hawaii Manoa is to develop a viable bio-based corn earworm controlmethod that will suppress CEW population and complement current and potentially futureIntegrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies of the industry.Lepidext is developing novel naturally occurring biopesticides to decrease insect populations.HzTM
Lepidext's first biopesticide (The Solution) Insterusis a sexually transmitted virus thatsterilizes adult moths suppressing CEW infestations and reducing subsequent generations.HzTM
Insterus is a patented strain of the sterilizing entomopathogen HzNV2 (Helicoverpa zeanudivirus 2) with markedly increased sterilizing efficiency relative to the wild-type virus.Hz
The purpose of this Phase I STTR project is to prove feasibility of Insterus as a powerful toolto reduce H zea infestations to below kernel damage thresholds in seed corn production systems.Two objectives are proposed for Phase I: to develop low input methods for continuous andHz
synchronous production and delivery of Insterus moths for use in Hawaii (Objective 1); and toHz
evaluate the use of Insterus to reduce H. zea infestations in Foundation and Breeding seed cornfield plots and refine application models for its delivery (Objective 2). A successful Phase 2 projectwould develop the approaches and help to define the complementary technologies required tosuppress CEW population levels lowering the need for chemical controls in Phase 3.Lepidext Inc was founded in 2015 after we developed a highly effective CEW sterilizing virusHzâ„¢
strain which was patented and trademarked as Insterus (Insect sterilizing virus). CEW is nativeto the Americas but has become a major global pest including its unintentional introduction toHzâ„¢
Hawaii. Insterus is designed to prevent pest damage by sterilizing moths to prevent caterpillarsHzâ„¢
rather than targeting caterpillars in the field. The optimal use case for Insterus may beinHzâ„¢
conjunction with existing methods for pest control. Insterus has a potential total addressablemarket of $12B estimated by the annual acreage planted with corn cotton and soybeans in theAmericas that are currently threatened by the pest.",  ,,,,Megha  Kalsi,,(859) 787-3719,megha@lepidext.com,University of Hawaii - Manoa,  ,

These novel devices use electroadhesive clutches to rapidly transition from a protective mode capable of supporting large inertial loads to a free motion mode which provides full range of motion and freedom of movement to pilots.  The prototypes demonstrated a holding force exceeding 134 N, the force needed to attenuate neck loading by 25% or more during a 12-G vertical maneuver.  Prototype clutches have undergone more than 500 cycles of use without failure of the electroadhesive materials and have been integrated into a helmet and harness. Lastly, we shaped our Phase II proposal based on the results of 26 customer discovery interviews which revealed the needs of pilots and stakeholders from five branches of the Human Systems Directorate (HSD). Our Phase II effort will transition our TRL3 prototypes to TRL6 and establish a Phase III transition plan. Our four objectives are: evaluation of airworthiness, transitioning to a standalone LEET system, optimization of the LEET control approach, and the development of a Phase III transition strategy. These objectives will be achieved by revising the Phase I prototypes to make them more robust to environmental risk factors. Developing a mobile power and control unit will transition our benchtop prototypes to standalone units. Next, we will subject these prototypes to standard tests of common risk factors including EMI/EMC, temperature, humidity, salt spray, vibration, rapid decompression, and explosive atmosphere. This will demonstrate that the LEET system can withstand the harsh conditions often encountered by Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE). We will optimize the LEET control strategy and mounting positions of the exotendons via biomechanical simulations in OpenSim. This work will culminate in the completion of four LEET prototypes for manikin testing at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. This testing will demonstrate the ability of the LEET system to provide protection against neck injury.  Lastly, we will construct our Phase III transition plan by developing a relationship with an industry partner. It is our goal to not only demonstrate the capability of our system, but also have a framework in place to transition the resulting TRL6 prototypes to standard Aircrew Flight Equipment.",Chris  Perry,,(937) 255-5411,chris.perry@us.af.mil,Kirby  Witte,,(575) 808-9909,kirby@estat.tech,,  ,

We will apply imaging methodologies at the core of medical MRI to efficiently map shallow groundwater and hydrogeologic properties at improved resolution. Conventional surface NMR has been proven as a powerful non-invasive technique for coarse groundwater imaging. The method is limited, however, by simplistic imaging protocols. To enhance sensitivity and spatial resolution, we will introduce “switched-field” NMR.This new paradigm combines gradient and prepolarization fields to allow localization of signals based on their frequency and phase response and will increase the signal-to-noise ratio for shallow water. In addition to improving resolution, these approaches will also accelerate measurement speed allowing the technology to be applied in a wider range of environments and markets. The Phase II2B tasks will engineer and commercialize a new ultra-lightweight, low-cost surface NMR instrument with greatly expanded measurement capabilities, for groundwater investigations up to 30m. This new product will incorporate the switched field detection and imaging methods developed and demonstrated in Phase II. Completion of this technology will deliver a powerful groundwater imaging product for commercial sale, rental, and/or services in the environmental, geotechnical, and subsurface research markets. This technology will be of value to companies, governments, and public agencies facing problems such as groundwater contamination, dewatering for geotechnical engineering, and permafrost mapping. The ability to image at high-resolution in with reduced survey times will improve the reliability of subsurface models, reduce site characterization costs, support informed decision making. In turn, this technology will improve project efficiency, reduce risk, and result in improved outcomes.",  ,,,,David  Walsh,,(425) 493-8122,davewalsh@vista-clara.com,,  ,

Current analog intervalometer designs require use of mechanical timing and indexing switches to determine state and only allow limited operational scenarios that do not easily account for anomalous operation (i.e., hang-fire). A digital solution could eliminate the entire use of the mechanical intervalometer by monitoring the state of the launcher via feedback from the firing signal event or other sensors. In addition, the use of a modern microcontroller to control the firing device would allow compensation for a wide range of system variables (e.g., storage and operational temperature effects on circuit resistance) which could then be accounted for in the stored fire control algorithms thus allowing for more precise and robust firing events when compared with the heritage intervalometer while providing the ability to fire individual rockets in a preferred order rather than sequentially.Ā Exo-Atmospheric Technologies will implement an Integrated Digital Ignition Device (IDID) powered by a microcontroller to replace current legacy analog intervalometer designs.Ā The avionics will be designed, built, and tested to verify performance specifications and requirements are met via bench-top demonstrations and environmental system-level testing.

Improvements are needed in high-performance scintillator materials for detecting and counting charged particles in real-time over a wide range of energies and beam intensities. Integrated Sensors, LLC has demonstrated two new types of high-performance scintillator materials as key components in a novel beam monitoring system designed to provide major advantages over current technology. The patented beam monitoring system has been designed to take advantage of both materials and can provide continuous real-time high-speed readout of beam position, shape, intensity, with high spatial resolution and single-particle sensitivity/position capability. The Phase-II program succeeded in demonstrating exceptional particle sensitivity/performance in terms of operation and imaging over an extremely wide intensity range from single-particles imaging to approximately 1011 particles per second. This level of performance and beam imaging inside a particle beamline greatly exceeded the programs initial goals/objectives and was demonstrated in real-time with ultra-high spatial resolution at the DOE Facility for Rare Isotope Beams located at Michigan State University. The new materials also demonstrated exceptional radiation damage resistance and can be made ultrathin and essentially transparent to the fast particle beams. The Integrated Sensors beam monitoring system offers a breath of capability not available in any other beam monitor system and could achieve an unprecedent payback time of just several months per unit due to the very significant savings in beam tuning time. The Phase-IIB program is planned for just one-year and will transition from R&amp;D to development of a flexible modular product platform that can be easily customized for different applications in a wide variety of particle beam environments. The system will also be very cost competitive and will also be able to self-calibrate with minimal maintenance required. The commercial applications for the proposed technology are scientific, industrial and medical. The scientific applications are primarily directed at nuclear physics, but can also be important for high energy physics, etc. For industrial applications there are more than ten thousand small accelerators and many could benefit by the proposed technology. However, the greatest benefit could be in the medical field for the treatment of cancer by external beam radiation therapy, including the newest treatment being explored of FLASH radiotherapy.

A route to low carbon ethylene will have a meaningful impact as ethylene production is the largest world-wide and US chemical process in terms of production volumes, energy consumed, and carbon emitted. This project fits well within an overall strategy for decarbonization of the US manufacturing industry. In this Phase IIB project we will develop a low energy, low carbon impact reaction strategy for producing ethylene. The process will maintain or improve on yields of ethylene from ethane while matching or reducing current ethylene costs. This scalable process can be deployed at this site of low volume producers or shut-in natural gas or shale gas wells or at large chemical production sites. Research tasks will focus on developing new chemical reactors and processing strategies to meet these goals while promising up to 88% carbon reductions as compared to ethane steam cracking. Prior work demonstrated reaction and process technologies for low carbon reduced energy conversion of ethane to ethylene while identifying additional improvements to processing and production strategies for cost reduction. We address these improvements in the Phase IIB research, including optimization of reactor design, processing parameters and adjustments to reaction chemistry to reduce costs. Taken together, these changes represent a fundamentally different method of producing ethylene while preserving product quality and throughput. Combined with modeling and economic analysis to further enhance the overall conversion process, the proposed work will enable a new economically competitive approach to ethylene and downstream processes, including gas to liquids. Success offers a natural gas or shale gas alternative to using crude oil for petrochemical and related products.

This will improve the corrosion resistance, reliability, and lifetime of components in liquid-fuel and liquid-cooled reactors. Molten salts enable economical operation due to higher temperatures (&gt;600&#176;C), thermal energy storage, and ability to dissolve fuel in the coolant. Coolants require corrosion resistant materials that meet or supersede existing standard codes for these systems. Reactors require validation and testing of material systems that produce robust component structures enabling them to withstand corrosive environments. Develop and demonstrate a scalable, low-cost bimetallic overlay electrodeposition process to improve the lifetime and durability of molten salt reactor components. State-of-the-art overlays and diffusion-bond processes, based on scalable manufacturing-ready approaches, will improve corrosion resistance to high temperature operation, and help to drive near- and long-term commercialization of molten salt systems. Functionally graded diffusion-bonded bimetallic overlays eliminated corrosive attack of 316H stainless steel substrates after exposure to molten fluoride-lithium-sodium- potassium salts at 750&#176;C for 1000 hours. Overlays were applied to the internal diameter of small pipes, as exemplars for fluid transfer, heat exchangers, and reactors. The combined cost of a 316H stainless steel pipe and an overlay was 67% less expensive than building the same component out of nickel-based superalloys. These technical and economic benefits led to support and interest from the molten salt cooled, nuclear, concentrated solar power, supercritical carbon dioxide cycles, and methane pyrolysis communities. Overlays will be applied and diffusion bonded onto target substrates and components (valves, plumbing, and heat exchangers) of interest to the team. The overlay properties (corrosion resistance/adhesion) will be validated in simulated environments. Data obtained from processing and testing will be used to develop standards for the materials and manufacturing process recommendations (i.e., technical specification sheets and preferred operating procedures) for commercial overlay application. Development and demonstration of these technical/commercial elements will lead to commercial acceptance of the overlay technology and alignment with future government and commercial missions. This technology produces a low-cost, high-value corrosion resistant overlay that can be applied to a wide range of substrates and components for manufacturing and repair applications within the molten salt cooled community. This includes nuclear reactors, concentrated solar cell, supercritical carbon dioxide cycles, and methane pyrolysis systems.",  ,,,,Timothy  Hall,,(937) 836-7749,timhall@faradaytechnology.com,,  ,

We seek code designs and decoding algorithms that can approach fundamental, information-theoretic limits for block sizes as short as 50 bits. Very short block length FEC is important in global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC). Tight bounds on FEC performance in the finite block length regime have been known since 2010. Whereas Shannon’s channel coding theorem hinted at capacity-achieving code construction techniques for very long block lengths, Polyanskiy, et al.’s results for very short block lengths provide no such guidance to the FEC practitioner. As of today, the information theory community understands the fundamental limits on coding in the very short to short block length regime, but we do not yet understand how to best approach those limits. This SBIR aims to close that gap between theory and practice. Our approach leverages two high-performance, low-complexity universal decoding algorithms. One was developed by the proposed Principal Investigator as part of his doctoral work at USC, the other was proposed recently by researchers at MIT. Whereas prior work focused on the application of these algorithms to existing codes (e.g., BCH and polar codes), we will design new codes in Phase I that are optimized for these algorithms, thereby unlocking powerful new families of scalable short and very short codes. In Phase II, we will develop flexible decoding architectures for implementation and demonstration in software-defined radio and user equipment.

Recent research and development in the CBD S&T community has emphasized Integrated Early Warning (IEW) architectures that rely upon a layered sensing strategy that includes CBD-specific sensors such as lidar, but also incorporates a Force Protection (FP) sensing layer that provides complementary Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) data that can be fused with the CBD data. Elastic backscatter lidar has proven to be a powerful tool for IEW by enabling high-sensitivity long-range detection, tracking and characterization of airborne aerosol plumes and CB aerosol agent release events. The Real-time Eyesafe Visualization, Evaluation and Analysis Lidar Next Generation (REVEALng) technology, developed by Spectral Sensor Solutions (S3), has demonstrated this capability in over ten major field experiments over the past 5 years. S3 has extended the REVEAL capability and developed a multimodal CBD/FP sensor by adding a Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) camera to the system to create an Active SWIR Imaging (ASI) mode. This multimodal system continues to provide the ability to detect/map/track aerosol plumes but includes the capability to switch into active imaging mode to provide 3D images of a region of interest. These 3D images can be combined with the plume measurements to provide an improved picture of the threat environment for decisions regarding force protections and maneuverability of our forces. Additionally, these 3D images can be used to provide ingress/egress route-mapping and obstacle avoidance for UAS-mounted point sensing missions. A significant advantage of the ASI mode compared to visible and standard infrared imaging for ISR is that ASI can image through obscurants and provide images in the presence of background clutter. This multimodal REVEAL-ASI system has been fully integrated, tested and documented as part of an initial Phase II SBIR project. We propose to further enhance this new system capability by focusing on optimization, automation and data integration within existing sensor networks. We also propose to assess the capability of an ASI depolarization measurement to disambiguate UASs from birds. If feasible, this would fill an existing capability gap for all Counter-UAS systems. While this innovative technique has shown promise at ultraviolet wavelengths, we propose to investigate the feasibility in the near infrared. Ultimately, we intend to take part in an integrated system demonstration at a suitable government venue to assess the performance of the enhanced system and validate the utility of the new data products in a networked environment.",Alan  Samuels,,(410) 436-5874,alan.c.samuels4.civ@army.mil,Jeff  Pruitt,,(316) 641-9619,jeff.pruitt@S-3LLC.com,,  ,

Within-species hybrids produced by crossing inbredlines generated from selected wild-type families can substantially improve growth and survivalfor farmed Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas). The Pacific oyster has the highest productionamong shellfish species and can be farmed sustainably with relatively small environmentalimpacts. Hybrid oysters optimized for different growing conditions however are not availableto the shellfish aquaculture industry that has considerable diversity of environmental conditionsand growing methods. An important premise for a crossbreeding program to realize the benefitof hybrid vigor is a repository of selected family lines for production of hybrids. In this projectwe propose to (1) conduct rigorous field trials with multiple industry partners to evaluate theyield of hybrids under different environmental conditions and (2) produce new inbred lines usinga group of wild-type families that have been selected for better field performances. The proposalbuilds on published evidence on hybrid vigor for oysters and established facilities and resourcesof Pacific Hybreed the only commercial shellfish breeding company on the U.S. West Coast.Controlled crosses of genotyped animals will be conducted in our hatcheries to produce hybridlines for field trials during which yield data and environmental parameters variables will becollected. This project will if successful significantly advance our understanding of how differenthybrid lines respond to a variety of farm conditions. Outcomes of this research will contribute todevelopment of elite inbred and hybrid lines with improved yield performances for commercialpropagation and establish important biological resources for use in research.SBIR TOPIC AREA 8.7: AquacultureRESEARCH PRIORITY #2: Genetic improvement crossbreeding and performance evaluation,  ,,,,Francis  Pan,,(626) 241-5325,francis@pacifichybreed.com,,  ,

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) are the most common types
of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). OSA is highly prevalent in the United States, affecting 20-40% of the
adult population and more than 50% of individuals with obesity. Approximately 20% of individuals with
obesity develop OHS defined as daytime hypercapnia and hypoventilation, attributed to the depressed
control of breathing. There is no effective pharmacotherapy for OSA and OHS. Our overarching goal is
to develop a novel, safe, and effective treatment for sleep disordered breathing (SDB). We have
shown that an adipocyte-produced hormone, leptin, which suppresses appetite and increases
metabolic rate, stimulates breathing during sleep. Individuals with obesity have high circulating leptin
levels, but they are resistant to its beneficial metabolic and respiratory effects. Our laboratory has
extensively studies sleep and breathing in mice. We have shown that mice with diet-induced obesity
(DIO) develop OHS and OSA, despite high plasma leptin level. Limited permeability of the blood-brain
barrier (BBB) for leptin is a key mechanism of leptin resistance. Leptin receptor (LEPRb) agonists
engineered to penetrate the BBB are promising therapeutic candidates for SDB treatment. Dr. Laszlo
Otvos has developed E1/Aca, a LEPRb agonist, which has been shown to be BBB permeable and
superior to leptin for weight loss and metabolic dysfunction in mice and rats. We established a
collaboration with Arrevus, which holds a license to E1/Aca, and developed our research plan
to characterize E1/Aca’s potential therapeutic benefit in SDB. We will build upon significant
preliminary data to demonstrate a proof-of-concept for the use of the leptin receptor agonist,
E1/Aca, to treat SDB. Using polysomnography in leptin-resistant diet-induced obese (DIO)
mice, two specific aims will be completed to evaluate the acute (SA1) and chronic (SA2)
activity of E1/Aca in SDB. Specific Aim 1 will characterize the potency of a single
subcutaneous injection of E1/Aca on SDB, compared to leptin. We will evaluate the effect of
escalating doses of E1/Aca on (A) OSA severity (the oxygen desaturation index, the apnea-
hypopnea index, and minute ventilation during sleep) compared to a fixed dose of leptin; (B)
Obesity hypoventilation (arterial CO2 and the hypercapnic ventilatory response awake) compared to
a fixed dose of leptin. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the chronic effects of E1/Aca on SDB
compared to leptin. We will evaluate the potency and safety of the optimal dose of E1/Aca identified
in Aim 1 in DIO mice over a two-week period on (A) SDB severity; (B) Safety by assessing effects of
E1/Aca on CNS, cardiovascular, pulmonary, endocrine, and liver toxicity.",  ,,,,CARL N KRAUS,,(347) 334-2687,ckraus@aceragen.com,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,  ,

Theseso-called ""forever chemicals"" render fields unusable for growing food for human consumption orgrazing livestock leaving small and mid-size farmers with fallow land significant income lossand contaminated property. Another 5000 current or former military bases and major airports havesoil contamination resulting from the use of PFAS-containing firefighting foams. Thiscontamination can migrate to cropland and also effects former base property that has beentransferred to tribal communities. About 3000 PFAS contaminated sites are within 5 miles of triballand boundaries and disproportionately effect disadvantaged communities.In this USDA Phase I STTR project Home Grown Fuels (HGF) and research partner theUniversity at Albany (UAlbany) part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system willdemonstrate PFAS phytoremediation and establish whether the addition of biochar as a soilamendment increases PFAS uptake. HGF will also investigate whether the PFAS in the harvestedplants can be thermally destroyed. The project team will grow hemp and a native grass on PFAS-
contaminated soil amended with different amounts of biochar. Plants will be harvested and soilshoots and roots will be analyzed for 40 PFAS. Resulting plant biomass with the highest PFASconcentrations will be subjected to hydrothermal liquefication at UAlbany using their patentedprocess and treated in a bench scale gasification process to assess PFAS destruction.When fully commercialized HGF's full-circle solution of phytoremediation and PFAS destructionwill be an important tool to remediate contaminated cropland and return it to production across thecountry benefitting small farms. With little training farmers will do what they do best - planttend and harvest crops - to remove PFAS from the soil. Completing the cycle contaminatedbiomass could become feedstock for gasification plants producing biodiesel fuel and more biochar.The economic impact of returning farmland to active use will create jobs and revenue for farmersand farm communities. There is no in-situ PFAS treatment for soil currently on the market and thisapproach will be far less expensive than the only currently available remedy - removing andtransporting the contaminated soil to a hazardous waste landfill. HGFs solution destroys thecontamination rather than simply relocating the problem.HGF submits this STTR application under Topic Area 8.12: Small and Mid-size Farms as itsgoal is to return contaminated cropland to production to support small farms and their surroundingcommunities. This research also directly supports USDA's FY 2022-2025 Strategic Goals. Byreturning land to useful production it ensures that America's agricultural system is resilient andprosperous (Strategic Goal 2) and insures a supply of safe nutritious food (Strategic Goal 4).Making small rural farm and tribal cropland productive again also provides opportunities foreconomic development and improves quality of life in rural and tribal communities often hardesthit by PFAS contamination (Strategic Goal 5).Project Summary/Abstract 1 October 25 2022",  ,,,,Yanna  Liang,,(518) 437-4979,yliang3@albany.edu,University at Albany,  ,

While meeting the majority of the key performance parameters for Range-Gated Imaging at high Pulse Repetition Frequency, improvements can be achieved in transmission, contrast and reliability. The Phase Ii activity begins with a upgraded Electro-optic Shutter incorporating the lessons learned from Phase I testing. Following demonstration of these improvements, a second engineering cycle will produce a EO shutter designed for the temperature range, pressure and ruggedization necessary for high-altitude flight. In parallel to development of the flight-prototype Electro-optic cell, we will develop the Electric Power and Switching System (EPSS). The EPSS produces the nanosecond pulses at high-voltage and high Pulse Repetition Frequency necessary to drive the EO cell. Together, the EO cell and EPSS provide a complete Electro-optic shutter assembly meeting the performance and environmental requirements of NGA-212-001 for range-gated imaging. Two Flight Prototype Range-Gate (FPRG) units will be provided. In parallel to the development of the Flight Prototype Range-Gate EO shutter assemblies, we will develop the Focal Plane Array Shutter (FPAS). The FPAS builds on the Phase I EO Cell to meet the countermeasure objective of NGA-212. Specifically, the objective here iOS to develop a broadband electro-optic shutter capable of providing a variable transmission capability to protect Electrooptic Focal Plane Arrays and sensors from blinding or destruction by incident laser light. Our Phase I cell demonstrated the most difficult objective (bandwidth) and placed us in position to engineer the FPAS unit during Phase II. A full FPAS consisting of the EO Cell and Electric Power and Switching System (FPAS-EPSS) will be developed and testing int he laboratory. The FPAS shall detect incident laser light and rapidly close the shutter to protect the downstream focal plane array. Finally, we intend to develop the third device sought in NGA-212-001, the Laser Pulse Picker (LPP). The laser pulse picker exhibits requirements radically different in terms of angular acceptance, laser damage threshold, etc from the Electro-optic shutters for range-gated imaging and/or EO sensor protection. As a result, we will develop a fast Electro-optic cell for this specific purpose. We will complete the Critical Design of the Laser Pulse Picker. If sufficient funds and schedule remain after completion of the FPRG and FPAS, we will build and test the LPP in the laboratory during Phase Ii.  ",Charlie  Kershner,,(571) 557-2696,Charles.M.Kershner@nga.mil,Madison  Perry,,(858) 401-2573,Madison.Perry@TPEngin.net,,  ,

If non-biodegradable plastics could be reused as high-quality plastics positiveimpacts on the environment could be realized. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is accumulating inthe environment at a staggering rate. Recycling of PET plastics in current methods requires themelting and reformation of a new plastic causing loss of function in the product. If PET isdegraded to its monomers it could be repolymerized into new plastic without the reduction inquality. Industrial enzymes could fulfill this function.Objectives: GreenLab Inc. proposes to use the corn kernel biofactory to commercialize plasticdegrading enzymes. PHL7 identified and cloned from a compost bin can degrade PET intomonomers at a commercially viable rate. The corn biofactory will produce this new enzyme.Effort: The maize-optimized PHL7 gene vectors will be moved into A. tumefaciens and transientlytransformed into maize embryos. A high-throughput assay will be developed to test activity of thesesmall amounts of enzyme. Active enzyme vectors will be transformed stably into corn for Phase IIdevelopment.Results and commercial applications: Phase I is the first step in this process by introducing thePETase transiently into corn prior to full scale stable expression and use. We will partner with aplastic recycling/reuse company to commercialize the enzyme.

Swine IAV infections represent an enormous economic loss to producers and canresult in acute respiratory disease and severe pathology when acting in concert with otherpathogens. Zoonotic transmissions between pigs and humans are a threat to both human healthand animal production with spillover events and viral evolution leading to increased diversity.There are three major swine IAV subtypes (H1N1 H1N2 and H3N2) and ~10 distinctHemagglutinin (HA) genes co-circulating within U.S. swine herds. Repeated outbreaks and rapidspread of genetically and antigenically distinct IAVs represent a considerable challenge foreffective swine IAV control. The major problems with current commercially available swineIAV vaccines are 1) the challenge of updating vaccines faster than the rate of viral evolution 2)the time needed for approval and licensing of updated vaccines 3) maternal antibodyinterference and 4) the lack of an adequate mucosal and cell-mediated immune response. Thereis an unmet need for closely matched efficacious vaccines that are updated and produced rapidly.The overall goal of this multi-phase SBIR project is to design develop validate andcommercialize a system for more-effective swine IAV control that can be utilized byveterinarians and producers. Genvax Technologies' Phase I project is designed to show it isfeasible to develop the Genvax Sequence Database and Genvax Prescription self-amplifyingRNA (saRNA) Vaccine Platform. Genvax will conduct swine IAV surveillance in productionfacilities and incorporate the collected sequence data into a centralized repository. The GenvaxSequence Database will be used to create predictive machine-learning (ML) models of viralevolution to improve vaccine design. We will create the first system that allows individualproducers to have predictive analytics for viral changes within their farm. Using swine IAV HAsequences from Iowa Farms in 2018 as input we could accurately predict sequences occurringfor the following two years (2019-2020). We propose that with more producer-specific data wecould train customized ML models for individual production systems or farms and forecast theprevalence and diversity of swine IAV strains up to 12 months into the future. For Objective 2we will attempt to prove the feasibility of the Genvax Prescriptive Vaccine Platform by creatinga prescriptive saRNA nanoparticle vaccine that is designed based on producer-specificsurveillance data within a 4 week turn-around time. Vaccine efficacy will be demonstrated withan in vivo study in pigs. Genvax has fully completed 5 preliminary swine IAV vaccine efficacyproof-of-concept studies in pigs. Briefly pigs vaccinated with saRNA nanoparticle vaccines withHA as the gene of interest generated protective levels of immunity as demonstrated by highHemagglutination Inhibition assay titers and protection from viral challenge.The Genvax team has a long history of entrepreneurship and innovative research. Co-investigatorHank Harris founded Harrisvaccines which developed innovative RNA particle technology thatwas a breakthrough in vaccine development. Genvax technology uses a cell-free encapsulationsystem based on nanoparticle saRNA vaccine delivery. Our goal is to help protect livestock fromcurrent and emerging infectious diseases by providing better solutions to veterinarians andproducers by commercializing our innovative technologies. The global animal health market isprojected to be over $13.6 billion by 2026 with swine vaccines representing $1.8 billion. Asuccessful SBIR project and USDA approval of our vaccine platform will allow Genvax topursue the $400 million U.S. swine vaccine market that includes targeting swine IAV and otherimportant swine pathogens.

Most commercial vanilla
production has been offshored. The U.S. manufacturers that utilize natural vanilla must import this
crop but this material often has issues with high prices inconsistent supply chains variation in
quality and imparts a heavy toll on local people and ecosystems where it is produced.
We aim to solve the current issues with vanilla by the development of a commercial Vanilla planifolia
plant cell culture. The liquid culture of plants is an established technology in which plants are grown
as a fine suspension of small clumps or single cells. Unlike V. planifolia plants an V. planifolia cell
culture can be domestically-produced in a safe and high quality way without pesticides or adulterants.
Chi Botanic has recently established a V. planifolia cell culture.
Our objective for this Phase I proposal is to increase the vanillin content of our vanilla plant cell
cultures so they can be used in fragrances foods drinks and cosmetics. To increase the vanillin
content of our V. planifolia plant cell cultures we aim to (1) identify environmental variables elicitors
and chemicals that turn on vanillin biosynthesis (2) use fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to
isolate plant cell lines that have increased vanillin content (3) quantitate levels of vanillin in isolated
lines and (4) generate a fluorescent reporter that correlates to the expression of the vanillin
biosynthetic pathway.
Our high-throughput approaches will explore more V. planifolia genotype-phenotype and
environment-phenotype space than ever before. This research will establish V. planifolia cell culture
technology as an innovative and domestic way to produce vanilla.",  ,,,,Jonathan E Meuser,,(858) 365-0434,jon@chibotanic.com,,  ,

Finding suitable geological storage sites, demonstrating effective CO2 containment, and establishing long-term monitoring of storage reservoirs are paramount to effective and safe storage of CO2. The risk of CO2 leakage can be reduced through real- time monitoring and early prediction of possible leaks. Early prediction of leaks involves identifying the onset of a leak and immediately visualizing the potential migration pathways. At present this goal is not achievable by available technologies like seismic inversion on time-lapse seismic data because the inversion process typically takes weeks to months, and the results are not reusable for newly acquired data. This limits its applicability to provide value for agile decision making that is critical for CO2 storage management. In addition, evaluating the CO2 concentration within the plume is desired to improve the storage efficiency and overall economy of carbon management operations. In this proposed research work, we plan to incorporate the large amounts of multiscale and multimodal data available in EDX for various formations to create machine learning-aided rock physics models. The aim is to use the data in the EDX platform to develop an end-to-end mapping between the rock and seismic properties. Based on the change in rock properties, the CO2 plume migration path can be readily visualized. Rock physics modeling (RPM) development is driven by data availability; therefore, this study is only possible with a wide variety of data available in EDX for various storage formations. One of the biggest challenges in the RPM is different uncertainties in the model. While rock physics modeling forms the skeleton of what connects rock and seismic properties, supervised machine learning models become an essential component to reduce the uncertainties between the properties’ mapping and improving the accuracy of the models. Thus, we advocate a physics-based machine learning approach to RPM. The proposed CarbonWatch technology has huge economic and technological benefits, while minimizing adverse environmental impacts. In upcoming Phase II of the project, we will first improve the CO2 saturation estimation from seismic data by adding dispersion and attenuation into the rock physics modeling to increase the model sensitivity to fluid saturation. We will apply the workflow to real seismic data and develop its capability to deal with noises. We also plan to expand the concept to other data types like Distributed Acoustic Sensors (DAS) to further raised its applicability for real-time monitoring. Finally, we will develop the software package and commercialize the technology as a field-ready product.",  ,,,,Qiuliang  Yao,,(713) 858-0005,julian.yao@petrolern.com,,  ,

Plastic recycling rates in the United States have been stagnant for more than a decade: less than 10% of plastics are currently recycled, and only 5.5% of polyurethane plastics are recycled. Plastics have become a major contributor to global warming, as emissions from global plastics production and incineration are expected to account for 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The economics of conventional plastic recycling are poor, as high temperatures are frequently used to recycle plastics, resulting in degradation of plastic quality that greatly reduces the economic value of recycled plastics. This proposal uses synthetic biology to design, engineer, and optimize new enzymes to break down polyurethane plastic waste for recycling and upcycling into new, high value plastic products. In Phase I of this research, naturally occurring polyurethanase enzymes were identified and engineered to improve their ability to break down polyurethane polymers under scalable recycling conditions. Importantly, these engineered enzymes re-generate the building block chemicals that are used to manufacture polyurethane plastics today, enabling manufacture of 100% recycled polyurethane plastics using chemicals recovered from enzyme-mediated polyurethane decomposition. This Phase II proposal is focused on further improving the economics of enzyme-mediated polyurethane recycling through continued improvement of high-performance polyurethanase enzymes. In addition, this proposal seeks to demonstrate high yield recycling of polyurethanes under scalable, industrial conditions as a demonstration of the robustness and favorable technoeconomics of enzyme-mediated recycling of polyurethane plastics. The 2020 market for plastic recycling was $1.7 billion in the United States and $26.5 billion globally. High- performance engineered enzymes and bioprocess technology will accelerate growth of this industry and mitigate the unsustainable manufacture of virgin polyurethanes from oil and gas, including the downstream landfilling of polyurethanes with their associated environmental contamination and carbon emissions. Improved economics of plastic recycling will motivate materials recovery facilities to invest in polyurethane recycling infrastructure, as enzyme-mediated polyurethane recycling could save millions of dollars in shipping and dumping fees. Societal and environmental benefits resulting from reductions in oil consumption and carbon emissions will accelerate as these technologies are implemented. Importantly, market growth will be spurred by governmental policies designed to encourage efficient, circular plastic recycling, such as national taxation of carbon emissions, state requirements for minimum recycled plastic content in packaging and other materials, and producer responsibilities for the fate of plastic products.",  ,,,,Johan  Kers,,(650) 575-8427,jkers@birchbiosciences.com,,  ,

This Phase II proposal is to validate the Phase I design of a turnkey seismic monitoring service by installing and operating such a system for an active carbon injection facility. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a key element in the USA’s carbon emissions reduction strategy.

The purpose of this proposal is to support the development of a turnkey microseismic monitoring service that would help ensure the safe operation of industrial scale CO2 storage facilities.

Recent advances in sensing and machine learning technologies are opening up the possibility for “smart sensor” approaches to automation and optimization of data collection and analysis. Such novel approaches, if commercialized and widely available, could provide invaluable information in support of the DOE BER mission to develop predictive and quantitative models that contribute to the Nation’s goal of maintaining and strengthening our energy and infrastructure security, independence, and prosperity. Building on demonstrated expertise with robust, field-deployable sensors, the goal of this proposal is to develop and demonstrate the technical feasibility of a phosphorus sensor that can reliably provide real-time, continuous, quantitative measurements of phosphorus from multiple field sources with a single instrument. In Phase I, we demonstrated technical feasibility by developing the phosphorus sensor and characterizing its response under a variety of conditions and phosphorus inductions. We used our platform to collect hours of calibration data and to develop computational tools to correlate fluorescent signals with phosphorus levels. In Phase II, we propose a two-year work plan that will result in a robust, field-deployable biosensor platform that can detect and discern phosphorus species in harsh outdoor environments and in complex water backgrounds. In addition, by performing field trials with partners in two different disciplines, we aim to demonstrate the value that our sensor can provide to a diverse range of applications including environmental monitoring and industrial process control. Beyond addressing a need for improved data, the proposed sensor platform could have a broader societal impact on the widespread availability of safe drinking water. Access to clean, reliable water supplies is critical to our quality of life and our economy, yet across the country millions of Americans are impacted by groundwater that doesn’t meet drinking water standards. Phosphorus is a particularly prevalent water pollutant that impacts countless freshwater systems around the world, which can undergo eutrophication under high phosphorus inputs, causing environmental and economic damage to the local region. Widespread efforts to address this water crisis will necessitate an investment in advanced sensing technologies. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to commercialize a robust sensor that not only meets the needs of the DOE BER program and the growing needs for technologies to ensure safe drinking water but is also broadly marketable. A key partnership with a commercial partner has been established to develop a rapid market entry strategy.

Technologies are also needed for direct and in situ measurements of greenhouse gases, CO2 and CH4 for environmental monitoring. For in situ and real-time measurements, we employed a DOE patented split laser measurement technology (SLMT) for laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) to measure elemental species (Na, Ca and Sr) and Raman spectroscopy to measure CO2 and CH4 under harsh environmental conditions. A significant part of the effort was devoted to the upgrade of the current SLMT by incorporating innovative packaging and sealing of the sensor head for ruggedness and to withstand the harsh environments anticipated during underwater and downhole sensing applications. We successfully built a compact and sealed prototype split laser that delivered high-energy nanosecond pulses and was able to perform LIBS experiments for species detection of Na, Ca, Sr, Eu, and Yb and obtain limits of detection on the level of 10~25 parts per million in aqueous solutions. Different combinations of spectral analyzers and photon detectors were tested, thereby permitting a study on the relative performance and cost analyses. Raman spectroscopy was also successfully demonstrated to detect dissolved CO2 in water. Based on the promising results obtained during Phase I, we will continue to refine the split laser to further enhance its performance and built three sensors – a LIBS sensor, a NIR Raman sensor, and a NIR cavity enhanced Raman spectroscopy (CERS) sensor, for in situ, standoff monitoring of trace metals and dissolved gases in water and validate its performance using laboratory experiments and field tests deep underground in downhole configuration. The validation of these sensors using field tests will lead to the development of rugged sensors that are capable of field deployment. Further refinement of these rugged sensors will lead to mature products that can be commercialized. The proposed system will support laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and Raman scattering measurements of gases, liquids, and solids. There is a great need in providing an inexpensive and compact measurement device suitable for real-time assessment of air, water, and soil quality, which is highly important to oil and gas exploration companies, landowners, regulatory agencies, municipalities, and any organization measuring emissions and pollutants.",  ,,,,Jacob  George,,(949) 553-0688,jgeorge@metrolaserinc.com,,  ,

Processes of interest for bioenergy include measuring enzyme function within cells, tracking metabolic pathways in vivo, monitoring the transport of materials into and out of cells or across cellular membranes and, measuring signaling process between cells and within plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions. High-utility organic products (biofuels, biochemicals, biomaterials, etc.) are most effectively produced by way of industrial fermentation enabled by microorganisms such as bacteria, yeast, and fungi. End-product synthesis begins with genetically engineered microbial strains with redirected metabolic paths which either increase the yield of natural metabolites or produce new molecules. Because bioprocess scale-up costs are extremely high, reliable scale-up remains an enormous technical and economic barrier for commercialization of bioprocesses. To provide insight into the metabolic process with the goal of increasing yield, single-cell NMR sensors based on nanodiamond (ND) particles with unique quantum properties are being developed. 13C nuclear spins in nanodiamond will be employed as NMR sensors of the surrounding analyte nuclei. Hyperpolarization of 13C nuclei boost their NMR signal and increase the capability to measure the NMR chemical shift of potential analytes present in nearby hyperpolarized 13C nuclei. Products that will result from this research include a single-cell NMR detector, consisting of a 13C hyperpolarization module and RF detection module, along with the diamond particles that are used by the device.

Through thermal processing this biomass can be converted to a high carbon biochar that could be used as a soil amendment for acidic soils to increase crop production. However, current biochar costs are too high. By coproducing a biofuel with the biochar, biochar costs can be reduced. A patented drop-in biofuels process will be leveraged to also create a low-cost biochar. In addition, carbon dioxide will be adsorbed on the biochar to improve soil amendment characteristics. The goal of the proposed project is to build a larger-scale enhanced biochar production system and operate the system to generate enhanced biochar for improving Controlled Environmental Agriculture (CEA) operations and improve the growth of corn and wheat in field applications in acidic soils. During the Phase I project, the enhanced biochar test system was designed and fabricated, and biochar was produced from corn stover and wheat straw. The biochar was characterized by standard tests and was shown to have good carbon dioxide capture potential and good potential for long-term carbon sequestration. Lettuce plant growth tests under Controlled Environmental Agriculture conditions in pots showed that the enhanced biochar could increase plant production in acidic media by up to 386%. A techno-economic analysis showed that these benefits could be achieved at a cost below $40/ton biochar. In the Phase II project, the enhanced biochar production system will be scaled up by a factor of ten to produce larger quantities of biochar. The corn stover and wheat straw biochar will then be applied to controlled environment agriculture pot studies in the first year of the effort to show the growth improvements with enhanced biochar. In the second year of the project, the enhanced biochar will be applied in field studies to show the growth improvement with corn and wheat in acidic soils. The project will conclude with a techno-economic analysis to show the cost, agricultural production and carbon sequestration benefits of enhanced biochar. The enhanced biochar can be applied to increase the productivity of crops in acidic soils and replacing peat in the soilless media used for controlled environmental agriculture. This will improve the economic well-being of farmers, reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, sequester carbon in soil and generate drop-in jet or gasoline renewable fuel. Preliminary results indicate farm revenues can be increased by $8.8 billion/year and 11.4 million tons of carbon can be sequestered in the soil.",  ,,,,Nehru  Chevanan,,(408) 328-8318,nehru@altextech.com,,  ,

A critical factor affecting cloud characteristics is the concentration of airborne particles around which cloud droplets form. A significant contributor to these particles is atmospheric nucleation, which injects large numbers of small particles into the atmosphere. Once formed, these particles grow quickly. It is estimated that these nucleation processes and the subsequent particle growth are significant contributors to the number of cloud condensation nuclei, and subsequent cloud formation. Characterizing particle nucleation events, and the dynamics of the evolution of the particle size distribution, is important to improving our understanding of global climate. Yet current observations are limited by size, cost, and the relatively slow pace of the measurement. This is due, in part, to the low charging efficiency in the sub-10nm regime, which leads to long measurement times to obtain sufficient counting statistics. Needed is a compact, rapid-response instrument that can accurately track the evolution in size and concentration of newly formed particles. This project will develop a new measurement system to provide the tools needed to better characterize the physical dynamics associated with these new particle formation events. This system consists of two coupled instruments, one which is quick to sense an atmospheric nucleation event, and one that has the precision to characterize it. The rapidly responding instrument is a Nano-Particle Counter which continuously reports particle concentrations in two nanoparticle size ranges, approximately 2nm-10nm, and 10nm and larger. The precise instrument is an “adaptable” differential mobility analyzer that measures aerosol size distributions based on electrical mobility. This adaptable differential mobility analyzer has several modes of operation, with the capability, in one instrument, to measure freshly nucleated, nanometer sized particles as well as the larger pre-existing aerosol with which these newly formed particles interact. Its “adaptability” is the capacity to readily switch among these size ranges. These two components are coupled through common control, whereby an abundance of 2-10 nm particles that is characteristic of an atmospheric nucleation event triggers the mobility sizing system to direct its measurements to this important nucleation mode. Having demonstrated the efficacy of each of these two approaches, the effort of this project focuses on extending these capabilities, with refinement based on modeling and experimental verification. The instruments will be coupled with common control to provide a single, adaptive measurement system. Adaptive protocols, as well as the instrument components, will be further refined under field testing in conjunction with another air quality measurement program. In addition to the automated adaptive system for studying atmospheric nucleation events, this SBIR project will produce two new instruments, a flexible differential mobility analyzer and a dual size range nanoparticle counter, both of which will see broad application within, and outside of, atmospheric aerosol research.",  ,,,,Stavros  Amanatidis,,(510) 649-9360,stavros@aerosol.us,,  ,

The Navy has operational dependance on aerial refueling and has significant need to improve the simulation fidelity of this flight regime to develop, test, and certify its equipment, aircraft, and procedures in a laboratory environment. In response to this need, a unique application of a classical vortex lattice, aerodynamic modeling method (dubbed “incremental vortex lattice method, IVLM”) was employed to compute tanker-induced force and moment increments from a pre-solved CFD tanker wake velocity field. The use of this computationally compact methodology and simple planar receiver model enables real-time summation of these tanker interference effects onto any existing receiver aerodynamic model without a priori knowledge of that underlying model. Correlation with experimental aerial refueling datasets and pilot-in-the-loop evaluations have shown that the technology effectively models real-world tanker effects and adds valuable fidelity to the simulation.

The Helium Flow Meter, proven to work in Phase I, measures extra heat generated by contaminants inside the cavity by measuring increased evaporation of helium from the cooling bath in which the cavity is immersed. With this easily performed measurement, accelerator operators would turn down the unhealthy cavities and turn up healthy cavities, maintaining the rated beam energy of their accelerator while reducing excess radiation in the accelerator from the contaminated cavities and excessive load on the Cryogenic Plant. Conventional flow meters, with weak signals at the operating temperature of ~2 to 4 K and pressure of 0.03 atmospheres, have all been proven not to work in trials over 35 years. The Hyperboloid Helium Flow Meter uses the switch capability of a superconducting wire to turn highly resistive at ~10 K to give a strong signal. The higher the flow, which removes heat, the greater the current through an adjacent heater wire is needed to trip to the non-superconducting state. The electronics detects this changed state and software keeps track of the heater current. Phase I showed that the recorded heater current can measure the helium flow with good resolution. Phase II will install Flow Meters in the helium return gas flows of 5 of the 53 accelerating units at the Jefferson Lab’s CEBAF Accelerator. Over the two-year period, the Instrument Head, the electronics, the software and the use by Operators will be improved so that at the end of the second period, Hyperboloid will be able to offer a commercial product that the SRF Community, in the US, as well as the rest of the World, can rely on. Hyperboloid will investigate what changes to the Instrument Head are necessary to make the flow meter useful for the public purpose in the cryogenic realm where instruments are scarce.

Low energy electron microscopes (LEEM) provide an exquisitely sensitive surface imaging technique, capable of imaging single atomic layers with high contrast. Commonly used electron sources limit the performance of these techniques because the electrons are emitted with a relatively large energy spread (0.25-1eV), which limits the energy resolution of spectroscopic techniques like EELS and makes techniques like LEEM susceptible to chromatic aberrations. Monochromators have been developed to reduce the energy spread to as low as 5-10 meV; however, the filtering of the energy distribution also dramatically reduces the beam current to below 1 pA. As a result, these instruments suffer from long acquisition times, which constrain their practical applications to niche areas. Furthermore, there is great interest in reducing the energy spread further, down to 1 meV, which would open up new opportunities in the spectroscopic characterization of materials. The monochromator proposed in this project incorporates a novel electron source that is currently being developed in a collaborative effort with researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and Kimball Physics. Initial results have shown that this electron source equipped with a superconducting Nb emitter can produce a beam of electrons with an energy spread as low as 15 meV. The novel electron source is combined with an energy-dispersive, magnetic beam separator with an electrostatic electron mirror and a knife-edge aperture to filter the electron beam. In phase I, a detailed opto-mechanical design of a monochromator was completed. The results have demonstrated that the proposed monochromator will reduce the energy spread of emitted electrons to 1 meV while delivering a beam current exceeding 10 pA, and to 3 meV while delivering a beam current of more than 300 pA: beam current values that are 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than those achievable by state-of-the-art approaches. In phase II, EOI aims to build, assemble, and integrate the components of the monochromator monochromator and test the prototype using a standard emitter. EOI will then work with Dr. Minor’s group to integrate the monochromator with the liquid He instrumentation required for the superconducting Nb emitter and verify experimentally its performance utilizing LBNL's high resolution electron spectrometer. The simultaneous reduction in the energy spread and increase in the beam current of the probing electron beam will enable the direct imaging of vibrational modes using EELS, the study of band gaps and defects in semiconductors with sub-nanometer resolution, as well as the detailed study of low-loss structures in materials such as metal nanoparticles, solar cells, and organic materials. The high coherence of the monochromatic beam will benefit novel techniques of multipass-transmission electron microscopy and quantum electron microscopy.",  ,,,,Marian  Mankos,,(415) 706-1557,marian@electronoptica.com,,  ,

Although Li-ion battery prices have fallen over the past three decades, they are threatening to rise higher as Li-ion production for electric vehicles is predicted to consume the world’s high-grade cobalt and nickel ores while the only ready cathode alternative, lithium iron phosphate, makes the batteries heavier and more expensive. This proposal is stepping up to the challenge by developing a cobalt free, water-based sodium-air battery that can store 2-3x the energy of Li-ion, with 1/10th the nickel, while using sodium from the oceans and oxygen from the air which will enable this battery to scale to power electric vehicles and renewable energy storage for everyone. The objective of this Phase II project is to validate the technical feasibility of the technology and culminate with a finalized full cell and performance testing. The project will begin by optimizing the membrane synthesis to ensure reproducibility of results over a large area. Protective coatings for the solid electrolyte will then be optimized for stability and scalability. Additionally, we’ll develop novel low-cost OER and ORR electrodes designed for long life, high efficiency and scalability. The appropriate operating conditions will be determined to ensure a long cycle life for the catalysts chosen. The Phase II work will involve optimizing both the catalysts for the air electrodes and the cell design for performance and manufacturability. Once accomplished, full cell assembly and testing will be undertaken. When carried through over into Phase III, the aqueous Na-Air battery will give a viable energy source for large-scale electric aircraft EVs a 2-3x longer range for an affordable price while allowing electric cars to fast charge without fear of fire from overcharging and thermal runaway. The scalability of the battery will allow homes and cities to be powered with clean, renewable energy on demand to provide energy cheaper than coal and gas.

This contamination can have significant effects in sensitive areas such as terrestrial aquatic interfaces (TAIs) where the flux of nutrients can change over a relatively short period of time leading to hypoxia and the formation of harmful algal blooms. Researchers and other stakeholders have not been able to adequately monitor these potentially dangerous nutrient fluctuations because of limitations in the monitoring equipment currently available. This knowledge gap will be addressed with the development of a phosphate monitoring system that is robust, accurate and capable of making frequent measurements. Our approach is to adapt and integrate our cutting-edge technologies into a robust, modular micro-fluidic platform. With a micro-fluidic based system, the resulting instrument will be extremely portable and require minimal resources for long-term autonomous operation. In Phase I of this project, an automated instrument was designed, built, and used to detect orthophosphate over a wide dynamic range (0.03 mg/L to 18 mg/L). More significantly, this instrument was able to operate in a variety of challenging situations where other portable instruments do not function accurately. These challenging environments include: 1) water with high sediment concentration and high total suspended solids; 2) locations where biofouling is a problem; 3) water with a high concentration of chemicals that interfere with the phosphate assay chemistry; and 4) locations with shallow boreholes or streams. All three of these challenging scenarios have been addressed in the Phase I work toward an autonomous, robust and field-deployable orthophosphate analyzer. In Phase II of this project, a modular instrument based on our work in Phase I will be developed, manufactured, and deployed in the field. The main module will consist of the optofluidic and sample- handling systems. Another module will contain reagents and waste necessary for the phosphate assay and instrument maintenance. The final module will contain the power and communication systems that will allow researchers to stream data from the instrument in real time. This modular system allows the user to customize the instrument depending on their specific needs. With these features the instrument will be deployable for months at a time without maintenance. Parties from the private sector that would be interested in the development of the proposed instrument include environmental researchers in both academia and industries that conduct continuous water/process monitoring. Ultimately, we believe that the proposed product is both highly marketable and has a high likelihood of attracting further funding from large instrument companies already involved in water monitoring.",  ,,,,Brooks  Hornstein,,(408) 475-0084,B.Hornstein@LeidenTechnology.com,,  ,

Unlike the concentrations of REEs in natural water sources, reported to be between 15 – 710 ng/L, the concentrations of REEs in the aforementioned unconventional sources is reported to be between 50 – 380 &#181;g/L. Furthermore, generation of sludges from fracking operations have appreciable amounts of rare earths present as well, our data shows some sludges may contain 1 – 5 ppm, and literature values show concentrations of up to 380 ppm in produced water sludges. Therefore, sludges offer a significant increase in REE concentration relative to cation concentrations in produced water. Therefore, these waste streams are of particular interest as a source of these valuable REEs. GlycoSurf, Inc. will continue to build on its Phase I successes for recovering rare earths from fracking sludge. GlycoSurf’s Phase I results showed that our surfactant-based ligands are capable of binding with rare earths to extract and recover them from fracking waste materials. During our Phase I project, we have validated our ion flotation approach, as well as a novel approach for surfactant-enhanced sludge washing (SESW). Multiple glycolipid surfactants were shown to have excellent ability to bind with rare earths both in solution or loosely bound to sludge. We have preliminary data that establishes the capability to achieve REEs recovery using these techniques, which will be a major focus of our proposed Phase II project. The metals recovery utilized ligands developed from two classes: (1) rhamnolipids and (2) xylolipids. Both of these classes of ligands were synthetized by GlycoSurf, Inc. At the end of Phase I, the technology is currently at a TRL 3. During the first year of Phase II, GlycoSurf will develop a robust process for SESW as a stand-alone process at the bench-scale to understand the boundary conditions associated with maximum metals recovery to advance the technology through TRL 4. In parallel, GlycoSurf will implement certain aspects of continuous flow chemistry to increase the production of the necessary glycolipids used in this project.

Challenges within microscopy labs are heightened due to complex and powerful microscopy techniques. While localized efforts have addressed disparate data standards, no large-scale, cloud-enabled collaborative tool exists, and the manual annotation of imagery makes data difficult to index, organize, and reference. Few standard data-sharing tools are available, and data-sharing principles in microscopy are severely lacking. Conventional, time-consuming practices remain prevalent, including sharing research findings solely via publication and only upon request. Some researchers have built their own, home-grown solutions. Metadata is often incomplete and data management suffers, as discovered during Phase I interviews conducted with scientists, researchers, and other potential end-users. Working with scientific research facilities, an architecture of the tool, designed to maximize findability of data, was developed. A cloud-deployable web application to store metadata on microscopy datasets was designed, and wireframes for a user interface were approved. Using a machine learning model, a data ingestion pipeline was implemented to minimize collaboration obstacles between researchers. Phase II will focus on a second pipeline component – an automatic tagging machine learning model. The platform has been designed to implement the following key characteristics in the Phase II effort: automated ingestion, applicability across file types, cloud storage and access, automated metadata tagging, data cataloging, automated attribution, user access control, automated curation, and accessibility to previously “dark” data. Improved collaboration and data availability will save time and money, and will also help to validate research results, enabling the combination of data types and the reuse of hard-to-generate data, accelerating ideas for future research, and benefiting data sharers.

One of the known limitations of the software is a lack of multi-threaded support for accessing data. This creates adoption, deployment and performance barriers for multi-threaded applications, especially for machine learning applications.

More problematic is the poor performance portability of applications between platforms, forcing site-specific re-engineering of codes. Existing solutions to deployment of AI/ML work?ows on commercial cloud environments are platform-specific, preventing migration from one cloud provider to another. This project proposes to address the problem by combining the use of an integrated stack of HPC software, which provides multi-platform container images, with a highly performant and performance-portable Message Passing Interface (MPI) library for fast, inter-and intra- node communication on four cloud platforms, made available through a platform-neutral interface. Phase I has evaluated the feasibility of this solution and built prototypes for evaluation. We made improvements to an MPI implementation to support high-performance deployments of MPI applications on cloud platforms; built high-performance versions of commonly usedDeep Learning frameworks for cloud deployment; made use of high-speed network adapters and accelerators within the cloud environments; and evaluated the use of a platform-neutral web interface for deployment on a cloud vendor. In Phase II, the proof-of-concept developed in Phase I will be ported to three additional cloud platforms, and the high-performance MPI implementation will be tuned for each of these platforms. All four supported plat- forms will be made available through a single platform-neutral interface. The ability to use the Phase II product to easily port an application from traditional HPC clusters to all four cloud platforms will be demonstrated. The success of the project will deliver a productive platform for transitioning important HPC applications (many developed in National Laboratories) to more accessible cloud based HPC platforms in a portable manner while retaining high performance. It will be beneficial to practically all scalable HPC applications ranging from modeling and simulation to AI/ML, where advance message communication hardware and access to accelerator technologies are being more commonly supported in commercial cloud systems. In particular, data analytics and deep learning are areas of high growth and of benefit to a broad range of industries.

The salts are used to transfer heat from the reacting fuel. All designs describe a chemically stable salt with a melting point near 500&#176;C, heated by the nuclear reaction to a temperature near 700&#176;C. Operation of a heat- exchange loop requires monitoring salt properties. The oxidizing chemical environment corrodes reactor components, conduits, vessels, and valves. Real-time measurement of the salt reduction and oxidation (RedOx) is needed as a “health monitor”. To monitor corrosion, thermodynamic reference electrode (RE) potentials must be correlated to potentials produced by durable electrode materials. A rugged health monitoring instrument that measures and compares multiple RE potentials accelerates the study of electrode behaviors to produce a reliable, long-term measurement of the salt RedOx state. Ozark IC is a leader in the development of extreme-environment electronics, making breakthroughs for high-temperature environments with recent demonstrations up to 800&#176;C. The University of Wisconsin, College of Engineering (UWCE) is uniquely capable of, and an acknowledged expert in, producing high- purity salts such as LiF-NaF-KF (46.5-11.5-42 mol%) (FLiNaK) for determining molten salt properties. Ozark IC and UWCE propose to develop an instrument for real-time comparison of reactive thermodynamic reference electrode potentials in FLiNaK+NiF2[3] to non-reactive electrode potentials such as a AlN/Au.

This result intersected with a material study performed by Ozark IC using thick film printed electrode conductors on the same material, determining the key feasibility of creating both conventionally machined and film-miniaturized electrodes for a comparative study in Phase II. Ozark IC was able to manufacture a suitable electrode potential amplification circuit that was successfully temperature- hardened to 200&#176;C validating the efficacy of the readout. Ozark IC will incrementally harden the electronics to temperature through Year-1 to Year-2. UWCE/ANL will design conventional electrodes and measure the potentials to confirm feasibility of the instrument. Short-term measurements (24-48 hours) of electrode potentials will be performed to validate Nernstian behavior in FLiNaK. Commercial applications include the development of molten salt heat exchange loops, high-temperature chemical analysis, and geothermal well logging.",  ,,,,James  Holmes,,(479) 935-1600,holmes@ozarkic.com,,  ,

The proposed development will improve the energy resolution 3x further, extending the field to new areas including quantum information technology. A new type of electron monochromator, used together with a new spectrometer developed with SBIR support, has revolutionized electron energy loss spectroscopy in the electron microscope, by improving the energy resolution from 30-40 meV to 3 meV. This has led to vibrational spectroscopy with atomic resolution, orders of magnitude smaller than was possible previously. Applications include detecting the vibrations of a single Si atom, damage-free mapping of light atomic species including hydrogen, mapping the substitution of 12C by 13C in biological samples, and many more. If the energy resolution were improved further into the 1-2 meV range, the application space would grow into the field of quantum materials, and other fields of physics and biology. In Phase I, the limits of the first-generation monochromator were analyzed, and a second-generation monochromator with improved optics for better energy resolution was designed. In Phase II, the new design will be built and tested, with the goal of improving the energy resolution another factor of three. Phase II work will use theoretical modeling performed in Phase I phase to build and optimize a second- generation ground-potential monochromator. It will have major new features such as: more precise aberration correction (to 5th order), improved stability, higher immunity to noise (electronic, mechanical, and magnetic Johnson) and advanced, user-friendly autotuning software. A definitive experiment will be conducted to quantify the effect of magnetic Johnson noise, the random magnetic fields arising from the motion of thermal electrons, and its findings will be used to minimize the influence of the noise on the energy resolution. A new operating mode, developed in Phase I, will allow beam currents up to 100 pA and higher without compromising meV-level energy resolution. A monochromator is the key part of the spectroscopy system, but the spectrometer is just as important. We will update the spectrometer too, using the same principles as the new monochromator design. The total system performance, especially aberration correction and immunity to noise, will be optimized for the whole microscope system. The proposed development will enable new types of experiments and open a new frontier for researchers around the world who invest in this technology. It will also secure and extend a key technological lead of the only US-based electron microscope manufacturer.",  ,,,,Tracy  Lovejoy,,(425) 576-9060,lovejoy@nion.com,,  ,

However, these goals are limited by the current state of the art of domestic manufacture and metrology of diffraction-limited x-ray mirrors, specifically those for synchrotron applications. This proposal outlines a set of novel manufacturing processes based on a robotic platform that aim to eliminate the pseudo-periodic signature of existing sub-aperture manufacturing techniques. This signature is detrimental to the performance of x- ray mirrors. Through novel pad, path, and optimization techniques, the proposed technique eliminates the signature and readies the surface for final finishing with ion beam figuring. The Phase I effort demonstrated feasibility of the robotic smoothing techniques to remove manufacturing signatures of single-point diamond turning. Several different smoothing pad and slurry compound combinations were tested. A three-step process was formulated, first removing mid-spatial frequency errors, followed by two steps to reduce the surface roughness. Reduction in mid-spatial frequency errors was demonstrated, and sub-0.3 nm surface roughness achieved. In the end, the diamond turning process was not deemed adequately scalable. Therefore, a separate “grolish” process (using the same robotic platform but with different tooling) was devised to address initial grinding signature while also performing some correction of form error. Initial tests show feasibility of the approach. The Phase II effort will build upon the results of the Phase I effort. The work plan addresses the size and ultimate precision required for synchrotron x-ray optics, thereby advancing the state of the art and creating a domestic source for ultra-precision x-ray mirrors. Commercial applications of the proposed technology extend beyond high-precision synchrotron mirrors. Mirrors with improved precision are needed for upcoming space missions, some of which require hundreds, if not thousands, of individual mirrors. Improved silicon polishing and smoothing techniques are also required for directed energy mirrors and any technology improvements developed under this effort will be directly applied to this market.",  ,,,,Jen  Coniglio,,(585) 265-1020,jconiglio@optimaxsi.com,,  ,

Because geothermal environments can be extremely corrosive, managing the corrosion of alloys used in geothermal system through a combination of proper alloy selection and operational practices is essential. Unfortunately, materials selection and operational guidance for geothermal systems at present are qualitative, and operators work only with lagging indicators of performance. Mineral scaling from geothermal fluids is another major obstacle, fouling devices, wells, and aquifers close to filters, which lowers operating efficiency by decreasing the flow rate from the well and heat transfer efficiency. Scaling also may exacerbate corrosion by acting as a crevice, thereby reducing concentrations of inhibitors that can reach the metal surface. While current models can address aspects of scaling or corrosion, no modeling tool accurately predicts both these problems. OLI Systems proposes an integrated tool to mitigate scaling and corrosion risk in geothermal energy production to lower the cost of geothermal systems. The tool will also be combined with probabilistic assessment and offered as a cloud-based software solution. In Phase 1, the OLI Mixed-Solvent Electrolyte model was refined to model electrochemical kinetics and localized corrosion of alloys and chemistries encountered in geothermal systems. Limited experimental data were used to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, and the model was validated using existing geothermal corrosion data. Mineral scale prediction for some systems is already available in OLI software. In Phase 2, the corrosion model will be further extended using new experimental data to ascertain the performance of alloys at high temperatures. The model will include alloys representing the broadest range of Corrosion Resistant Alloys likely to be used in geothermal applications. The existing OLI Mixed Solvent Electrolyte thermodynamic model will be enhanced to predict the formation of mineral scales from various crystalline and amorphous forms of carbonates, sulfates, silicates, and sulfides over low to extreme ranges of salinity, temperature, and pressure. An advisory module will be created to convert the detailed model predictions into implementation action items/recommendations, including probabilistic assessment. The model will be incorporated into a cloud platform to enable real-time monitoring and process automation. These new capabilities will enable accurate estimation of technical and financial risk for geothermal energy production to make it more cost-competitive, scalable, and reliable than other alternatives. Broader benefits of the project will include the ability to model electrochemical kinetics in non-aqueous environments involved in energy storage and metal separation, as well as material performance in oil and gas production systems.",  ,,,,Andre  Anderko,,(973) 969-2773,aanderko@olisystems.com,,  ,

National facilities are fully equipped with X-ray and neutron scattering beamlines, and many laboratories have their own lab-based X-ray systems. However, no lab-based neutron scattering system currently exist. The challenge has been the creation of a suitably powerful lab-based neutron source, coupled to a compact small angle neutron scattering setup, an efficient detector, and time-of-flight protocol. We propose to design, fabricate, and create a laboratory small angle neutron scattering (LaSANS) instrument, which combines a compact, yet powerful lab-based, Adelphi Technology, Inc. thermal neutron generator with a focusing collimator, an efficient, position-sensitive detector, and using a compact scattering geometry. This first-ever lab-based, small angle neutron scattering system will be designed and fabricated by a former NIST neutron scientist with over 20 years’ experience. We have exceptional resources, including a neutron imaging system, to support the LaSANS instrument testing and development program. The workplan starts with a custom designed focusing collimator and a position-sensitive neutron event detector, and then benchmark experiments with the neutron imaging instrument.

The LaSANS instrument performance will reviewed by at least twenty-nine potential customers. Neutron scattering is a critical component of polymer and pharmacology structure optimization.

Of the different encoding methods, time-bin encoding is both common and advantageous for quantum networks, however, scaling time-bin-based quantum networks poses two key challenges. First, these networks require identical phase-locked delay lines within each networking node to handle the time-encoded quantum information. Increasing time-bin count requires more delays that must also be phase locked throughout the network, increasing complexity. Second, combating low rates arising from fiber losses—even with quantum repeaters—requires higher bandwidths. As laying additional fibers to increase bandwidth is cost prohibitive, spectral multiplexing becomes necessary. This program is developing photonic chip-based time-to-frequency multiplexers to convert time-bin quantum information to frequency-division multiplexed signals within a single time-bin that will be transmitted efficiently through fiber and demultiplexed using a complimentary chip. To achieve time-to- frequency multiplexing, this program is developing photonic chips containing three stages. First, a time- bin combiner uses 1&#215;2 switches and delays to separate and retime the quantum information pulses into one time slot on different physical channels. Next, RF-driven resonators shift the frequency of each channel. Lastly, a series of add/drop filters spectrally combine the channels onto a common bus finishing the time-to-frequency multiplexing. This frequency-stacked quantum information could be further multiplexed using time-division multiplexing on the same chip. In a successful Phase I, this program as demonstrated time-to-frequency multiplexing using a bulk lithium niobate modulator with two-time bins with a frequency shift of ~60 GHz (0.5 nm). To scale this approach to higher time-bin counts, this program has designed, fabricated, and tested key thin-film lithium niobate subcomponents including low-loss waveguides, edge coupler, and ring-resonator based frequency shifters, showing the viability of this approach. Within Phase II, through iterative design, fabrication, and testing cycles, this program will fully develop packaged integrated time-to-frequency multiplexing units, perform measurements at both classical and single-photon light levels, and observe the effect on the quantum state after passing through a multiplexer and demultiplexer within a time-to-frequency multiplexed link. Lastly, this program will increase the number of frequency channels through an iterative design cycle. This Phase II effort will result in a proof- of-concept time-to-frequency multiplexed link to greatly enhance the bandwidth of quantum networks. Time-to-frequency multiplexing technology will enable multiplexing of quantum-entanglement data over current fiber-based networks, greatly increasing the capacity of near-term quantum networks without the burden of laying additional dedicated fiber. This approach will reduce initial quantum-network infrastructure to expedite some of the first quantum networks.

These smaller gaps devices can be subjected to higher heat loads due to increased sensitivity to resistive wall impedances, beam losses, geometric impedance contributions and synchrotron radiation heating. Consequently, short period SCUs should ideally be designed to operate at higher temperatures where the cryo-cooling capacities are larger. Most SCUs developed to date utilize NbTi superconducting wire, which can only be operated at the liquid helium temperatures (&lt; 4.2 K), and thus are very sensitive to the warm core effects. MgB2 is a metallic superconductor with a transition temperature of around 39 K, significantly higher than NbTi or even Nb3Sn. The material also does not suffer from an unstable superconducting state at large currents or fields. Recent progress in the development of the 2nd generation MgB2 with much increased critical current, makes this material a promising new contender for the SCU applications. If one can develop a MgB2 SCU operating at ~12 K, Gifford-McMahon cryocoolers can be used which are less expensive, and offer superior cooling capacity compared to their liquid helium counterparts operating below 4.2 K. Phase I of this project entailed the design, simulation and cryogenic system engineering of the SCU prototype device that will utilize MgB2 wire, along with the construction of a sample wound module to gain familiarity with the manufacturing and validation needs.

This would enable to start implementation and testing of such an SCU locally at one beamline location, without the major upfront cost of developing a facility-wide cryogenic infrastructure and thus well worth the investment.

Large lipid rafts are required as the landing pad for microbes on host cells and for initiation of many inflammatory processes in bronchial epithelial and immune cells. We discovered apoA-I binding protein (AIBP) as a molecule that selectively targets the cholesterol depletion machinery to pathologic lipid rafts in inflammatory cells, without affecting homeostatic cellular function. The latter explains an exceptional safety profile of AIBP in mice and rats. In the Phase I of this grant, using mouse models of asthma, we demonstrated that administration of a biologic derived from the AIBP protein, was effective in an acute HDM model of asthma in mice, reducing airway hyperresponsiveness, airway eosinophilia, and expression of Th2 cytokines and epithelial alarmins. In a model of severe asthma, AIBP significantly reduced pulmonary neutrophilia. For Phase II proposal, a team of experts in biologic drug development and in preclinical assessment and clinical trials of therapeutic agents in asthma has been assembled to further the characterization of an improved AIBP sequence, RFT1124, as a development candidate for severe asthma. Specifically, we plan to manufacture and release RFT1124 drug product for efficacy and toxicology studies using cGMP-compatible processes and analytical assays. The efficacy of RFT1124 as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists (ICS+LABA) will be tested in mouse models of asthma exacerbated by rhinovirus (RV) infection. In addition, we will use precision cut lung slices from asthmatics and non-asthmatics postmortem lung tissue to test the efficacy of add-on RFT1124 in ICS+LABA treatment in RV infected human airways. RNAseq studies will establish whether RFT1124 inhibits corticosteroid insensitive anti-inflammatory pathways and/or enhances corticosteroid sensitive pathways in RV infected human bronchial epithelial cells. Further, a non-GLP safety assessment of intranasal delivery of RFT1124 will be conducted to establish an estimate of safety margin and target organs. These results will be used to prepare for and conduct pre-IND (Type B) meeting with the FDA.",  ,,,,YAKOV  KOGAN,,2165443259,ykogan@raftpharma.com,,  ,

Automotive, defense, and other industries use simulation to bring safer products to market faster. Unfortunately, mainstream simulation software is incompatible with the data structures used for design models. This means the design models must be approximated via a meshing process into a different mathematical format before they can be simulated. Even today’s best methods for problems like simulating automotive crashes require millions of dollars of manual labor to prepare each simulation. And even after all this work, these approximated simulation models take up vast amounts of high-performance computing resources. While simulation has an important role in product development, these inefficiencies limit how much it can actually be used to perfect new designs. The company is introducing radically new, next-generation computer simulation technology that avoids many of these inefficiencies. Its patent-pending approach to isogeometric analysis allows finite element analysis directly on design models, without the approximation step. It allows users to manage the trade-offs between manual and automated pre-processing. An engineer can choose to spend time preparing an exact simulation model and reaping the benefits of faster computation, or can choose a fast, automated model preparation which places a higher computing burden on the computer. Most importantly, and unique to this new technology, is that the engineer can choose any level in between. They can invest varying amounts of manual model preparation time depending on their needs. This will allow unprecedented accuracy and flexibility in computer simulation of new products across many industries. The proposed work in this project will integrate a graphical-processing-unit-optimized library, funded by the Advanced Scientific Computing Research Program, with the company’s isogeometric analysis software to dramatically reduce computation time across the entire spectrum of simulations run with isogeometric analysis. In Phase I, the company collaborated with a national laboratory to add support for spline bases to the library, develop new quadrature schemes, and complete a proof-of-concept integration. The proof of concept was successful and demonstrated significant speed improvements. During Phase II, the company will expand the proof of concept and develop an efficient, fully commercializable, isogeometric analysis solver for general purpose use. Specifically, it will extend the capability of the library to process structured data, complete the integration of the library with its own commercial software, and optimize this software to take full advantage of the library. The ability to run computer simulations on design models without the inefficient meshing step will have benefits for many industries. With isogeometric analysis removing data approximations and delivering more accurate simulation results, these companies can reduce or even eliminate physical prototyping. Better products, more optimally designed, can get to market faster for consumers. Markets that are concerned about consumer safety, such as automotive and defense, will be able to more easily develop new designs because they will no longer have to physically build and crash their products to test them for safety. Designers who are concerned about developing energy-efficient products will be able to design, simulate, and optimize their designs for energy efficiency much more quickly and at less cost.",  ,,,,Mitchell  Hortin,,(801) 717-2296,mitch@coreform.com,,  ,

Significant commercial scale deployment of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies are necessary to achieve the climate change mitigation goal of greatly reducing the global CO2 emissions, while allowing for the utilization of fossil fuels as a transitional power source to continue. There is a diverse portfolio of enabling technologies for global climate change mitigation available for large-scale CO2 emissions reductions and CCS will play a critical role in meeting the international goal of limiting the global warming to 2&#176;C. To achieve this goal, significant investments in new technologies will be required over the next 20 years. Hybrid energy systems combine energy sources, energy storage and carbon capture to provide the potential of greater flexibility and lower costs for various decarbonization scenarios. REI will deliver a novel, cloud-based hybrid energy decision-making software tool for modeling hybrid power systems with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). The software will take advantage of significant investments by DoE in hybrid systems modeling and economic analysis, while allowing non-expert users to evaluate various decarbonization scenarios. The IDAES-based software will be wrapped with a web-based user interface and will be sold using a software-as-a- service (SaaS) model, where users pay for access to the website and corresponding simulation engine. The competitive advantage of our product will be its ease-of-access, ease-of-use, as well as enhanced modeling capabilities that will be phased in by the team. The result will be a cloud- deployed modeling capability that will provide a vital link in the chain to make hybrid energy with CCS achievable at large-scale. The proposed software’s powerful simulation capabilities will be made available to decision-makers that do not have dedicated modeling, simulation and financial experts on staff. The final product will be a computationally efficient, user-friendly hybrid energy decision-making software solution deployed on cloud resources with a web interface using a Software-as-a-Service model. This decision support tool will help enable the widespread use of models and simulations for expansion planning to inform future investments for decarbonization. The software will evaluate the technical and financial feasibility of hybrid power systems that enables users to assess a range of technologies. The availability of this software will help to develop stakeholder confidence in hybrid energy systems with CCS by evaluating technical details, logistics, and costs. The software is expected to be of interest to the numerous stakeholders involved in hybrid energy and CCS projects, including power utilities, investors, landowners, DoE and regulatory entities and capital investors.",  ,,,,David  Swensen,,(801) 364-6925,swensen@reaction-eng.com,,  ,

The performance of any optical manufacturing process directly depends on the ability of its integrated optical surface metrology method to provide trustworthy feedback. High-accuracy metrology is vitally essential in manufacturing ultra-high-quality free-form mirrors designed to manipulate X-ray light with nanometer-scale wavelengths. Due to the shorter wavelength, requirements for the surface figure and finish of X-ray mirrors are three orders of magnitude more stringent than for visible-light optics. Correspondingly, the metrology integrated into X-ray mirror manufacturing must ensure the accuracy of optical surface fabrication on the sub-nanometer level. Improvements are needed not only for the classical plane, spherical, and sagittal cylindrical X-ray mirrors but, even more urgently, for free-form aspherical X-ray mirrors with moderately and strongly curved shapes, such as paraboloids, ellipsoids, hyperbolas, diaboloids, etc. The availability of such mirrors on the market will directly advance the fundamental and applied research performed at the DOE X-ray light facilities. As an adage say, if you can't measure it, you cannot make it. Any image/data is as good as how well the metrology tool is calibrated and performing. Metrology data serves as the feedback function for the manufacturing process. Our technology is based on thorough characterization of the metrology tool for both the resolution limit and lens distortion using the specially designed test artifact and data processing software. Once the performance limitation is quantitatively characterized, data processing is applied to correct the images, as if the images were taken under an idealized system. These data will be stitched together with high accuracy to characterize the full meter-scale aspherical x-ray mirrors. This would substantially improve the existing stitching interferometry with limited accuracy. Metrology is used in virtually every industry where the manufacturers need to measure the surface roughness for quality assurance (e.g., mirrors, car parts, and foods). The world's top companies highly value our results, requesting the test samples and software immediately after they become commercially available. The solution will improve reliability, exclude the &quot;human factor,&quot; and simplify and expedite the calibration.",  ,,,,Keiko  Munechika,,(360) 402-4112,km@highrioptics.com,,  ,

To support these experiments, the DOE currently supports numerous neutron facilities in the US. Needless to state, the future experiments will demand a much higher neutron radiation flux than what is currently available for the scattering experiments. This demand can be met by preserving the neutron brilliance within the existing neutron optical systems. This is accomplished via the application of “Supermirror” coatings. However, there is no US manufacturer that can address this need nor is there a coating technology that can apply these coatings on 3D neutron optics. RMD will address this challenge by deploying Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) technique to grow the desired neutron supermirrors on complex 3D neutron optics and planar neutron guides. This will overcome the traditional problems associated with Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) methods. The key advantage of the proposed ALD technique is that it facilitates conformal growth of supermirrors with an excellent control on thickness and easy scalability. In Phase I, RMD demonstrated the technical feasibility to grow the Zr/Ti-based neutron supermirrors by ALD on polished substrates and in non-planar substrates such as micro-capillary arrays with aspect ratio &gt; 10:1. In Phase II, RMD will scale up the ALD process to produce neutron supermirror coatings on large substrates measuring 18”x6” in dimensions. Some of the non-planar substrates that will be targeted for the coatings will be parabolic, elliptic and Wolter optics. Specifically, RMD will aim for supermirrors with m&gt;4 performance metric while developing ALD processes for Ni/Ti based coatings. The proposed development of supermirror coatings by ALD will allow the scheduled neutron flux upgrades at Spallation Neutron Source and Second Target Source at ORNL. Recently, more complex shapes with different geometries (tapered, elliptic, and parabolic) have been considered for neutron guides. These can be realized with the proposed ALD supermirrors, which provides the desired conformal coatings over 3D objects. This will also reduce the cost significantly because the need for the straight neutron guides is completely eliminated with elliptic mirrors in ballistic guides over long distances. The proposed supermirror coatings also apply to X-Ray and other extreme UV applications.",  ,,,,Harish  Bhandari,,(617) 668-6922,hbhandari@rmdinc.com,,  ,

These detectors employ thousands of readout channels working at increasingly high event rate. If based on off-the-shelf components, the electronics occupy large volume, dissipate excessive heat and cannot tolerate high TID levels. Pacific Microchip Corp. proposes to develop a TID tolerant ASIC to support high-speed streaming readout for segmented detectors. The ASIC includes a continuously sampling 32-channel 12-bit 1GS/s ADC IP block, a high-performance DSP block and an event building back-end. In addition, the ASIC can capture and stream out the event related waveform samples (including the pre- and post-event). The ADC will digitize while the DSP block will shape the event related pulses, restore the baseline, detect the pulse peak, analyze its amplitude, timing, add the channel address information, compress the data and ship it out to the PCB. This ASIC will facilitate the detector systems to support streaming readout while simultaneously increasing the readout speed, TID tolerance, cost effectiveness, robustness and will lower power consumption. In Phase I, the ASIC’s architecture was developed, the TID immunity of the ADC IP block was tested, the critical circuits were designed, and the proof of feasibility was provided. Phase II will result in the fabricated and tested ASIC’s prototype. In addition to such instruments as “pECal” (forward electromagnetic calorimeter in the proton/ion going direction) for the EPIC detector, the ASIC can find application in radiography instruments in medicine, imaging systems for airport security, border/customs control, industrial radiography systems for non- destructive defect detection. Currently, there is no TID tolerant ASIC that can perform the DSP function simultaneously in 32 channels on event produced pulses digitized at 1GS/s. The ASIC will be provided as a component, and as an IP block. According to “Allied Market Research”, the global sensor technology market is growing annually at a CAGR of 8.9% and is expected to reach $345.77B by 2028. The ASIC can also be used as a multichannel ADC. According to the ADC market analysis provided by Reports and Data, “The Analog-To-Digital Converters market is projected to grow at a rate of 4.9% in terms of value, from USD 2.66 Billion in 2020 to reach USD 3.88 Billion by 2028”.

Many facilities currently use photocathode materials with excitation by high power ultraviolet pulses, which places extreme demands on system components. Therefore, photocathode materials operating in the visible spectrum are being developed. One impediment to a systematic characterization of these materials is the lack of a suitable high-power excitation laser that is tunable across a wide range with high performance. We propose a laser-driven optical parametric amplification system, which will provide tunable 10’s of picosecond pulses in the visible spectrum at high energy and high repetition rate. Our system emphasizes efficiency in the tunable laser system design to scale to high average power. In Phase I, we demonstrated the feasibility of our proposed technique for the generation of tunable visible pulses for photocathode characterization. We built a prototype novel nonlinear fiber- amplifier seed source and constructed an optical parametric amplifier followed by conversion to tunable visible pulses, at 200kHz repetition rate. Experiments were guided by a numerical model. In Phase II, we will scale our tunable laser system to high average power. We will build a fiber amplifier and parametric amplifier operating at 1 MHz repetition rate, ultimately outputting tunable microjoule pulses of tens of picoseconds duration. Extended numerical models will guide and optimize system performance. Our proposed instrument will provide a valuable tool that can ultimately enable next generation electron accelerator user facilities to operate on a smaller footprint, be built at lower cost, and enhance availability, therefore increasing applications in the medical, research, and security sectors.

The challenge we address is creating a user- friendly automated geospatial decision support software to help site this infrastructure. We will develop the Negative CO2 Emission Transition Roadmap (NECTAR), novel software for siting DAC Infrastructure that uses the IDAES framework. Once developed NECTAR will, for the first time and on the scale and speed demanded by the industry and climate, use IDAES to estimate the cost and performance of DAC powered by various sources of carbon neutral energy, while also providing assistance with community acceptance. We: 1) developed a NECTAR minimum viable product; 2) used process-level and systems-level modeling to determine the geospatial cost of DAC across the country; 3) optimized regional CO2 transportation pipe- line networks; 4) conducted dozens of market research interviews to demonstrate NECTAR and gain feed- back. We disseminated these research activities with multiple peer-reviewed and open-source journal publications and a conference presentation. We will use IDAES to model multiple hybrid energy systems of DAC coupled with multiple options for carbon neutral heat. We will quantify the environmental impact (e.g., carbon footprint) and cost of each DAC hybrid energy system. We will develop a nationwide database of inputs (e.g., cost of primary energy) so that NECTAR can be run across the country. We will develop cloud-based software for NECTAR that integrates front-end and back-end code and algorithms that can be demonstrated.

Most existing simulation co des require training and expertise and have restrictive licenses that make them hard to acquire and use. One promising open-source code is easy to use and can spread its calculations across many computers, but it lacks the biasing methods essential for rapid evaluation of radiation transport. An existing simulation code will be modified so that—using a minimal amount of computer power—it can precisely evaluate how much radiation travels through matter. A graphical interface will make the code easier to use and will provide a way for researchers to execute their simulations using cloud computing resources, with simulation results presented in the same interface. A weight window method was implemented to bias neutron transport so that the flux can be evaluated globally within a model, even far away from the neutron source. This is implemented with a few simple rules that, for example, drop the neutrons most likely to get stopped within shielding. A prototype browser-based interface was also created that generates interactive visualizations of the initial model and also plots simulation results. The prototype interface will be extended, based on expert feedback, so that it is ready for use in industrial R&amp;D. We will also implement a state-of-the-art biasing method that uses an analytic approach, which will be more efficient for simulating complex systems. Finally, we will generalize the way users can define their model geometries, including allowing them to use existing digital engineering models, instead of translating their models into a specific syntax. A fully-featured, browser-based interface for radiation transport simulations—including new biasing methods—will speed up the R&amp;D phase for fusion reactor design and the validation of small modular fission reactors. Businesses will subscribe to our software to save time and money when evaluating the radiation-related impacts of frequent design changes.",  ,,,,Stephen  Coleman,,(720) 502-3928,coleman@radiasoft.net,,  ,

However, a significant hurdle for achieving the full potential of cryo-EM, including work performed at facilities associated with DOE, involves difficulties with sample preparation. Reliably producing vitrified ultrathin samples on grids, especially those associated with single particle analysis (SPA), is very challenging. Too often, grids delivered to these facilities are found inadequate for collecting good data, and the investigator’s precious user time on microscopes is wasted. This project is addressing these difficulties by developing a novel tool to rapidly screen cryo-EM grids at point- of-origin by providing critical information on the thickness of the vitreous ice/sample layer. In addition to identifying the best sample grids for further cryo-EM analysis, this information can enable near real-time optimization of vitrification procedures to increase sample preparation workflow. The technology being developed could be used in either standalone instruments or incorporated into full robotic vitrification systems. A prototype instrument was designed and constructed to validate our approach for rapid and precise screening of cryo-EM sample grids. Its initial performance was demonstrated by imaging test grids at cryogenic temperature. Lateral spatial resolution was observed to be in the target range below 1?m. Several different embodiments of the tool were evaluated for incorporation with the more sophisticated Phase II prototype instrument. IP protection for this technology was started, and strategic relationships for Phase II were set up. Significant improvements to the instrument and its performance will be developed and incorporated into the prototype. This instrument will be used in conjunction with work at the Stanford-SLAC Cryo-EM Center to validate its utility in a real research environment. Efforts to commercialize this technology will be pursued. Cryo-EM has experienced explosive growth in recent years, with projected worldwide annual revenue for just microscopes to exceed $1B before 2030. Improved sample preparation equipment represents a substantial percentage of this market sector. Cryo-EM data has become central for many areas of basic and applied science, including drug discovery in the huge biotech and pharma industries. This project seeks to develop a crucial tool for greatly improving the workflow for cryo-EM analysis in many disciplines of life sciences, medicine, environmental research, and other fields requiring structure determination at the highest possible resolution.",  ,,,,Gregory  Hirsch,,(650) 219-7736,graviton99@gmail.com,,  ,

The major challenge in harnessing GPU systems for such algebraic solvers is simultaneously using all hardware resources via an optimized MPI environment, specifically instruction scheduling (i.e., kernel launches), computation, and communication. Achieving this requires MPI support for streams, efficient non-contiguous memory access, nearest neighbor collectives, communication reduction methods such as message coalescing and on-the-fly compression, and GPU-efficient non-blocking global reductions. We will design and develop SMART-PETSc: a Smart Middleware for Accelerating PETSc on modern high-performance computing hardware. We will work along the following directions: 1) develop optimized methods to overlap kernel launch and execution time to improve parallel hardware utilization, 2) co-design PETSc and MVAPICH using the MPI-T inter- face to support user-specified GPU streams, 3) support in-network communication for non-blocking and neighborhood CPU-/GPU-based collectives, 4) apply on-the-fly compression methods to reduce communication overheads, 5) improve network bandwidth via GPU-aware message coalescing designs 6) enable full-stack observability/explainability through integration with the TAU Performance System via the MPI-T interface, and 7) measure the impact of proposed designs on PETSc end applications. We demonstrated the feasibility of the SMART-PETSc product by implementing optimized datatype processing techniques, intelligent protocol selection and integration with the MPI-T Interface and TAU performance system, and optimized neighborhood collectives. The initial prototype can run successfully on 30 nodes with up to 1,000 MPI processes with the PETSc application. Initial customer engagements with the prototype product have taken place. We aim to build on top of the success of Phase-I to build the complete SMART-PETSc product while primarily focusing on the major technical goals, in-depth Q&amp;A testing, and commercialization. The transformative impact of the proposed SMART- PETSc product will enable many HPC and DL frameworks/applications that use PETSc routines to take advantage of the novel features and capabilities on emerging hardware technologies and reap the additive benefits of co-design and tighter integration between PETSc and MVAPICH libraries. We expect that the solutions SMART-PETSc will provide can reduce the communication overhead by up to 6x. This leads to a significant boost in performance and scalability of many HPC and DL frame- works/ applications that use PETSc APIs. The proposed collaboration will enable DOE Labs to use the SMART-PETSc middleware on upcoming exascale systems and provide a commercial version for use by supercomputing centers and cloud providers worldwide.",  ,,,,Donglai  Dai,,(614) 316-4209,d.dai@x-scalesolutions.com,,  ,

The challenge is to find innovative technologies and sustainable alternatives that preserve the range of materials and products currently derived from petroleum while limiting the deleterious effects of anthropogenic climate change, associated with its use. One promising technology is to utilize the abundant, inexpensive lignocellulosic feedstocks and its conversion to a series of biological and catalytic procedures into high-value chemicals used in the polymer, plastics, and transportation industries. During Phase I of this grant, Visolis demonstrated the feasibility of a hybrid bio-thermocatalytic process using engineered microbes to convert cellulosic C5/C6 sugars arising from a wide variety of lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks into high value bioproducts for the plastics and polymers industries. Visolis has already developed catalytic processes to convert the platform molecule into various chemicals that are of high value to the plastics, and transportation industries. Visolis have demonstrated in establishing the feasibility of the proposed process and haver shown results as a proof of our concept in Phase I and have identified specific bottlenecks, which are addressed in the Phase II. The overall objective in Phase II is to demonstrate monomer production from cellulosic feedstocks via mevalonate as an intermediate by scaling up the proposed process to pilot scale and to fine-tune the processes integration for running a commercial-scale plant. The key technology developed under the Phase II is to utilize the abundant lignocellulosic biomass feedstocks and produce a sustainable green alternative to the traditional petrochemical-based processes at a cost-competitive price, without any food security concerns, into plastics, polymers, and fuel additives. During Phase II of this project, we will further optimize our production strains and fermentation parameters in order to increase product titers and yields as well as integrate and scale up our process into a pilot plant while preserving the performance metrics. Phase II will also target for high volume of mevalonolactone production in 20L bioreactors, so that high volume of mevalonate and products can be produced in the pilot scale to significantly de-risk commercializing the process. Key to the success of the commercialization effort will be the successful completion of Phase II, meeting all the yield and quality targets, and securing partners, ideally one of the end-users of our products. The successful prototyping of our process at pilot scale will enable us to attract partners and investors to bring this technology to market. Upon full development, our process will produce a portfolio of high-value renewable chemicals, with several economic advantages, including lower feedstock cost, greater feedstock flexibility, inexpensive product synthesis/separation and in the displacement of fossil fuels.",  ,,,,Deepak  Dugar,,(617) 955-4626,dugar@visolisbio.com,,  ,

Thus, resolving interactions and tracking metabolic processes within living systems requires multi-scale imaging to visualize cells at the community, cellular, subcellular, and single-molecule scales. Although techniques like light sheet fluorescence microscopy can achieve this multi-scale imaging, light sheets illuminate only one side of samples, resulting in shadowing artifacts that can obscure the field of view and prevent proper interpretation of the larger system. This Phase II SBIR/STTR project will develop a novel parabolic mirror-based imaging system that is compatible with existing inverted microscopes and that eliminates shadowing across scales—at both high and low resolution—to enable accurate interpretation of any specimen. The project objectives are to build a second-generation prototype and test its performance on a range of samples, to initiate alpha testing with collaborators, and to investigate the use with structured illumination with this system to allow for super-resolution imaging. The ability to visualize microbial communities without shadowing at both low magnification and super-resolution will open up new experimental space for investigating the complex energetic relationships in microbial systems. Furthermore, in the long term, the radical design change made possible by this technology will provide a platform for further innovation, enabling the development of completely new imaging techniques and expanding what is currently possible in the field of live-cell fluorescence microscopy.",  ,,,,Joel  Smith,,(626) 379-6659,jsmith@mizarimaging.com,The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,  ,

In Phase I, Particle Flux Analytics matured a highly capable small, automated weather sensor aimed at solving these challenges. The SnowPixel is a pixelated 24&#215;24 micro-hotplate array that provides a video “heat map” of environmental cooling signatures. In Phase I, the SnowPixel was designed to be capable of automated adaptive sampling of both winds and hydrometeor evaporation. In laboratory and field testing, and with new algorithms for signal analysis, it was shown how the SnowPixel can yield coincident statistics for the mass of individual snow and rain particles, the bulk precipitation rate, and wind speed. The device was successfully deployed to a high-alphine site in Utah and Gothic, CO as part of the ASR SAIL Campaign. In Phase II, Particle Flux Analytics aims to bring to market a disruptive beta-prototype Snow- Pixel device, introducing sophisticated, small, automated, weather stations for the scientific re- search and transportation safety sectors.

While random arrangements of NV centers can work in these applications, having more precise placement of NV centers in arrays and at more uniform depths from the surface help improve the sensitivity and resolution of these applications. Our approach is to employ state-of-the-art diamond crystal growth technology to create high quality diamond with nitrogen (N) placed in a plane located precisely near the surface and co-dopants also introduced for Fermi level control to maximize NV-population, followed by multiphoton femtosecond laser writing to create NV centers which are precisely placed in two-dimensional arrays in that same plane. This approach can be applied in principle to any crystallographic orientation of diamond.

Hospital patients who acquire nosocomial IFIs experience longer hospital stays, increased morbidity, and higher mortality rates. Only a few classes of antifungal drugs are available, and the emergence of resistance within all classes is an alarming threat to global public health. Of particular concern are infections caused by Candida, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Pneumocystis species due the level of resistance seen with these pathogens and the associated mortality rates. New classes of anti-fungals are desperately needed, particularly with the emergence of multidrug resistant strains. To address this need, Curatix is developing a new class of anti-fungals that disrupt an essential metabolic pathway and first step in coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis - the phosphorylation of vitamin B5 by pantothenate kinase (PanK). Genetic and pharmacological studies demonstrated that in fungi, this step is essential for cell viability, thus validating fungal PanKs as excellent targets for the development of new classes of antifungal drugs. To achieve this goal, we conducted high-throughput screen of ~156,593 compounds to search for inhibitors of A. fumigatus AfPanK and identified three 1st generation compounds within a single chemotype with Ki values ranging between 190 and 360 nM. Screening and preliminary medicinal chemistry optimization of 86 analogs identified four 2nd generation compounds with improved activity against AfPanK as well as S. cerevisiae PanK (Cab1) with Ki values ranging between 12 and 170 nM for Cab1 and 50 and 217 nM for AfPanK. The compounds showed no cytotoxicity against five human cell lines, very high selectivity for fungal PanKs over human PanKs (EC50 >10 µM), and significant biological activity in vitro against C. albicans, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata. We further solved the crystal structure of Cab1 as an apo-enzyme and in complex with these inhibitors. This Phase I program will build upon these significant data with the goal to evaluate the biological activity of these lead compounds in vivo and initiate an SAR to improve their antifungal potency (>10 fold). In Aim 1 we will characterize the in vivo efficacy of these compounds in animal models of candidiasis and aspergillosis. In Aim 2, we will build upon the biological, biochemical and structural data to generate a library of analogs in order to identify compounds with more potent activity against multiple fungal pathogens. Successful completion of the Phase I program will provide the critical data needed to support a Phase II program focused on the efficacy of the lead compounds in various models of fungal infections alone or in combination with other known antifungals. Clinical use of a PanK inhibitor has the potential to provide a more effective therapeutic option for treating IFIs, both as monotherapy and in combination with existing drugs, thus greatly decreasing the economic and healthcare burdens associated with these infections and improving patient outcomes.",  ,,,,JAEYEON  CHOI,,8609067302,choukri.benmamoun@yale.edu,,  ,

As a consequence, 64B is well-tolerated for prolonged periods in tumor bearing mice, both alone and in combination with multiple other cancer therapeutics.  We’ve published studies where several UM cell lines were orthotopically implanted within the uveal of the eye, showing that 64B inhibits primary tumor growth and metastases in mice while also prolonging survival. Results from our Phase I SBIR studies built on this prior work and strongly support the continued development of 64B as an important, novel and innovative cancer therapeutic. 64B demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy when compared to two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs, sunitinib and selumetinib) that are in phase 2 or 3 clinical testing for UM. 64B was better tolerated that the TKIs. When tumors were much larger when treatment was started, 64B showed therapeutic synergy when combined with sorafenib, another TKI in clinical testing for UM.  Our Phase I SBIR studies led to significant progress in the chemistry needed to advance 64B into clinical testing. A 5-step synthesis was selected that eliminated the use of microwave reactors, chromatographic purifications and use of palladium catalysts. The overall production yield was improved from about 2 % to >22%, or about 75% yield per stage across the five stages. Through refinement of the process, 700 g of 64B were produced with >98 % purity, providing sufficient 64B for proposed SBIR phase 2 studies. We tested amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) as an enhanced formulation method that improved 64B’s solubility more than 40-fold. Metabolic and PK studies provided evidence the plasma levels of orally delivered 64B were insufficient to fully block HIF, most likely due to first pass effects in the liver, and thus we will focus on parenteral delivery for preclinical and clinical studies.  Phase II SBIR studies will identify the best 64B-TKI class combination to advance for clinical testing using UM cells directly implanted in the uvea of the eye. Studies on responsiveness to 64B using several UM cell lines with targeted deletion of HIF-1a, HIF-2a or both will add additional mechanistic insights. Other objectives are focused on converting to IV dosing for both efficacy and non-GLP toxicology studies, including determining the maximum tolerated dose of 64B and repeat dosing toxicity in two species. We anticipate successful completion of all specific aims within 2 years and securing the additional funds needed for completing IND-enabling studies, filing an IND, and launching clinical testing using 64B with a TKI for metastatic UM.",  ,,,,MARGARET K OFFERMANN,,7709055369,offermann@oncospherix.com,,  ,

Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) occurs in both age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic
retinopathy (DR). While anti-VEGF treatment has improved the visual outcome considerably, they are far from
achieving a 100% success rate (non-responsiveness between 8 and 50%). Inherited retinal degenerations
(IRDs) are a group of heterogeneous, progressive, visually debilitating diseases that can lead to blindness and
the few current approved treatments have limited efficacy. An alternative treatment option, a drug with a
therapeutic mechanism different from VEGF suppression and gene augmentation therapy, would be helpful as
an adjunct or alternative to existing therapies to suppress CNV and treatment for IRDs. It is well known that
many retinal degenerations are associated with protein misfolding. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are
used in therapy for protein misfolding diseases in cancer. They also attenuate CNV and exhibit neuroprotection
for IRDs. Butyric acid is a potent, endogenous HDACi. Variations of butyric acid, specifically 4-phenylbutyric
acid (4-PBA), have been touted as potential therapeutic interventions in IRDs. However, the clinical translation
of butyric acid and its forms is limited due to its relatively short half-life. An effective strategy to overcome the
limitations of ophthalmic therapeutics butyric acid is to synthesize their pro-drugs, a self-assembling butyrate
nanoparticle (BNP). BNPs are smaller, uniform, and stable at various pH levels and under refrigerated storage
conditions. This proposal focuses on evaluating the safety and therapeutic efficacy of BNPs in the prevention
of choroidal neovascularization and retinal protection. For Aim 1, we will test the effectiveness of BNP in
preventing choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a well-characterized laser-induced model of CNV. For Aim 2,
we will evaluate the therapeutic efficiency of BNP in a well-characterized genetic model of retinal degeneration.
We will perform functional, structural, histological, biochemical, and molecular analyses to evaluate the efficacy

One of the most common and devastating sequelae of uncontrolled DM is the development of chronic non-healing wounds. An estimated 25% of diabetic patients develop chronic non-healing ulcers in their lifetime that, given the poor vascularity and immunodeficiency associated with diabetes, are highly susceptible to infection and frequently result in limb amputation. DM is currently the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. Current management primarily focuses on controlling wound bioburden to promote wound healing, which includes pressure off-loading, antimicrobial medications and dressings, judicious wound care, and optimization of lifestyle factors. However, complete wound closure is complicated by impairment of cellular migration and function in DM wounds. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop novel therapeutic methods for diabetic wounds that directly restore the molecular and cellular processes required to promote proper cutaneous repair.  Injuries in diabetic patients often persist and progress. Chronic DM causes significant alterations to several physiologic wound healing mechanisms that impair timely cell infiltration/migration, granulation tissue formation, and wound contraction. Based on more than 20 years of research on wound healing management, we have developed a technologically innovative fibromodulin (FMOD)-based amino acid peptide sequence, SLI-F06, that markedly stimulates fibroblast and endothelial cell migration and myofibroblast differentiation/contraction to promote timely wound closure. Previously, we demonstrated that SLI-F06 significantly promotes acute wound healing without eliciting any adverse effects in preclinical animal studies at maximal feasible dosing as well as in ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial targeting acute wound healing. Excitingly, we have shown that repeated SLI- F06 administration significantly accelerates diabetic wound closure in a mouse model (NONcNZO10/LtJ) that closely simulates human type 2 DM. The goal of the current Fast-track SBIR application is to obtain the key preclinical efficacy and mechanism of action data for SLI-F06 as a repeatedly administered, locally applied therapeutic for diabetic wounds for expanding the clinical indication of SLI-F06. Overall, this proposal will accomplish key efficacy and mechanism of action (MOA) objectives to expedite commercialization of SLI-F06-based therapy for diabetic wounds. This product can significantly improve the quality of life of diabetic patients suffering from chronic wounds that can lead to amputations and death.",  ,,,,ZHONG  ZHENG,,3234966649,leozz95@gmail.com,,  ,

The infection is transmitted by an insect vector that is native to Latin America, but can also be acquired through blood transfusion, organ transplant, or congenitally. Following a brief acute phase, the parasite persists for years in infected carriers, often asymptomatically, but can cause cardiomyopathy and other pathological conditions leading to severe morbidity and mortality. In the U.S., T. cruzi is prevalent in Latin American immigrant populations, where it poses an underrecognized health risk. The gradual encroachment of the insect vector into the southernmost regions of the U.S. has also raised the threat of autochthonous transmission. Chagas disease is challenging to diagnose due to the combination of genotypic and hence antigenic variation across its geographical range, complex immunological interactions with the human host, and cross-reactivities with other parasites. Serology has become the mainstay for diagnosis, especially for chronic infection, but the above challenges have hampered the accuracy of serologic tests such that multiple assays are commonly used in a triangulation algorithm to establish final results. The majority of those at risk for T. cruzi infection live in low-resource, underdeveloped areas where contact with the vector insects is hard to avoid, but medical care is relatively primitive and laboratory infrastructure is absent. For these reasons, rapid, point-of-care tests have become increasingly desirable as tools for diagnosis and epidemiological surveillance of Chagas disease. However, the current generation of Chagas rapid tests is limited by suboptimal performance, both in sensitivity and specificity, largely due to the reliance on recombinant antigens which are specific to certain T. cruzi lineages and often fail to detect Mexican and Central American Chagas cases. To date, only one Chagas rapid test has been cleared by FDA. We propose to complete development of a rapid test for Chagas disease, based on a native protein antigen from cultured T. cruzi termed TESA (Trypanosomal Excreted/Secreted Antigens). We have developed procedures to produce with high yield, enrich and concentrate the antigenic component of TESA, making it suitable for use in a lateral flow assay. In Phase I studies, the prototype TESA rapid test has shown clinical sensitivity and specificity approaching 100% across a range of samples from diverse regions spanning the endemic geography of Latin America, including Mexico and Central America. In Phase II, we will complete development of the TESA lateral flow rapid test in a cost-effective format suitable for point-of-care use in low-resource settings. The clinical and analytical performance of the test will be evaluated in a clinical study involving over 1,000 Chagas patients and controls to be carried out at sites in the U.S. and in an endemic region in Latin America. The clinical study results will support a 510(k) submission to FDA for clearance of the TESA lateral flow rapid test for in vitro diagnosis of Chagas disease.",  ,,,,ANDREW E LEVIN,,6178340950,alevin@kephera.com,,  ,

The primary innovation combines mechanical and chemical storage technologies so that the resultant technology adapts the best features to provide enhanced performance at a cheaper capital, operational, and maintenance cost. The hybrid mechanical and chemical system proposed here uses supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) as the mechanical storage component, while chemical storage is achieved using natural gas or hydrogen.

Yet it is the 6th most  common and deadliest cancer in the world. According to the Oral Cancer Foundation, over 90% of all oral cancers are oral  squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) - a common subset of head and neck cancers. OC claims the life of one American every  hour of each day. Additionally, it is on the rise due to the increasing prevalence of oral human papilloma virus (HPV).  Overall, OC has a 60% survival rate after 5-year remission target, with recurrence being an important prognostic factor.  Data shows a high correlation between OC risks and low socioeconomic, as well as risk factors related to lifestyle. Even in  the clinical settings of industrialized nations, such as the United States (US), many patients receive suboptimal care for  OSCC due to limited resources. Although targeted agents (i.e., tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and immunotherapy (i.e.,  checkpoint inhibitors) have shown promise in multiple solid tumor types, their applicability in the setting of advanced OSCC  remains questionable. Unpredictable side effects, complications, and (especially) high cost limit their US use in low resource  settings and in low/mid-income countries (LMICs). Survival in patients with advanced OSCC is driven primarily by  locoregional treatment failure/recurrence (i.e., primary site or cervical nodal basins). Escalation of conventional treatment  regimens, such as surgery, radiation, and systemic chemotherapy is not feasible due to dose-limiting toxicities. As a result  of these converging factors, there is a need for novel treatments that can augment existing modalities, while improving  locoregional control without toxicities. To address this need, Privo has developed the PRV211 intraoperative product (PRV211), a nano-engineered hydrogel that, immediately after tumor resection or debulking, can be applied directly onto  the tumor bed. PRV211, retains high concentration of immuno/chemotherapy nanoparticles, locally in tumor bed and  regional lymph nodes to treat the locoregional disease and reduce tumor recurrence.",  ,,,,MANIJEH N GOLDBERG,,9786091465,mgoldberg@privotechnologies.com,,  ,

An estimated 24 million undiagnosed or untreated people with OSA (obstructive sleep apnea) contribute to a
$150B economic burden in the US. Most people with OSA are prescribed continuous positive airway pressure
(CPAP) as a first line treatment, but CPAP has a 50% failure rate. Highly effective treatments that target the
anatomic causes of OSA are available but are only effective when the anatomical source of apnea is
appropriately identified. Currently there is no accessible diagnostic that can query airway anatomy during natural
sleep. Increasingly, sleep surgeons use Drug-Induced Sleep Endoscopy (DISE) to investigate the upper airway
anatomy for OSA surgical planning. This diagnostic is subjective, a drain on surgeon time and operating room
resources, inconvenient for patients, and cannot be performed during natural sleep. Several methods have been
investigated to identify obstruction sites during natural sleep, such as using MRI to image the airway of sleeping
patients or introducing a thin tube with multiple pressure sensors into the upper airway. However, these methods
are cost prohibitive, impractical for clinical use, or not tolerated by every patient. Bairitone Health proposes to
develop a platform for the anatomic diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The technology detects
tissue-borne sounds, recognizes their association with normal breathing or airway obstruction, and
identifies the location in the upper airway they emanate from. The overall goal of this Phase I project is to
demonstrate that Bairitone Health’s approach for localization of airway obstructions is technically feasible and
can be developed into a clinical application. To accomplish this goal, Bairitone Health has four specific aims: 1)
develop and train an algorithm to recognize post-apnea snore events indicative of airway reopening, 2) develop
speech-based calibration and airway-obstruction localization methods, 3) optimize the localization method on a
3D-printed human head model by generating sounds at specific locations within the model's airway, and 4)
develop an updated prototype of the sound recording device and sensor configuration. If successful, the platform
will allow the diagnosis of OSA and determination of its anatomical source in one single procedure, streamlining
the process and cutting costs. Completing these aims will validate the technical feasibility of the platform and
usher the technology towards commercial application. Moving the anatomy assessment from the operating room
to the home will result in higher OSA diagnostic capacity. In the future, Bairitone Health plans to integrate
traditional diagnostics collected in current home sleep tests into the home-based anatomy assessment. With the
anatomy information the diagnostic platform can provide, this product will become the first-choice testing tool for
obstructive sleep apnea diagnosis and personalized treatment planning.",  ,,,,ONUR  KILIC,,(650) 714-2938,okilic.stanford@gmail.com,,  ,

distinct sequences which can reliably self-assemble into the desired construct in a single step, and traditional
assembly reactions are typically limited in scale to tens or hundreds of oligonucleotides. Current parallel
synthesis technologies can generate pools of over 1 million oligonucleotides, which is entirely inadequate for a
genome-scale construction, yet far more complex than can be reliably assembled in a single reaction. Despite
substantial interest in improving oligonucleotide synthesis throughput, such technologies cannot be leveraged
fully without accompanying means of guiding their assembly.

proposed studies work to translate this advance (up to 100× enhancement) to the throughput of gene assembly.

scalability mismatch between oligonucleotide synthesis and assembly, enabling a new generation of gene

Schistosomiasis is a debilitating parasitic disease that infects over 230 million people and causes 280,000 deaths per year.
New estimates of global disease burden rank schistosomiasis as the third most impactful infectious disease behind only
HIV/AIDS and malaria. Therefore, over the past decade, global health organizations have renewed interest in
schistosomiasis control and elimination. Efforts to reduce schistosomiasis-associated morbidities primarily involve mass
drug administration (MDA) and measures for interrupting transmission (e.g., via improved access to safe water and snail
(vector) control). Critical to both disease control strategies is the ability to detect infected individuals; however, because
highly endemic areas often lack basic laboratory infrastructure, it is vital that monitoring be performed in the field or at the
point-of-care (POC) to address the vast numbers of sites and individuals needing testing.
Current disease monitoring largely depends upon microscopy techniques to identify/quantify eggs that are sporadically shed
by adult worms in stool or urine. While highly specific, microscopy methods are laborious, time-consuming, inconsistent,
and often have clinical sensitivities under 5%. Alternatives to microscopy include immunoassays that detect schistosome-
specific antigens, such as the circulating cathodic antigen (CCA), or the circulating anodic antigen (CAA), from human
urine. A POC CCA urine assay has been commercialized and used in surveillance and mapping studies, but is not sensitive
enough to detect low-intensity infections, and is only reliably produced by one of the six common Schistosoma species,
which limits its use to certain regions. In contrast, CAA is produced by all Schistosoma species and, unlike microscopy, is
directly correlated to total worm burden for monitoring therapy response. Therefore, a CAA immunoassay is expected to
significantly enhance diagnostic monitoring of schistosomiasis, but no commercially available POC-CAA assay exists.
To address this unmet need, we will integrate two complementary technologies that enable ultra-sensitive POC field-testing
for schistosomiasis from urine. Our collaborator, Dr. Paul Corstjens, a globally recognized schistosomiasis expert at Leiden
University Medical Center, has developed an ultrasensitive Up-Converting Phosphor Lateral Flow Assay (UCP-LFA) for
CAA detection. The assay has shown tremendous promise in several studies and clinical trials but still requires time-
consuming and resource-intensive sample pre-concentration to reach the sensitivity required to detect the lowest-intensity
infections. In parallel, Salus Discovery has developed a new technology, termed FLOW™, that expands upon the
operational concepts of LFAs by enabling pre-concentration of analytes from 20 mL of urine into 100 µL prior to detection
on an LFA. Recently, Salus and Dr. Corstjens' group developed the first prototype of a device that integrates FLOW urine
pre-concentration with a UCP-LFA readout (FLOW-S). The FLOW-S prototype was preliminarily evaluated with a set of
30 clinical samples where it achieved 79% sensitivity and 100% specificity, demonstrating its use as a fundamentally new,
POC-friendly, ultra-sensitive CAA-based assay for schistosomiasis. In this SBIR Phase 1 proposal we will build upon our

Bioengineered microbes are a promising strategy to develop live biotherapeutic products that can
introduce novel metabolic activities into the gut microbiome and digestive system for the
prevention and treatment of several gut-related diseases/disorders. Sanarentero is developing
novel drug detoxifying bacteria (DDB), which is a bioengineered live biotherapeutic product that
can detoxify gut-toxic drugs causing chemotherapy-induced diarrhea in cancer patients.
Successfully addressing a major biosafety concern (i.e., the transmission of genetically modified
microbes into humans and environments) will make our product much more competitive since it
will improve clinical adaptability and aid the regulatory approval of our product. Towards improving
the safety profile of DDB, we are introducing a genetic biocontainment switch in our product that
can be triggered to contain the engineered metabolic function as and when needed. Our unique
genetic biocontainment switch (GBS) not only is designed to prevent the engineered metabolic
pathway genes to escape from a designated environment but also performs its function without
killing the microbes to minimize the cellular burden and genetic instability. The overall goal of the
project is to establish the activity and safety of drug detoxifying bacteria equipped with the
proposed genetic biocontainment switch (DDB_GBS) in an animal model. To achieve this goal,
the three specific aims of this phase 1 STTR proposal are 1) to bioengineer genetic
biocontainment switch into DDB; 2) to develop a delayed-release formulation of DDB_GBS
for improved intestinal engraftment; and 3) to evaluate the safety, glycosylation function, and
biocontainment efficiency of DDB_GBS. The success of this project is the proof-of-
concept evidence of our approach for developing novel drug detoxifying bacteria with a safety
feature that can detoxify cancer chemotherapeutic drugs in the gut environment
towards preventing chemotherapeutic-induced diarrhea in cancer patients. Once the
biocontainment efficiency of DDB_GBS is established, we will work on establishing the
preclinical efficacy and manufacturing scale-up in the GMP facility for a phase II SBIR proposal.",  ,,,,RASHIM  SINGH,,(832) 518-9110,rashim.singh@sanarentero.com,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS,  ,

The proposed project will develop a breakthrough endovascular sensor technology to allow for real-time
quantification of the mitral coaptation force (MCF) of the mitral valve during both open and percutaneous mitral
valve repair (MVR). Mitral regurgitation (MR) is the most common heart valve disorder in the U.S. population,
with over 2 million individuals affected. Current methods to assess MVR completion during surgery are lacking,
resulting in up to 25% of patients developing recurrent MR following surgery. New technologies must be
developed to allow surgeons to assess MCF during surgery in order to improve MVR and long term outcomes.
The proposed device, MitralPrint, is an endovascular guidewire with printed piezoelectric sensors on its distal
tip. It is designed to be inserted within the leaflets of the mitral valve to measure MCF in real-time. This innovative
device will allow surgeons to identify repair issues and confirm the successful completion of MVR, which
ultimately improves long term outcomes for patients by reducing MR recurrence. This device builds upon a
substantial amount of work already conducted by the MitralPrint team, including a USPTO/PCT provisional
patent, and ex vivo testing within a porcine heart.
The project will involve iterative prototype development, ultimately leading to an engineering freeze of the device
design, throughout the timeline of the proposal. This process will be informed through 1) benchtop testing to
validate sensor function and device useability, 2) ex vivo testing in a heart simulator to assess the feasibility of
acquiring MCF data in a porcine mitral valve and using this data to judge MR status, and 3) in vivo safety and
feasibility testing in a live animal porcine model, including determining the range of “healthy” MCF.
This project represents an innovative solution to a clear clinical need. The team represents all key aspects
required to ensure success of the project: medical device development, sensor engineering proficiency, and
cardiovascular surgical expertise. The approach is feasible within the anticipated timeline and budget, and is de-
risked through prior work and seasoned advisors.",  ,,,,ANTHONY  MEDIGO,,(917) 576-1502,amedigo@gmail.com,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,  ,

TBI is characterized by an impact to the brain followed by a development of a secondary injury that results from processes initiated by the trauma. The secondary injury occurs in the hours and days following the primary injury and plays a large role in the brain damage and death that results from TBI. There are currently general management guidelines for patients with TBI with no specific neuroprotective interventions available. We propose to validate a novel therapeutic agent for treatment of moderate to severe TBI. AivoCode, Inc. has developed CAQK, a proprietary peptide, for the management of TBI. CAQK specifically targets both penetrating and contusion type of brain injuries and has a pluripotent effect when administered early on in the injury by limiting the secondary damage in TBI. This effect results in improved healing of the injuries as well functional recovery in rodent model of TBI. In this application, we will conduct efficacy studies in pig model of focal TBI and generate a pharmacokinetic profile in a gyrencephalic model of TBI. We will also complete pre-clinical studies that include CMC, formulation development and non-GLP toxicology studies needed for an IND (Investigational New Drug) application for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to initiate clinical trials of CAQK for treatment of TBI.",  ,,,,AMAN  MANN,,8586463190,amann@aivocode.com,,  ,

There were more deaths in Africa from malaria than from COVID-19. There is an urgent unmet medical need for a malaria vaccine that prevents infection and disease in individuals and can be deployed in mass vaccination programs for malaria elimination. The RTS,S malaria vaccine was shown in a pilot implementation program in >900,000 African infants to significantly reduced hospital admissions for malaria by 21% and severe malaria by 30%. In late 2021 it was recommended by WHO for immunization of 5-month-olds. However, it did not significantly reduce cerebral malaria, severe malaria anemia, or overall mortality, or prevent Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infection. Of vaccines under development, only Sanaria’s PfSPZ vaccines have the efficacy against Pf infection to be considered for prevention of Pf infection in individuals or geographically focused Pf malaria elimination campaigns. Sanaria’s 1st generation vaccine, PfSPZ Vaccine, is composed of radiation-attenuated Pf sporozoites (SPZ), which arrest early in the liver stage. Sanaria’s 2nd generation vaccine is PfSPZ-CVac (Chemoprophylaxis Vaccine). In PfSPZ-CVac, the parasites replicate in the liver, biologically amplifying the immunogen load by up to 50,000-fold and then are killed by an anti-malarial drug. PfSPZ-CVac co-administered with chloroquine (CQ), gave 100% vaccine efficacy (VE) against heterologous controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) 12 weeks after vaccination using 22% the dose of PfSPZ needed to achieve 80% VE at 9-10 weeks against heterologous CHMI with PfSPZ Vaccine. PfSPZ-CVac (CQ) is therefore more protective than PfSPZ Vaccine at ~1/5 the dose. However, transient symptoms of malaria can occur after 1st dose of PfSPZ, and if CQ is not administered appropriately, parasite multiplication in the blood could cause severe malaria. In our Phase I grant, to retain the enhanced potency of PfSPZ-CVac and eliminate its drawbacks, we genetically altered Pf to be able to fully replicate, but arrest prior to entering the blood by deleting first one and then a 2nd gene to produce PfSPZ-LARC2 Vaccine and produced a master cell bank (MCB). This vaccine is now being manufactured in compliance with cGMPs to produce PfSPZ-LARC2 Vaccine and will be assessed for safety and efficacy in a clinical trial in the 2nd half of 2022. In this Phase II grant, we propose to 1) manufacture 2 lots of this late arresting, replication competent (LARC) vaccine (PfSPZ-LARC2), which is based on an African Pf parasite, for assessment in expanded clinical trials, 2) manufacture a Thai strain of Pf (NHP4026) containing Asian variant antigens for regulatory agency directed vaccine assessment, and 3) produce a PfSPZ-LARC2 vaccine based on NHP4026 that can be combined with African LARC2 as a pan-global vaccine if needed. The project is intended to produce a potent, cost effective PfSPZ vaccine that protects against highly variant Pf parasites worldwide.",  ,,,,B K SIM,,3015763066,ksim@sanaria.com,,  ,

Millions of women in the U.S. suffer from bacterial vaginosis (BV), a vaginal condition initiated by marked
overgrowth of polymicrobial bacterial populations that can suppress protective lactobacilli. Healthy lactobacilli
(LB), in particular lactobacillus crispatus, secrete lactic acid (LA) that acidifies the vagina and acts as a broad-
spectrum microbicide that protects against many types of pathogens and also can suppress polymicrobial
communities of BV species that produce little or no lactic acid. We do not know what initiates episodes of BV,
but we do know that BV strongly increases risks of many sexually transmitted infections including HIV, and
increases risks of premature births. At any given time, about 1/3 of sexually active women in the U.S. and
world-wide have BV. Antibiotics can provide transient relief from the foul-smelling discharge caused by BV but
they do not prevent BV from recurring (sometimes at a frequency up to twice a month). There is no product on
the market that can provide sustained protection against BV. We and others have shown that LA can potently
inactivate many types of BV-associated bacteria as well as many types of pathogens that cause sexually
transmitted infections. Since LA is abundant in the healthy vaginas of women with protective LB, particularly in
women with Lactobacillus crispatus (L.c), it has the potential to serve as a safe, non-antibiotics microbicide.
We have recently determined the rate at which healthy lactobacilli continuously produce LA and hence for the
first time know the rate at which lactic acid should be supplied to the vagina to treat and prevent BV. This in
turn guided our development of an LA-releasing intravaginal ring (LA-IVR) that can provide sustained
release of LA over 30 days at the rate needed to treat and prevent BV while not suppressing healthy LB. We
have further synthesized macaque-sized LA-IVR that, when inserted into the macaque vagina, could lower the
vaginal pH substantially without causing any toxicity. Building on our promising work, we seek to combine this
LA-IVR with a L.c probiotics in the form of capsules containing lyophilized L.c powder, in order to achieve a
synergistic alteration to the vaginal environment to best promote the re-establishment of a L.c-dominated
microflora. In Aim 1, we plan to identify a lead strain of L.c based on growth rates as well as acidification rates
and extent, then formulate them into lyophilized powders and load into capsules. In Aim 2, we will fabricate the
macaque-sized LA-IVRs, and test whether combinatorial treatment of sustained LA release by this IVR with the
L.c probiotics capsules can suppress BV-like bacterial species in pigtail macaques. Successful demonstration
of safety and efficacy in this highly relevant large animal model would support the design requirements of an
optimal LB-LA-IVR that Mucommune can advance through IND-enabling activities. The simplicity of our LA-IVR
and L.c loaded capsule designs ensures both ease of production and likely very low manufacturing costs of the
eventual product, which in turn should maximize potential public health impact and commercial viability of the
product both in the U.S. and in low and middle income countries worldwide.",  ,,,,KEIICHIRO  KUSHIRO,,(919) 813-8691,kushiro@mucommune.com,,  ,

The value of computational chemistry to commercial drug discovery is now well-established. Virtual screening
(including molecular docking) now jumpstarts most discovery efforts. More recently, a combination of GPU and
cloud based computing has vastly increased the realistic computational throughput available for drug
discovery. In turn, this has ignited substantial interest in relative free energy calculations (e.g. Free Energy
Perturbation, FEP) for drug lead enhancement. FEP has been applied at the fringes of drug discovery for
decades, but massive parallelism in the more recent past has moved FEP to center stage, and FEP has
helped shave months or years off discovery efforts where these calculations are reliable.
The catch is that FEP calculations are not always reliable. While for some systems, the error in a FEP result is
much less than one kcal/mol--and they have successfully steered slow/expensive bench efforts--there are
other systems where the predictions are not very useful. Even where retrospective analysis is possible, it is
often not very clear why FEP calculations are so good for some target systems, and so bad for others. Broadly,
the limitations of FEP can be distilled down to three problems: A poor description of the energetics (force field);
insufficient sampling; or a misunderstanding of the fundamental science (e.g., incorrect protein model, wrong
binding site, wrong protonation state, etc.). It is generally believed that many issues arise from the first of
these—and improving the evaluation of energetics using quantum mechanics (QM) will be the focus here.
There is a huge interest in methods that can help obviate the existing problems with FEP. Herein, we propose
a new platform for FEP, which incorporates a quantum mechanical description of the molecular interaction of
central interest. The traditional force field used with FEP is a simplified analytic expression with fit coefficients
termed Molecular Mechanics (MM). MM is a simple approximation of the true molecular interactions that can
be described using quantum mechanics. But QM has been, until recently, far too expensive to use in the
context of the molecular dynamics (MD) sampling required for FEP.
At long last, we have determined how to integrate QM into the FEP paradigm, using a carefully programmed
distributed processing platform that lends itself to use on commodity cloud computers, and by integrating a
semiempirical QM implementation that provides predictions that are much better than those from MM, but at a
cost far less than for a full DFT QM prediction. Our implementation allows FEP calculations with a realistic QM
core region of hundreds of atoms to be carried out with the scale of sampling associated with accurate FEP
calculations and with turnaround commensurate with modern drug discovery. Here, we propose to validate this
platform against traditional MM-based FEP, to show it addresses many of the issues of that approach. We will
also identify additional implementation ideas to further improve effective throughput and/or accuracy.",  ,,,,DAVID A PEARLMAN,,(617) 899-6634,pearlman@qsimulate.com,,  ,

This STTR Phase I project proposes to utilize high alcohol content feedstocks using catalyst innovation comprising engineered amine treatment of cation-exchanged zeolites. The catalyst has been shown to outperform numerous previously-utilized catalysts with greater than90% yields of acrylic products during catalyzed dehydration of lactic acid. So far, those in the field have investigated feeds containing aqueous solutions of methyl lactate or lactic acid in concentrations from 10-40%. Methanol has not been used as a co-feed in concentrations greater than 5%, therefore this project will investigate higher concentrations of alcohols (5%-80%, using methanol or ethanol).The project will use both methanol and ethanol as the alcohol size is likely to alter active site reactivity and/or shift the equilibrium of esterified versus acidic acrylate products. These experiments address two areas of concern in the commercialization of the technology and determine the relative dehydration rates of ethanol and lactic acid under competitive adsorption conditions to provide foundational information required for reactor scaling. The proposed research also increases the percentage of alkyl acrylates formed by forcing the gas phase esterification of acrylic acid with alcohol towards completion._x000D_

Today’s non-invasive brain stimulation approaches apply generic stimulation waveforms without targeting individual activity signatures and without dynamically adapting stimulation to ongoing fluctuations in brain activity. To address this gap, the long-term goal of Pulvinar Neuro is to develop, evaluate, and commercialize targeted closed-loop transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) technology, which measures brain activity with EEG and dynamically applies weak rhythmic electric fields to modulate network oscillations. In the previous Phase 1 SBIR, Pulvinar Neuro developed XCSITE 100Pro, a closed-loop tACS device that was successfully tested for feasibility in healthy human participants, and XCSITE 200, a cloud-based platform for remote stimulation. The overall goal of this application is to develop and evaluate the XCSITE 300 platform that will integrate closed-loop capabilities with cloud-based stimulation and study management. The rationale for this project is that such a solution will drive the next generation of circuit-based research in psychiatry and that closed-loop tACS has the potential to become a safe and effective treatment for depression given the initial positive findings of open-loop tACS for the treatment of depression and the substantial unmet market need. Three specific aims will be pursued to accomplish this goal. (1) Integrate and bench test closed-loop tACS technology with cloud-based infrastructure, (2) Test XCSITE 300 for in-lab use in a pilot double-blind single-site study for the treatment of depression (XCSITE 300 Clinic), and (3) Adapt device form factor and user interface for at-home use (XCSITE 300 Home) and establish feasibility in a pilot study in people with depression. At completion of the proposed work, feasibility and preliminary efficacy of closed-loop tACS will be established and closed-loop tACS for use in a clinic and for at-home use by patients will be ready for pivotal studies for the treatment of depression. The work in this application is innovative given the lack of available cloud-enabled (“smart”) closed-loop tACS devices for probing circuit dynamics and for evaluation of clinical efficacy in rigorous double-blind trials. The proposed work is significant since closed-loop tACS will enable the investigation of the causal role of specific circuit dynamics in humans and the development of novel treatments for depression which are urgently needed.",  ,,,,LEAH B TOWNSEND,,9196232171,leah.townsend@pulvinarneuro.com,,  ,

an outstanding individual, Dr. Kamala Sundararaj, to work on our Phase I STTR grant directed at translation of
ice-free cryopreservation of heart valves for pediatrics and be trained in small business entrepreneurship.
Heart valve replacement in children is a serious problem because there are no heart valve implants that grow
with the patient. The valves that are currently employed need to be changed as the patient grows with a very
high associated mortality rate (~40%). In response to this clinical need, we are pioneering an entirely new
approach to deliver growing heart valve implants, which we are calling partial heart transplantation (PHT). PHT
differs from heart transplantation because only the part of the heart containing a valve is transplanted. Based
on our preliminary data in immunosuppressed piglets, we recently performed the world’s first human partial
heart transplant on 4/22/2022 with demonstrated valve growth. However, the chance of a donor partial heart
transplant being available at just the right time is low. Therefore, we propose development of a network of
tissue banks with technology licenses at major pediatric cardiovascular medical centers nationwide in
preparation for clinical application. Our central hypothesis is that vitrified and nanowarmed PHTs can fulfill both
their hemodynamic and biological functions after orthotopic transplantation in growing children. In this Phase I
proposal there are three specific aims: First we propose optimization of short-term preservation protocols. Our
working hypothesis for this aim is that PHTs will tolerate longer post-mortem cold ischemic times than intact
hearts. The impact of procurement and refrigeration on piglet-derived PHTs will be evaluated by assessment
of viability in vitro. This will establish the anticipated geographic range for PHT procurement after dissection
based upon estimated refrigerated travel time. In the second specific aim we will optimize vitrification protocols
for PHTs. Our working hypothesis for this aim is that ice-free cryo-preservation employing tissue vitrification,
rapid nanowarming and apoptosis inhibition developed for adult porcine pulmonary heart valves can be further
optimized for smaller PHTs required for pediatric cases. Different cryoprotectant loading times, exposure
conditions, and apoptosis inhibitors will be evaluated by assessment of viability in vitro. This will establish the
optimal vitrification protocol for pediatric PHTs. In the final aim we will evaluate post-transplant growth, leaflet
viability and hemodynamic function of optimally vitrified and nanowarmed cryopreserved PHTs. Our working
hypothesis for this aim is that optimized protocols will allow vitrified PHTs that were banked for one month to
function in vivo like fresh PHTs. The optimized protocols developed in the earlier aims will be evaluated in a
swine leukocyte antigen matched growing immunosuppressed piglet PHT model by transplantation. This will
establish the PHT vitrification, warming, and banking methods for future clinical application. At the conclusion
of these aims it is anticipated that Dr. Sundaraj will have the necessary tools to establish herself as a
successful independent investigator and become an entrepreneur.",  ,,,,TAUFIEK K RAJAB,,(617) 901-2638,rajabt@musc.edu,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,  ,

annually. Pancreatic necrosis occurs in about 20% of patients who have severe acute pancreatitis. One in three
of these patients will develop infected pancreatic necrosis, which is associated with mortality rates of 11 -39%.
Treatment of infected acute necrotizing pancreatitis is crucial to prevent ongoing infection and sepsis-related
multiorgan failure. Minimally invasive direct endoscopic techniques have become the preferred method of
enabling surgical debridement of pancreatic necrosis. A significant limitation of these procedures is the lack of
instruments capable of safely and effectively removing necrotic tissue. Advanced therapeutic endoscopists,
trained on stent-enabled access to the pancreas through the stomach wall, are currently using manual
instruments and accessories designed for other indications. As a result, removal of necrotic tissue requires
multiple instrument passes and an average of 4 separate debridement sessions. The ineffectiveness of off-label
instrument use directly contributes to overall procedure-related adverse events of between 21% - 36% and
lengthy hospital stays for an already challenged patient population. HydroCision has developed a proprietary
method of controlling a hair-thin, supersonic stream of sterile saline while simultaneously enabling an in-line
Venturi suction system to cut and remove tissue of various densities from a surgical site in a minimally invasive
manner. It has commercialized rigid forms of the technology in the fields of wound care and orthopedics. To
meet the unmet need in the gastrointestinal space, the Company is developing G.I.Jet, a dedicated instrument
designed to debride necrotic tissue from the pancreas in a single-session without negatively impacting healthy
tissue. Adaptation of its technology for direct endoscopic necrosectomy will require the system be made flexible,
smaller in diameter, and capable of safely transmitting high-pressure sterile saline over longer operative
distances. It will also require adjusting saline-flow rates and instrument configuration parameters such that the
system is capable of discernably resecting necrotic pancreatic tissue without disrupting healthy adjacent issue
and structures. The long-term goal of the project is to develop an effective dedicated application capable of
single-session debridement of pancreatic necrosis, thereby reducing procedure-related complications and
associated length of hospital stays among a patient population of high morbidity and mortality. The company will
demonstrate feasibility through bench-top studies designed to test a flexible, endoscopically compatible
prototype on surrogate tissue models followed by an animal study designed to assess and determine fluidjet
velocity, suction forces and instrument configuration required for discernable resection. The Company’s
technology platform is uniquely positioned to become the technology of choice for gastroenterologists trained on

Self-developing, instant radiochromic films based on the solid-state polymerization of diacetylenes (R-C≡C-C≡C-
R’, where R and R’ are substituent groups) are used for measuring radiation therapy dose. Currently available
radiochromic films, e.g., the GafChromicTM EBT films from Ashland (Bridgewater, NJ, USA), have many
drawbacks such as they are very expensive, sensitive to water and ambient UV light, requiring cold storage and
shipping, a short shelf-life, delamination of the coating if bent sharply or cut, non-uniform coating requiring a
yellow dye for thickness correction, etc. These shortcomings have prevented their broader use in radiation
therapy clinics. Hence, there is a strong need for more economical radiochromic films, which do not have the
drawbacks of commercially available radiochromic films. One of the principal investigators, G.N. Patel, is one of
the early pioneers in the field of diacetylenes and is still active in the field. His company, JP Laboratories, Inc.,
has developed radiation dosimeters and radiochromic films for radiation protection and other non-medical
applications. Utilizing his extensive experience in diacetylene chemistry and synthesis, we will synthesize a class
of diacetylenes, which have a chromophoric group as a substituent group, e.g., R = (CH2)n-OCONH-(CH2)n-A,
where n=1-4, A is a light yellow color chromophoric group. The chromophoric diacetylenes (CD) will be produced
by reacting diacetylene diols with chromophoric isocyanates. Then, CD-based emulsion, a coating formulation,
will be prepared and uniformly coated on a polyester film substrate to create a CD film. Diacetylene diols are
significantly less expensive than those used to make GafChromicTM films. The radiochromic films made from
chromophoric diacetylenes, the CD film, will have none of the drawbacks of GafChromicTM films. The
chromophoric group will absorb UV light. Hence the CD film will not develop color upon exposure to ambient UV
light. The CD film will not require a yellow marker for the thickness correction because the CD is yellow.
Diacetylenes with urethane (- OCONH-) functionality usually have a higher melting point (above 100°C), resulting
in a longer shelf-life, and are not affected by water/humidity. Because of the high melting point of CD, the CD
film can be briefly heated to eliminate the post-irradiation change of measured dose, allowing an instant reading
of the radiation dose. In the first stage of the project, small quantities of chromophoric diacetylenes will be
synthesized, inks/emulsions made of CD will be coated on a substrate to make the radiochromic films, and the
prototype films will be evaluated. The best performing CD film will be selected, and a sufficient quantity of the
film will be made for the extensive evaluation for radiation therapy applications. In the second stage, the chosen
CD film will be assessed for the effect of dose, dose rate, energy, UV light, water/humidity, and heat (shelf-life).

diseases. Recently, two AAV based gene therapy drugs have been approved by the FDA, Luxturna been
valued at $850,000 with a one-time application for blindness and Zolgensma at $2,100,000 for spinal muscle
atrophy. AAV vector mediated gene therapy has shown to be a potentially huge market. Although successful in
clinical studies for neurological disorders, one of the major concerns for effective AAV brain application is high
prevalence of neutralizing antibody (Nab) in humans. In the general human population, over 95 % of
individuals are infected by AAV and, on average, 50 % of them develop Nabs. The inhibition effect of Nabs on
AAV brain transduction has been well documented regardless of delivery routes (direct intra-brain injection or
systemic administration). Several approaches have been exploited to escape AAV Nabs, including chemical
modification, use of different AAV vector serotypes, AAV capsid engineering, and biological depletion of Nab
titer (empty capsid utilization, B cell depletion, plasma-apheresis, and Ig proteases). Generally, these
approaches have low efficiency, unwanted side effects, or AAV tropism change. Recently, Nabgen has
developed a vector independent protein-based strategy to universally block Nabs using a unique mycoplasma
derived protein, termed Protein-M. Protein-M is able to interact with immunoglobulin from any species without
antigen dependence by binding to variable regions on the antibody light and heavy chains. Using human IVIG
and serum from AAV immunized mice, we have found that Protein-M reduced AAV vector neutralization over
100 fold when compared to control group without Protein-M in vitro. Most importantly, we have observed that
Protein-M was able to retain AAV transduction over 1000 fold in mice with adoptive transfer of Nab positive
serum. So far, this is the most effective strategy to evade AAV Nabs. To explore the application of Protein-M in
patients with AAV brain targeted therapy, it is imperative to address the efficacy of Protein-M to protect AAV
from Nabs for brain transduction in subjects with Nabs. In this proposal, we will first study the effect of Protein-
M co-administered with AAV vectors on AAV Nab blockage via direct injection into the brain in mice with pre-
immunization of AAV (Aim 1). Next, we will study the effect of Protein-M via systemic injection on brain
transduction after direct delivery of AAV vectors (Aim 2). If successful, this novel and effective technology will
extend the benefits of AAV targeted gene therapy to every patient with brain disorders and AAV Nabs.",  ,,,,CHARLES H ASKEW,,(919) 213-1173,charles.askew@gmail.com,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL,  ,

We will develop an automated software engine for plaque characterization and EEM segmentation using intra-
vascular OCT (IVOCT) images, creating a powerful tool in order to efficiently guide stent implantation during
PCI. Coronary artery disease (CAD) and its clinical complications are a leading cause of death, disability, and
escalating healthcare costs worldwide. Contemporary CAD treatment frequently involves percutaneous coro-
nary intervention (PCI) with metal stents in order to resolve obstructive blockages that impede coronary blood
flow. While PCI has proven to be effective, subsequent stent failure from restenosis (scar tissue) and throm-
bosis (blood clotting) limit the durability of PCI results and are associated with significant morbidity and mortali-
ty. Moreover, stent failure has been specifically linked to inadequate stent expansion, incomplete stent cover-
age of diseased segments, and untreated dissections at the stent edges.Recently, high-resolution intravascular imaging guidance during PCI has been demonstrated to reduce ad-
verse cardiac events by optimizing stent implantation and mitigating structural risks factors for stent failure.
However, despite improved patient outcomes, intravascular imaging using ultrasound (IVUS) and optical co-
herence tomography (IVOCT) remain severely underutilized in clinical practice. In part, intravascular imaging
adoption has been hampered by the need for operators with variable proficiency in image interpretation to per-
form manual image analysis on a large volume of data in real-time during the PCI procedure. This creates a
scenario where difficulty in image interpretation and an overload of image data (270-500 image frames in a
single pull-back) may lead to clinical decision making that relies on incomplete information.We will build upon significant preliminary results and create robust, highly automated methods for identify-
ing calcium and lipid deposits in IVOCT image pullbacks, as well as true vessel sizing by automatically deter-
mining the location of the EEM. We will: (1) Acquire and label a large, unique dataset of in-vivo IVOCT image
volumes. (2) Develop modern machine-learning algorithms for plaque classification and compare against car-
diologist readers. (3) Conduct a retrospective validation study to determine how IVOCT with plaque visualiza-
tion might affect clinical interventions. (4) Deploy our solution on our cloud platform, LibbyTM, making the soft-
ware accessible world-wide, facilitating multinational usage and on-going validation and refinement. We antici-
pate that our software will: (1) determine significant lipid and calcium deposits as good as, or better than, ex-
pert analysts; (2) incorporate the generated data efficiently into clinical workflow by enhancing pre-PCI imaging
to comprehensively map plaque morphology and define appropriate stent landing zones; (3) inform operators
on the need for specialized plaque modification techniques such as cutting/scoring balloons or atherectomy;
and (4) reliably automate stent sizing by EEM measurements to streamline equipment selection.",  ,,,,RONNY  SHALEV,,(617) 480-9569,ronny@dyadmed.com,,  ,

SaCas9 is a major gene editing nuclease that is preferred for in vivo applications thanks to its
relatively smaller size compared to that of spCas9. One limiting factor for the use of saCas9 is
its strict PAM requirement of NNGRRT. In addition, there are limited efforts to reduce saCas9’s
off-target editing rates. In Aim 1, we propose a computational approach to relax saCas9’s PAM
requirement. We hypothesize that the interactions between key PAM recognition (KPR)
residues of saCas9 and the side chains of PAM nucleotides determine the PAM requirement,
and that mutating KPR residues by destroying their interactions with the DNA side chain while
introducing favorable interactions with the DNA main chain will relax the PAM requirement. We
have demonstrated the feasibility to relax the PAM requirement to NNNRRT in preliminary work.
Here we will develop and optimize a computational method UniDesign to engineer saCas9s with
further relaxed NNNRRN PAM (rr-saCas9s). In Aim 2, we propose to improve rr-saCas9’s
safety. Recently we reported the development of mispCas9, in which a small size (36 amino
acids) HDR (homology-directed repair)-promoting peptide Brex27 was fused to spCas9.
Compared to spCas9, mispCas9 leads to increased knock-in rates as well as reduced off-target
insertion and deletion (indel) events. Importantly, Brex27 can be used as a “plug and play”
module to improve other gene-editing nucleases as long as their mechanism of action depends
on the generation of double-strand breaks (DSB) of the genome. Here we will fuse Brex27 to rr-
saCas9 (mirr-saCas9), and conduct experiments to characterize mirr-saCas9, in comparison
with rr-saCas9 and saCas9, with a focus on PAM requirement, on-target editing efficacy, and
off-target rates. The proposed mirr-saCas9, if successful, will add favorable features to saCas9
including: (i) 16 times more targetable sequences as a result of the relaxed PAM requirement
(NNNRRN vs NNGRRT); and (ii) reduced off-target indel rates as a result of enhanced HDR at
off-target sites. Furthermore, the validated computational model is adaptable for the
improvement of other CRISPR variants for PAM modification and other desirable engineering.",  ,,,,XIAOQIANG  HUANG,,(734) 680-3550,xiaoqiah@umich.edu,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,  ,

The United States produces 10 million metric tons of hydrogen per year - 95% of it via steam methane reforming (SMR).SMR emits 100 million tons of CO2 in the process. This represents a greater than$10 billion market in the US alone and an important opportunity to reduce CO2 emissions. Methane pyrolysis promises green hydrogen with greater than5 times less energy than water electrolysis at costs competitive with steam methane reforming by producing solid carbon instead of gaseous carbon dioxide. The solid carbon, if produced correctly, can be used in tires, batteries, and concrete. The research in this project could increase the value of the solid carbon by-product produced alongside clean hydrogen in methane pyrolysis. If successful, this technology could lead to expanded domestic production capabilities with net-zero emissions from sectors such as fertilizer, transportation (batteries, fuel cells, synthetic fuels, and tires), and heavy industry (steel and cement)._x000D_

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel method to tune the production of high-quality solid carbon using methane pyrolysis. Carbon black forms in pyrolysis reactors both homogeneously in the gas phase and heterogeneously on catalysts, reactor walls, and on seed particles entrained in the gas. By tuning temperature, residence time, flow profile, and seed materials, this project will result in an improved understanding of carbon precipitation and formation in methane pyrolysis reactors. This improved understanding and the development of a reactor thermochemical model will ultimately lead to better control of a process to produce high quality solid carbon that can be used in tires, batteries, and concrete._x000D_

Language access solutions in healthcare have focused almost exclusively on the provision of verbal medical
interpretation, despite federal and state laws that mandate translation of written information for patients with
limited English proficiency (LEP). In recent years, machine translation (MT) has made significant strides, but
when it comes to mission-critical technical materials such as healthcare information, the accuracy rate of
machine-only translations plummets. Thus, experts recommend MT as a starting point for translating
health-related material then supplementing with human quality assurance editing. However, coordinating
machine translation with bilingual human editors who have technical medical knowledge is a challenge,
especially for less commonly supported languages. Translation vendors currently pass on the associated costs
of human assistance to healthcare institutions. The Canopy Translate project will address these deficits by
implementing a novel, human-assisted machine translation (HAMT) process. The envisioned workflow
management platform will leverage MT engines to expedite the initial rendering of source documents into a
target language, then invite bilingual healthcare professionals around the world to apply human editing to the
machine-generated translation. The bilingual contributors, who will gain complimentary access to our Medical
English eLearning courses as an incentive for their participation, will complete the editing task through gamified
learning exercises. For example, a nurse in the Philippines has native fluency in Tagalog and advanced
general English but desires to improve his medical English. He can edit a machine-generated Tagalog
translation one sentence at a time in the form of a gamified activity. Other contributors will edit the same text for
additional quality assurance to form the final, polished version in Tagalog. The system will then organize the
final translated content into a reusable document library. In Phase I, we will test the feasibility of this hybrid
HAMT approach for medical content. Upon meeting feasibility benchmarks, we will advance to Phase II, during
which we will create a minimum viable product, encompassing several novel natural language processing
(NLP) algorithms, and evaluate the translation output according to a set of quality benchmarks. If successful,
this project will significantly improve the availability, speed, and cost-effectiveness of producing multilingual
health content, with potential to reduce health disparities in LEP populations.",  ,,,,KATHERINE  RIESTENBERG,,(202) 505-4075,kriestenberg@t19s.com,,  ,

In this proposal, we seek to significantly reduce the computational time (now around 500,000 CPU hours) required to obtain accurate free energy profiles of enzymatic reactions. Specifically, we propose to use a multiple time step (MTS) simulation method, where a low-level (and less accurate) quantum chemistry or machine learning model is used to propagate the system (i.e. move all atoms) at each time step (usually 0.5 or 1 fs), and then a high-level (i.e. more accurate and expensive) quantum chemistry method is used to correct the force on the atoms at longer time intervals. In this way, the simulation can be performed at the high- level energy surface in a fraction of time, compared with simulations performed only using the high-level quantum chemical method. In the Phase I proposal, we successfully re-parameterized low-level quantum chemistry models and developed machine learning models for MTS simulations. Through these developments, we were able to extend the high-level force update to only once every 8 fs or longer. In the Phase II period, we will further improve and automate the workflow for developing the low-cost models, which will further enhance the computational efficiency of our MTS simulations. In addition, these advances will be combined by the EnzyDock method to facilitate the study of multi-step enzyme reactions and the design of covalent/noncovalent inhibitors and mutant enzymes.

Recent studies have revealed the re-emergence of this parasite in the USA. The burden of hookworm infection is generally associated with chronic illness rather than mortality in the host. Anemia, stunted development, and intellectual and cognitive deficiencies are among the most serious outcomes of persistent hookworm infections in children and women of reproductive age. In addition, chronic low-intensity hookworm infection reduces vaccine efficacy and exacerbates other globally relevant infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, and HIV, which are co-endemic with hookworm. Current strategies to control hookworm rely primarily on the Mass Drug Administration of anthelminthic drugs. However, recent evidence calls into question the long-term effectiveness of this approach to control and eliminate hookworm in endemic populations, raising concern about the emergence of drug resistance. The current method to screen for STH infections is microscopic demonstration and quantification of eggs in the stool. For screening, WHO considers the Kato-Katz thick smear as a benchmark for diagnosing hookworm infection. This method, however, has poor sensitivity. Processing multiple smears per sample or examining multiple samples over consecutive days can increase the sensitivity of the Kato-Katz thick smear. While screening multiple samples improves sensitivity, it presents considerable logistical and financial challenges and is not practical in all settings. To address this, WHO recently published a Target Product Profile for soil-transmitted helminths to develop low-cost screening tools that meet demands, currently not met by the Kato-Katz thick smear. To address this need, in Phase I we propose the development of an ELISA to screen for human IgG against hookworm infection. In collaboration with Yale University, we will perform a combination of in-silico and in-vitro studies, to help characterize biomarkers of interest (Aim 1), which will be used in the development of an ELISA (Aim 2). We will then evaluate assay performance (Aim 2) using well-characterized cohorts of serum samples. Our goal is to achieve sensitivity and specificity as outlined in the TPP, with further improvement in Phase II. The proposed commercial ELISA kit will allow for the replacement of the existing, relatively insensitive microscopic tools, to integrate as part of monitoring and evaluation programs for hookworm infection around the world.

allow physicians to visualize blood vessels. Today, this technology is utilized for minimally-invasive interventions that
treat numerous devastating pathologies, including stroke and myocardial infarction, diseases that disproportionally
impact underserved minority patient populations.Catheter angiography is performed by inserting a small catheter into an artery, injecting iodinated contrast
through the catheter, and recording a series of X-Ray images as the contrast traverses the patient’s blood vessels.
However, superimposed X-Ray densities from bones and soft tissues obscure the imaging details of the blood vessels. In
ideal conditions, DSA will provide an image of the vessels alone, unobscured by superimposed bone and soft tissue.
Indeed, during angiography of cooperative awake patients, who are instructed to hold their breath to reduce motion,
DSA can produce excellent images. However, DSA images are markedly degraded by all voluntary, respiratory, or cardiac
motion that occurs during the exam. During routine clinical practice, it is common to discard and repeat angiographic
acquisitions due to excessive motion. In situations where patients are unable to remain still, which may be due to
difficulty breathing or the distress of an acute stroke, the poor quality of motion-degraded DSA imaging increases the
risk of complex procedures such as stroke clot removal and cardiac stenting.We have developed a deep learning algorithm that can perform the task of DSA even in the setting of substantial
motion. We utilize a cutting edge Vision-Transformer-based network architecture, which is optimized to use the spatial
and temporal information in the images to identify the blood vessels and separate them from the other X-ray densities
such as bone and soft tissue. Furthermore, we have developed a novel data-augmentation mechanism to train this
data-hungry neural network to outperform DSA and alternative U-Net-based architectures during patient motion.In this grant application, we propose to implement our innovative algorithm on a product-oriented, low-latency,

quality produced by of this edge hardware product. In the validation step, physicians in Neurology, Radiology, and

data after the angiogram is complete. At the end of our funding period, we will deliver a validated, low-latency, edge

Varenicline (CHANTIX®) is currently the leading FDA-approved oral medica0on for smoking cessa0on. However, only 22% of pa0ents maintain abs0nence for 52 weeks aNer varenicline treatment. Addi0onally, more than 67% of pa0ents prematurely discon0nue treatment, indica0ng a need for therapies that improve pa0ent compliance. To address this, we have developed extended-release prodrugs that aim to enhance the pharmacokine0c proper0es of varenicline. Varenicline works by reducing nico0ne craving and use by increasing dopamine levels transiently and then blocking the dopamine response to nico0ne. These changes stabilize dopamine signaling in the brain, reducing the side eﬀects of temporary dopamine increases and prolonging the drug's ability to reduce the reward value of nico0ne. In our STTR Phase I grant, we will use an in vivo dopamine biosensor to evaluate real-0me dopamine levels in the striatum aNer administering our novel prodrugs. We will establish a rela0onship between brain eﬃcacy and drug levels in vivo. These studies will allow us to screen for prodrugs that have op0mal eﬃcacy in altering both the level and dura0on of dopamine response, which serves as a biomarker for predic0ng the eﬀec0veness of smoking cessa0on drugs. Our ini0al pilot data show that, compared to varenicline, our prodrugs posi0vely alter the dopamine release proﬁle in the striatum. As the developers of a novel drug for smoking cessa0on, we are seeking mentorship to gain a beZer understanding of the market forces that will determine the success or failure of our approach to this signiﬁcant health challenge. The I- Corps™ program will guide and enable us to reach out to relevant stakeholders, such as prospec0ve pa0ents, physicians, insurers, regulators, and pharmaceu0cal companies.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will result in the first accurate, affordable, and convenient sunscreen effectiveness indicator. Though other photochromic (UV-sensitive and color-changing) sunscreen effectiveness indicators exist in the marketplace, they are inaccurate (temperature and UVA1 sensitivities cause reporting errors), expensive (greater than$0.60 per use) and inconvenient (stickers and wristband formats) which largely account for their lack of market adoption. This project will result in the first stamp-on-skin photochromic sunscreen effectiveness indicator in two formats: a stand-alone stamp that will work with any sunscreen and a stamp-in-cap format that is built into the sunscreen’s cap. It will also result in two different photochromic ink formulations (one for use with sunscreen lotions and another for sunscreen sprays) which will be stamped onto user’s skin and accurately report—at-a-glance and in real-time the degree of users’ sun protection so they can apply and reapply the right amount of sunscreen at the right time.A single stamp will last an entire day in wet or dry conditions and withstand multiple color-fade and sunscreen reapplication cycles._x000D_

First, our Sense pattern recognition control system (and associated Element low-profile surface EMG electrodes and FlexCell flexible lithium-polymer batteries) can interface with most myoelectric hands, wrists, and elbows on the market. Second, our MyoTrain virtual-limb pre-prosthetic training system has been demonstrated to help individuals with ULL learn to use pattern recognition. This system is valuable in the “golden window” time period after amputation but before it is feasible to fit the patient with a definitive prosthesis. Based on our clinical experience, we identified three ways in which we could deepen our clinical impact, particularly as related to the MyoTrain system. First, we noted that EMG classification accuracy could be improved by decreasing intra-class scatter (improving repeatability) and/or increasing inter-class separation (improving separability). How individuals incorporate these methods is user specific and they could benefit from the incorporation of visual feedback – something that we call “Active Coaching”. Second, our business model allows us to provide MyoTrain to the patient before reimbursement is available, which offers significant clinical advantage. However, this currently still requires the prosthetist to fabricate a check socket for use with each individual. We now propose to integrate a reusable wireless armband which would eliminate this issue. Third, we plan to evaluate the efficacy of MyoTrain with a prospective trial of our technology suite and associated clinical methodology. Specifically, we will test three hypotheses: 1) use of MyoTrain results in skills transference to control of the final prosthesis; 2) the virtual outcome measures in MyoTrain are correlated with real-world functional outcome measures; and 3) use of MyoTrain results in improved clinical outcomes as measured by functional, subjective and usage metrics. The capstone of this project is the submission of a 510(k) premarket notification application for the MyoTrain system.",  ,,,,RAHUL R KALIKI,,4434517177,rahul@i-biomed.com,,  ,

experimental work for E1v1.11, a novel drug candidate for Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). SMA is an autosomal
recessive disorder that is the leading genetic cause of infantile death worldwide, occurring in ~1:10,000 live
births. The gene responsible for SMA is called survival motor neuron-1 (SMN1). SMN2 is nearly identical to
SMN1, however, mutations in SMN2 have no clinical consequence if SMN1 is retained. SMN2 cannot prevent
disease development in the absence of SMN1 due to the fact that the majority of SMN2-derived transcripts are
alternatively spliced, resulting in a non-functional and unstable protein. However, since SMN2 is present in all
SMA patients and the overlapping protein coding sequence is still capable of producing “normal” SMN, the
presence of SMN2 opens the door to a number of exciting therapeutic strategies including modulating the
pathogenic alternative splicing of SMN2 exon 7.Previously, we optimized a variety of phosphorodiamidate Morpholino oligomer (PMO)-based ASOs and have
identified a lead candidate (E1v1.11) that exhibits greater efficacy across a range of doses examined in cellular
and animal models of SMA. We have compared these results to published results of Spinraza (the current
market leading drug for treating SMA patients) in the same animal models (and similar dosing regimen) and
show a 12x-fold improvement in animal survival and a 150x-fold increase in maximum tolerated dose. We have
also demonstrated that the manufacturing methods currently being used to synthesize E1v1.11 meet FDA
requirement for approvable GMP manufacturing.Shift has received feedback from the FDA regarding our proposed IND experiments in a pre-pre-IND
meeting. We plan to conduct all of the IND enabling experiments (both CMC and pre-clinical) that will allow
initial Phase 1 clinical trials to begin at the conclusion of this project. We will conduct safety experiments
(following written FDA feedback from our pre-IND meeting) on both juvenile Sprague-Dawley rats and non-
human primates under GLP protocols using our drug substance and drug products manufactured under GMP
in preparation for our IND filing and clinical studies. Finally, Shift has recruited opinion leaders in the SMA
space to join our Clinical Advisory Board. They have helped the company to identify a “key” patient need in the
SMA space, namely improved therapeutic responses in adult SMA patients compared to currently available
drugs. They will assist with the development of clinical trial protocols during this grant.SMA is a complex genetic disorder with a broad clinical spectrum. With the 2016 FDA approval of the first
SMA-specific drug (Spiranza), it is important to continue to the development of SMA therapeutics. We believe
an E1 ASO Morpholino will be an exciting and valuable addition to the SMA portfolio to further combat this
devastating disease.",  ,,,,STEVE  OCONNOR,,(626) 893-2514,caltechsteve@gmail.com,,  ,

Since dropping out of school is a gradual process of a student becoming disengaged in the classroom, the proposed project will address school dropout at the most elemental level. At the end of this project, the development team will have an innovative, web-based game that will transform the classroom dynamic, in any school, and give teachers meaningful analytics so they can better meet their student’s needs, keep them engaged in the learning process, and reduce the number of kids dropping out of school.

The intellectual merit of this project is in the quantitative measurement and tracking of student engagement and production of a longitudinal analysis for each student, so teachers can track engagement throughout an entire quarter, semester, or year.The solution will empower instructors to make more well-informed decisions for their classrooms. The research will focus on converting the original composite, laborious, pen, paper, and spreadsheet version of the tool into a web-based version that integrates with teacher lessons while accommodating diverse content areas and a multitude of teaching styles. As students interact with the web-based, gamified lesson delivery platform, they can earn or lose virtual dollars while learning valuable soft skills such as such as responsibility, critical thinking, and work ethics, including financial literacy skills such as online banking, investing, using credit, and budgeting. This project will harness the game platform quality to capture students' attention and generate motivation to invest time and energy into learning. In the process, the game will collect valuable learning metrics and provide reports and analytics for teachers so they can learn more about their students.

worldwide. Half of all Americans over the age of 30 and 70% of those over age 65 suffer some degree of P.
gingivalis infection associated with gum disease. In a study of 6800 patients with gum disease that were
followed for up to 26 years, those that developed gingivitis and then periodontal disease were linked to a
significantly increased risk of dementia including Alzheimer's dementia. Tooth loss, a frequent outcome of
periodontal disease, was also associated with an increased the risk of dementia. P. gingivalis products
including lipopolysaccharide, cysteine proteases known as gingipains, and 16S rRNA from P. gingivalis have
all been found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. Since P. gingivalis is found in the mouth, the blood and is
known to invade non-oral tissues including the brain, then strategies to reduce P. gingivalis numbers and
activities including reducing brain inflammation, are beginning to show positive effects on outcomes associated
with AD in animal models and in the clinic.We recently discovered that small mimetics of Apolipoprotein-E (ApoE-mimetics) inhibited the growth
and killed P. gingivalis bacteria. Other groups have reported similar anti-bacterial activities of ApoE-mimetics
including our ApoE-mimetics. These anti-bacterial activities appear to correlate with anti-inflammatory
activities of ApoE-mimetics reported by us and other groups. We reported that these ApoE-mimetics extended
lifespan in mice subjected to whole body sepsis using a caecal ligation and puncture model. We also reported
that these ApoE-mimetics cross the blood brain barrier where they reduce brain inflammation in multiple
models of Alzheimer's disease.In this grant, we propose to preferentially kill P. gingivalis by a unique strategy. This strategy involves a
targeting ligand that specifically binds to a unique cell surface protein on P. gingivalis that, when conjugated
with our anti-bacterial ApoE-mimetics, provides a “targeted” anti-bacterial agent. We refer to the “P. gingivalis
targeting motif” as a “gingi-tif” and the conjugation with an ApoE-mimetic with as an “ApoE-gingitif”. As proof-
of-principle, we now show that the ApoE-gingitif known as RGN2002 retains bacterial killing activity and
preferentially targets P. gingivalis killing over killing of commensal bacteria (Figure 9 and Table 2). We will
synthesize additional ApoE-gingitif and gingitif-ApoE conjugates and use them to measure the minimum
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against P. gingivalis. We will also use these ApoE-gingitif and gingitif-ApoE
conjugates to measure MICs against a non-pathogenic commensal bacteria also found in the mouth. The ratio
of the MICs for killing pathogenic P. gingivalis versus non-pathogenic commensal bacteria will provide a
quantitation of the preferential killing of P. gingivalis, which we call a “Preference Ratio.” (Table 2). Once our in
vitro screen has selected an appropriate ApoE-gingitif or gingitif-ApoE conjugate, then we will test these
conjugates in a whole mouse model of P. gingivalis infection. Since oral delivery of P. gingivalis resulted in
increased amyloid beta peptide 1-42, increased phosphorylated-tau and increased cytokines, which are all
found in Alzheimer's patient's brains, we will measure these products in the brains of P. gingivalis infected
mice with and without ApoE-gingitif or gingitif-ApoE conjugate treatment. These results will permit us to
determine the efficacy of this targeted “ApoE-gingitif-strategy” to reduce brain inflammation and pathology
associated with AD and P. gingivalis infections.",  ,,,,MICHAEL P VITEK,,(919) 656-7835,mikevitek@regennova.com,WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY,  ,

Steel is ubiquitous in our lives, from bridges and skyscrapers to cars and consumer goods. Yet, producing steel often comes with a long flow sheet, high cost, waste, and pollution. The proposed innovative process uses hydrogen (H2) to directly reduce SPIOP in a high-temperature hydrogen reduction electric furnace to produce steel. The raw iron ore is first ground to a fine target size range (~0-0.076mm) to dissociate iron ore particles from gangue/impure particles such as quartz and rocks. The dissociated iron ore particles are then purified using the company’s high-intensity iron separation technologies. The purified iron ore concentrate is greater than99.0% purity. The hydrogen reduction process and direct reduced iron melting process occur in the same furnace, producing a one-step crude steel manufacturing process._x000D_

This SBIR Fast-Track project will develop a novel mobile health framework for left ventricular end diastolic
pressure diagnostics and monitoring, using an innovative, non-invasive cardiac biosensor. Heart disease is the
leading cause of death for men and women accounting for more than one-third (33.6%) of all U.S. deaths. The
total costs associated with cardiovascular disease in the U.S. were estimated to be $363 billion, making it the
costliest health problem facing the nation. In addition, it occurs disproportionately among minority and health
disparity populations. For example, heart failure related deaths are 30% higher among African-Americans than
among non-Hispanic whites. Left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) is a reflection of ventricular
compliance and intravascular volume and pressure; it relates both acutely and chronically to clinical conditions
that affect ventricular performance. LVEDP is elevated in the setting of heart failure (HF), and its measurement
is used in the management of HF. Overall cardiac health can be significantly improved by proper triage at the
primary care level by determination of the LVEDP without requiring a 2-D echo-cardiogram or left heart
catherization. It will provide health care professionals with technology to guide diagnostic and facilitate easy
home-based management by patients. Using everyday smartphones makes it even more accessible and
readily available without adding high costs. As the technology being developed does not require skilled
operators or specially trained physicians, it will allow healthcare providers to assess LVEDP within their normal
medical training. Through the course of this project we will validate this revolutionary mobile health framework
that enables measurement of LVEDP using everyday smartphones. The scope of the science proposed in this
project is to complete development of the diagnostic framework using our specially engineered sensor system
combined with the novel algorithm technology to be accessed via a smartphone for a portable and cost-
effective solution. Resource-poor communities across the globe lack access to quality healthcare arising from
shortages in medical expertise and poor availability of expensive medical diagnostic devices. In recent years,
mobile phones have become increasingly advanced and ubiquitous. The mobile framework developed through
this project is a tremendous opportunity to provide low-cost diagnostics to under-served populations. The
benefit of this pioneering work is the development of an easy-to-use solution that can measure ventricular
compliance, and thus enable improved screening during routine annual checkups, doctor visits, at community
medical screenings, classes, and health fairs leading to healthier communities. It will make measuring LVEDP
as routine as measuring blood pressure. In Phase II, we will continue validation of the device through user-
trials and seek FDA 510(k) clearance for commercialization. Followed by commercialization in the Florida and
nationwide, based on the partnerships and joint collaborations established to help create a commercially
successful product.",  ,,,,KAUSTUBH  KALE,,(954) 399-3335,kaustubh@aventusoft.com,,  ,

A significant number (~30-50%) of liver cancers have no curative treatments due to their proximity to critical
anatomy. Minimally invasive thermal ablation is a promising treatment for these untreatable solid tumors. If
delivered precisely, ablations offer the treatment efficacy of traditional surgery with lower patient risk,
clinician time, and overall cost. Existing ablation technology, however, does not offer the necessary precision.
Ablation tools do not provide feedback on (1) whether or not the probe has been accurately placed within the
tumor, (2) if the tumor has been completely destroyed, or (3) if surrounding healthy tissue has been left
intact. Because of this lack of precision and feedback, ablation cannot currently be used to treat tumors near
critical anatomy.
A proposed solution to these currently untreatable cancers is an ultraprecise ablation needle, embedded with
high-resolution ultrasound sensors at its tip. These sensors will provide multiple benefits: aiding the clinician
in placing the device correctly by imaging the tumor relative to the needle, delivering the treatment energy to
a precise location through focusing, and providing real-time monitoring of the procedure by detecting the
thermal changes in tissue-all without the need for a large imaging system. This innovation will allow
surgeons to complete an ablation with the required precision to treat even the most difficult-to-reach cancers.
This Phase 1 SBIR proposal will demonstrate the capabilities of small-scale ultrasound transducers to
precisely control ablations near critical anatomical structures (e.g., arteries) in an in vivo porcine model
through three specific aims: (1) optimization of previously developed ultrasound-based ablation zone
estimation in ex vivo liver tissue using deep learning and physics-based simulations, (2) ablation zone
estimation in an in vivo porcine liver model, and (3) demonstration of in vivo closed-loop ablation zone
control near critical anatomy (artery in liver). Completion of this phase will demonstrate the key technology
in a pilot animal study, where Phase 2 work would address critical development milestones to
commercialization for an anticipated Class 2 device (approval via de nova regulatory pathway).",  ,,,,ALIREZA  MASHAL,,(608) 332-9135,al@currentsurgical.com,,  ,

Defined as cessation of breathing for 20 seconds or longer or a shorter pause accompanied by hypoxemia, AOP is a major morbidity among preterm infants and a significant healthcare burden. AOP affects 70% of all early preterm births (lt34 weeks gestational age) and nearly all at ≤ 28 weeks’ gestation. In the United States in 2020, the total annual direct costs associated with AOP exceeded $12 billion. While there is no consensus for treating AOP, common interventions include positional techniques, caffeine citrate, manual tactile stimulation, and supplemental oxygen for hypoxemia. Caffeine citrate is the first line of therapy as it decreases apneic episodes and reduces the need for assisted ventilation. At recommended doses, caffeine has been proven safe and effective. However, in the sole trial supporting its FDA clearance, a majority of newborns treated with caffeine citrate continued to experience apnea events. In 2015, a clinical study using a stochastic vibrotactile stimulation (SVS) investigational device reported a 50% reduction in the number of apnea events. Prapela exclusively licensed the SVS technology of the investigational device and has demonstrated technical feasibility replicating the clinically critical stimulation in prototype incubator pads. The broad objective of this SBIR Fast-Track application is to generate the data and documentation necessary for FDA marketing clearance of a novel device to reduce apnea events in preterm newborns. To accomplish this objective, Prapela proposes four Specific Aims: 1) complete development of the SVS incubator pad, 2) demonstrate the safety of the device, 3) determine the clinical efficacy of the SVS incubator pad as an adjunctive therapy to concurrent pharmacological treatment in newborns with AOP, and 4) document the benefit-risk assessment of the device from clinicians caring for AOP patients. Efficacy will be established through a masked, randomized clinical trial with newborns of lt33 weeks gestational age, with postmenstrual age (PMA) of lt38 weeks at the time of enrollment. The control group will receive standard therapy only with caffeine citrate and respiratory support and an inert SVS device, while the intervention group will receive standard therapy concurrent with the Prapela SVS device. The primary outcome measure will be the mean number of apnea events in the three days after study entry, with a reduction in apnea events of 30% or more considered clinically significant.

Problem Despite the use of aggressive surgery, combination chemotherapy and immunotherapy, a major limitation in the control of primary and metastatic non-small cell pulmonary tumors with the use of the systemic administration of drugs is the low drug concentration in the lungs due to blood volume dilution and metabolism. There is a critical unmet medical need to develop new strategies to improve patient treatment outcomes. Innovation In contrast to systemic delivery of chemotherapy, inhalation delivers a chemotherapeutic drug directly to tumor tissues in the lung thereby enhancing its efficacy and safety due to increased local drug concentration in the lung, decreased systemic drug levels in the circulation, and decreased systemic toxicity. Gap Preliminary pre-clinical in-vivo studies using nebulized chemotherapy drugs has demonstrated efficacy and established the feasibility of delivery via aerosol, but nebulization of toxic drugs has major drawbacks. These drawbacks include a lack of efficient peripheral airway penetration, high mouth-throat deposition, contamination of equipment, and collateral aerosol risk to medical staff. Project Objective To address these drawbacks, we are developing a new method of delivering a chemotherapeutic drug via inhalation to reach pulmonary tumors directly in order to maximize the effectiveness and safety of the aerosol treatment with a fraction of the standard dose. We will create a novel dry powder chemotherapeutic formulation containing an FDA approved chemotherapy medication for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Aims Aims of this proposal will be 1) scale-up the lead Quench EEG formulation and conduct characterization, stability, and performance studies, and 2) conduct IND-enabling toxicology studies in an established inhalation toxicology rodent model for regulatory submission. Commercial Potential Translation of this technology into a clinically beneficial inhalable chemotherapy product has the potential to significantly improve the treatment of pulmonary tumors in lung cancer patients by delivering targeted lower doses of medicine directly to the lung while minimizing systemic toxicity.",  ,,,,BRYCE  BEVERLINII,,6126669753,beverlin@quenchmedical.net,,  ,

Home modifications (HM) are associated with falls preventions, improved activities of daily living (ADLs), and emotional wellbeing. However, over 95% of existing homes in the US are not appropriate for AiP, and a preventive or proactive procurement of HMs remains an unmet need. In addition, approximately 72 million Americans will be aged 65 or older by 2030. Thus, there is an urgent need to update 100 million existing homes. However, currently, no tools provide access to standardized instructions, training, product specifications, and hardware selections to ensure accurate and efficient installations. HRV aims to address this unmet need by developing an innovative and reproducible solution for efficient, cost-effective, and quality HMs to support a preventive or proactive procurement of HMs, enabling older adults to AiP longer. In Phase I, HRV developed a prototype APP that uses site-specific inputs from a contractor or handyperson to generate customized guidance and instructions for proper specification, placement, and installation of bathroom grab bars. The APP simultaneously allows photo documentation of the installation process to verify compliance with instructions. Informed by the Phase I outcomes, including proven feasibility of the APP concept to systematize HM as well as the specific feedback provided by end-users, we aim to refine and expand our APP’s features and functionalities and rigorously validate its effectiveness as a practical job site tool. To accomplish these goals, we will pursue four specific aims: Aim 1 will provide the design criteria for a broader range of HMs critical to independent mobility (climbing stairs, moving in and out of the home) and personal hygiene (toileting and bathing) to be programmed in the APP. Aim 2 will enhance the APP usability and user experience by expanding features and functionalities critical to the user’s efficiency and productivity. A new prototype will be ready for extensive testing and validation at the end of this Aim. In Aim 3, we will develop three physical mock- ups to simulate real-life scenarios in which contractors work to complete the proposed installation. Finally, aim 4 will be a validation study assessing the APP’s ability in guiding installers to correctly install HMs irrespective of the installer’s experience. The outcome of this Aim will demonstrate APP reproducibility in enabling consistent HM solutions in real life. The product of Phase II will be an enhanced and rigorously tested, and validated commercialization-ready prototype. The data generated during Phase II will be critical to boosting customer/end- user confidence. Our ultimate goal is to improve the quality of life for millions of aging adults residing in their homes through our innovative solution.",  ,,,,LOUIS  TENENBAUM,,3019830131,louis@homesrenewed.org,,  ,

After SCI, spinal reflex function becomes abnormal, contributing to motor impairments and spasticity that affects 65-78% of people with SCI. Thus, restoring the function of spinal reflex pathways is a major therapeutic goal. Current therapies are only moderately successful; motor function often does not return to pre-injury levels. Research led by Dr. Wolpaw at the National Center for Adaptive Neurotechnologies (NCAN) and Dr. Thompson at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) has developed a novel noninvasive therapy that targets beneficial change to specific spinal reflex pathways. The patient learns, through operant conditioning, to modify the brain’s control over the pathway. This modified control gradually changes the pathway, and triggers favorable plasticity in other pathways as well. In people with SCI, spinal reflex conditioning reduces spasticity, eliminates limping, and increases walking speed. The benefits persist; and they are apparent to people in their daily lives. Clinical translation of this powerful new therapy is now impractical because the reflex conditioning system is complex and requires a highly-trained operator. To realize its therapeutic potential, reflex conditioning needs an integrated hardware/software system that can be mastered quickly and used effectively by therapists. BioCircuit Technologies has the essential hardware; NCAN and MUSC have the essential software and clinical expertise. BioCircuit has a strong record in transforming complex technology into turnkey systems. Working together, BioCircuit, NCAN, and MUSC propose to create a reflex conditioning system suitable for widespread clinical use. Phase I - Aim 1 will integrate hardware to record EMG from multiple sites and stimulate the peripheral nerve with software to control recording and stimulation and provide real-time visual feedback to the patient and results to the therapist. This new system will combine BioCircuit’s recording/stimulation platform, NCAN’s automated algorithms, and MUSC’s clinical methods. Through formal clinician usability tests, we will optimize the system and confirm its robustness and usability. Aim 2 will establish the device compliance and regulatory pathway based on FDA feedback, bring development under design and quality system control, ensure regulatory compliance, and guide the Phase II clinical study and the pathway to a future FDA 510(k) submission. Phase II - Aim 1 will validate the effectiveness of the new system in people with chronic incomplete SCI. We expect that reflex conditioning with the new system will equal or exceed that of the old system. Aim 2 will assess the impact of the new system on motor function, quality of life, and community participation. We expect that its benefits will equal or exceed those of the old system. These studies will identify metrics for a large post-Phase II study. Aim 3 will gather initial data on safety for an FDA 510(k) submission for use in SCI. This project will produce a robust clinically practical reflex conditioning system that enables this noninvasive new therapy to complement traditional therapies and enhance recovery for people with SCI and other disorders.",  ,,,,ISAAC P CLEMENTS,,7704687700,iclements@biocircuit.com,,  ,

Presently, almost all commercial low-emissivity windows severely block mobile signals from entering buildings - a serious problem in today's world that demands fast and uninterrupted mobile connectivity. The proposed low-emissivity windows can be manufactured cost-competitively and significantly reduce the costs of installing indoor cellular aids such as routers and antennas. This technology will accelerate the further adoption of low-emissivity windows to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as support the further deployment of 5G technologies._x000D_
_x000D_
This SBIR Phase I project proposes to investigate scalable manufacturing of mobile, signal transmissive, low-emissivity windows by using lithographic deposition of photoresist structures on the glass substrate prior to low-emissivity vacuum coating. The project proposes to deposit photoresist structures with non-conductive spacers on glass substrate, reducing the low-emissivity coating’s electric conductivity that prevents wireless signal passthrough. Dielectric layers will be deposited over the sidewalls to form protective layers over the low-emissivity coatings to protect against oxidative corrosion. The width of the photoresist structures will range between 2 to 5 micrometers to minimize the degradation of low-emissivity coatings to less than 2%, to maintain thermal performance. After low-emissivity coating deposition, the non-planar spacers will subsequently collapse into the photoresist layer restoring low-emissivity coatings to their original planar position thereby rendering the photoresist structure invisible to the eye. Furthermore, the team will explore additional photoresist designs to address potential lighting diffractions that may form on the finished window._x000D_

Numerous studies, both preclinical and clinical, demonstrate that CO has dual mechanisms of action including anti-sickling and anti-inflammatory processes. We have produced preclinical efficacy data in two transgenic SCD mouse models with HBI-002 similar to those reported in three studies using four different transgenic SCD mouse models and other modes of low dose CO administration, all of which demonstrate that low doses of CO are a promising approach to limiting vascular stasis, reducing hemolysis, and down-regulating inflammatory processes. In addition, proof of concept clinical efficacy studies in SCD demonstrated improvements in SCD efficacy biomarkers, and epidemiological evidence also supports the therapeutic potential of low dose CO in SCD. These studies provide compelling support for a potential beneficial role for HBI-002 in limiting SCD morbidity. The safety and tolerability of low dose CO has been demonstrated by others in 21 successfully completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies in various indications, including two Phase 1b studies in SCD patients, using a variety of forms of CO administration. Moreover, there are ongoing clinical studies with low dose CO, using various forms of CO administration, including a Phase 1 study with HBI-002. The absence of toxicity of CO at low levels of carboxy-hemoglobin (COHb) has been well defined in the literature, indicating the potential for a wide safety margin and appropriate benefit:risk ratio at the COHb levels in the studies described above, which are the target COHb levels being considered for SCD patients with HBI-002. However, barriers to chronic dosing of CO with prior therapeutic administrative approaches have prevented the development of a low dose CO therapeutic used chronically for the prevention of VOCs. To date, inhaled CO gas (iCO) and CO bound to carrier molecules such as hemoglobin (CORMs, also termed CO prodrugs) have been the modalities of choice in the majority of studies. However, these other forms of low dose CO are not expected to be viable therapeutic options for chronic dosing due to, with iCO, the risk of inadvertent exposure from the presence of compressed CO cylinders as well as difficulties in controlling dosing and, with CORMs, carrier molecule toxicity, stability, and CO release characteristics, all of which have proven to be substantial barriers to development. HBI-002, a novel oral low dose CO drug product, enables the chronic use of low dose CO in SCD and is being developed for the prevention of VOCs in SCD. The administration of a low, defined dose of CO delivered by oral HBI-002 enables the further development of low dose CO as a therapeutic while obviating the problems associated with iCO or CORMs. Preclinical studies with orally administered HBI-002 have demonstrated proof- of-concept efficacy, safety, and bioavailability. These preclinical data strongly point to efficacy in preventing vaso- occlusion in SCD. In this application, we combine the expertise of Hillhurst with its innovative technology and propose to build on compelling data to study the proof of concept efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of HBI-002 in SCD subjects.",  ,,,,EDWARD  GOMPERTS,,8184455890,jade818@charter.net,,  ,

and lethal brain cancer that represents 48% of all malignant brain tumors. Untreated, GBM is fatal within three
months, and due to its high rate of recurrence and invasive nature, the current standard of care, consisting of
safe maximal tumor resection, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, only extends survival following initial
diagnosis to one year. Invasion and proliferation, also known as Go and Grow, are defining phenotypes of GBM,
and GBM cells do only one or the other. However, blocking invasion stimulates proliferation and vice versa,
implying that an ideal therapeutic needs to block both Go and Grow simultaneously. Extensive genetic
interventions have shown that simultaneous disruption of two non-muscle myosin II (NMII) molecular motors
(NMIIA and IIB) meet these criteria. However, the translational potential of this research has been limited by the
lack of a clinically safe, CNS-penetrant NMII small molecule inhibitor. Following extensive medicinal chemistry
efforts to optimize selectivity for safety and tolerability, MT-125 was identified. MT-125 is a well-tolerated, dual
small molecule inhibitor of NMIIA and IIB with a high degree of brain penetrance, a requirement for an effective
GBM therapeutic. Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies show that MT-125 blocks the Go and Grow phenotypes
and extends survival. Due to its unique mode of action, MT-125 also synergizes with existing FDA-approved
treatments, presenting a path to a potentially curative treatment. The overarching goal of the current proposal
is to ready MT-125 for rapid entry into IND-enabling studies. This will be achieved through several activities.

Wagner,Room 105,Ann Arbor,Michigan,48103,"The broader/commercial impact of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project is to increase the productivity of manufacturing machines at low cost through software improvements, without sacrificing quality. The project is specifically motivated by 3D printing, an $11 billion and rapidly growing industry within advanced manufacturing that is critical to national security, supply chain resiliency, and economic prosperity.The adoption of 3D printing for mainstream manufacturing is often hindered by the low speed of 3D printers. A major hindrance to high-speed 3D printing is vibration, which causes loss of quality at high-speed operation. This project seeks to develop a low-cost, software-based approach for mitigating the vibration of 3D printers. A major impediment to the effectiveness of the proposed software solution is the need for accurate calibration of the changing vibration behavior of 3D printers under varying operating conditions. This project will develop a set of automatic calibration techniques to address this impediment. The software algorithms developed through this project will not only benefit 3D printing but would also apply to a wide range of advanced manufacturing machines, like machine tools and robots, whose speed and accuracy are often limited by vibration. _x000D_
_x000D_
This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project seeks to develop a suite of automatic calibration techniques to enable a proprietary vibration compensation algorithm to adapt to frequent changes in vibration behavior of 3D printers that occur in the field. To achieve this goal, three technical objectives will be pursued. The first technical objective will involve the development of a sensor-less auto calibration technique that continuously updates the calibration of 3D printers whose moving mass and vibration behavior changes as material is being deposited on the print bed. The second technical objective will focus on the development of a sensor-based, autocalibration technique that uses shallow machine learning to continuously fine-tune the calibration maps of 3D printers with onboard accelerometers. The third technical objective will involve the development of a sensor-based autocalibration-as-a-service technique primarily for 3D printers that do not have onboard accelerometers. To achieve these objectives, research is needed to overcome technical hurdles that hinder the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed auto-calibration approaches. The intellectual merit of this project is in developing science-based approaches that overcome the technical hurdles and their associated risks._x000D_

A large body of research on career navigation has studied how post-secondary education, career readiness (understanding viable career paths at graduation), and its interconnectedness are important for a growing number of first-generation, low-income, and underrepresented students. With increasing undergraduate degree program offerings in response to an evolving future of work and student-to-counselor ratios of 1: 1,800 in public colleges, career guidance, and academic navigation risk being unavailable. As a result, during the pandemic, Institutes of Higher Education (IHEs) that serve students of color and students from low-income backgrounds saw declines in enrollment that far outpaced their predominantly White peer institutions. The proposed platform intends to increase the visibility, accessibility, and discoverability of competencies to potential career and academic paths for students at IHEs. The platform envisions doing this via near-peer role models who are similar in their dimensions of self-efficacy. With more than 85 million jobs that could go unfilled by 2030, the proposed platform may help alleviate part of that shortage by widening the talent aperture._x000D_
_x000D_
The intellectual merit of this project is in the company’s patented technology of a unified, multi-dimensional, data representation model that creates a ‘competency fingerprint’ for each user. The data representation method enables better machine learning models to ‘infer’ competency from unstructured data of a student’s traditional and non-traditional learning experience, rather than degrees, majors, grade point averages (GPAs), or test scores. The platform uses a consistent, scalable, competency nomenclature for hard and soft skills gained via traditional academic and outside-of-the-classroom experiences to discover academic-career paths where the students’ learning competencies may be in demand. There is a significant technical challenge in adopting this technology for the inter/cross-disciplinary jobs of the future:such a platform requires a robust, larger data set to evaluate the relevance of matching, in a discipline-agnostic context. Reduction of this variability is the key technical risk to be overcome by the proposed research and development._x000D_

10% of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and totaling over 200,000 patients/year in the U.S. Current
treatment cost typically exceeds $70,000 per patient. Decades of clinical trials failed to identify effective
pharmacologic therapy for ARDS, while mortality remains above 30%. Thus, there is a critical, unmet clinical
need for successful pharmacologic strategies to treat ARDS. Neutrophils play an essential role in the lung
injury leading to ARDS, including that due to COVID-19, through extracellular release of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), granule constituents, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The scientific foundation
underlying our innovative therapy is that inhibition of neutrophil degranulation also prevents release of ROS
and NETs, making degranulation a therapeutic target. We generated a recombinant protein, degranin-23
(degranulation inhibitor of SNAP-23, DGN-23) containing a SNARE motif from SNAP-23 and a cell
permeability peptide. DGN-23 rapidly enters human neutrophils in vitro and in vivo, inhibits degranulation by
50% to 80%, prevents priming of ROS release, and reduces NET formation. Importantly, in vitro studies show
DGN-23 does not impair neutrophil phagocytosis, granule fusion with phagosomes, or bacterial killing within
phagosomes, and in vivo studies show that DGN-23 administration at the initiation of lung injury inhibits acute
lung injury in 3 rodent models, without obvious toxicity. Thus, in vitro and in vivo data provide strong support for
our novel therapeutic strategy that inhibition of neutrophil exocytosis attenuates lung injury leading to ARDS.
The next steps are development of manufacturing capability and quality control to move from a laboratory
grade recombinant protein to a pharmaceutical grade drug and validation of therapeutic effect without toxicity
under clinically relevant conditions. This transition will be accomplished by two Aims. Aim 1: Characterize
production characteristics and off-target/side effects of DGN-23. This aim will determine purity, presence
of bacterial contaminants, yield, reproducibility of potency, and stability in multiple production runs of DGN-23.
Cell toxicity and off target effects on circulating immune cells will be determined. Organ and cell localization of
DGN-23 will be determined in all major organs from animals undergoing experiments described in Aim 2. Aim
2: Determine therapeutic efficacy of DGN-23 under clinically relevant conditions. The ability of DGN-23
to prevent acute lung injury and improve mortality when administered at various times after the initiating injury
will be determined in a mouse model of H1N1 influenza virus-induced acute lung injury. Improved survival and
improved blood oxygenation will serve as outcomes to proceed with development. At the conclusion of this
work, this Phase 1 project will have identified a drug candidate with an optimal combination of efficacy, yield,
stability, and potency to advance to advanced pre-clinical studies in a Phase 2 project.",  ,,,,KENNETH R MCLEISH,,(502) 797-4162,dgn.kmcleish@gmail.com,,  ,

Improving adherence is a persistent challenge with youth experiencing chronic health conditions, especially among adolescent transplant recipients. Adolescent organ transplant recipients experience unique challenges remaining adherent to the complex posttransplant regimen, with rates of nonadherence as high as 40% to 60%. In this population, medication nonadherence remains a primary cause of late acute rejection (LAR) episodes, increased number of hospitalizations, graft failure, and patient mortality. A mobile health application developed by emocha Health Inc. facilitates asynchronous mobile video directly observed therapy (DOT) intervention, empowering users to track dose-by-dose medication adherence. The intervention has been successfully implemented with adolescent HT patients at University of Florida (UF) Health, wherein patients and their caregivers reported high levels of intervention acceptability. In the proposed SBIR Direct to Phase II (R44) project, we will examine several newly implemented technological and practical innovations within emocha’s DOT app (and intervention). In this randomized controlled trial, we will assign adolescent HT recipients to either the 12-week DOT intervention or to a control group involving enhanced goal-setting sessions with transplant team members. Specifically, we seek to advance the DOT approach to allow for greater patient engagement and interaction through novel video feedback and simplify delivery of the intervention through centralized medication and dosing review at a single transplant center for the entire study population: three pediatric HT centers representing a significant proportion of pediatric HT patients in the state of Florida. Together with emocha, our small business partner, the proposed study will examine differences in patient- and caregiver-reported measures, factors related to scalability and potential of translation of the DOT intervention into routine clinical care, and long-term health and adherence patient outcomes. This study will expand on recent results from pilot research using the emocha DOT intervention with adolescent HT recipients. Implementing the DOT intervention with pediatric HT recipients with improved video feedback capabilities and use of centralized adherence and participant monitoring are both programmatic innovations. Our long-term goals are to provide evidence-based tools and support for pediatric HT recipients while improving their medication-taking behaviors and to reduce barriers to delivery of DOT for pediatric solid organ transplant teams. Such efforts are central to their care, the treatment efforts of transplant teams, and to the research priorities of NHLBI.",  ,,,,SEBASTIAN  SEIGUER,,4108040059,sseiguer@emocha.com,,  ,

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a rare and deadly cancer. First line treatment for GBM includes maximal
surgical resection with radiotherapy administered post-surgery, and concomitant administration of adjuvant
temozolomide. Tumor recurrence is nearly inevitable due to the microscopic, infiltrating cells that are found
centimeters from the margin of visible tumor mass. There is currently no effective standard of care for recurrent
(rGBM) and this highly aggressive disease leads to death within 15 months after diagnosis and has a 5-year
survival rate of lt10%. Therefore, there is a clear and significant clinical need for better therapies for rGBM. To
address this unmet need, SonALAsense is developing sonodynamic therapy (SDT), a non-invasive drug-device
combination, to treat rGBM. SDT uses an MRI-Guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) device in combination
with a drug called 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). Three independent laboratories have demonstrated the safety
and efficacy of ALA SDT in animal glioma models where the animals were dosed first with ALA and then treated
with MRgFUS at energies that do not raise brain temperature. MRgFUS activated Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a
metabolite of ALA, created singlet oxygen that induced necrosis and apoptosis in the glioma in a process similar
to photodynamic therapy. Activation of PpIX non-invasively caused regression of the gliomas and extended
survival. A first-in-human Phase 0/1 clinical trial in rGBM showed that ALA SDT was well-tolerated and not
associated with off-target cellular or radiographic effects and provided direct evidence of reactive oxygen species
formation and targeted tumor cell death in rGBM only 4 days after treatment. These Phase 0/1 data obtained to
date may be interpreted as the successful translation of ALA SDT-treated animal glioma model effects to human
rGBM patients. Due to its non-invasive nature, ALA SDT has the unique opportunity to be used multiple times
to extend survival. Therefore, a Phase 2 clinical trial will be conducted at 6 clinical trial sites to determine
the optimal Phase 2 dosing and schedule to comprehensively evaluate efficacy. This Direct to Phase II project
will focus on one clinical trial site at the Ivy Brain Tumor Center. This will be accomplished through the
execution of 3 Aims. In Aim 1, we will enroll single patient cohorts to determine maximum tolerated dose and
energy for a single dose schedule. In Aim 2, we will determine the recommended schedule by escalating the
dosing schedule to 2 then 3 treatments. In Aim 3, we will use the dosing and treatment schedule identified
in Aims 1 and 2 to evaluate preliminary efficacy and follow patients weekly in month 1, biweekly in month 2,
and monthly thereafter. Completion of this clinical trial will address FDA guidance in our pre-IND meeting and
the safety and clinical data from this Phase 2 trial will provide the basis for an end of Phase 2 meeting with the
FDA to establish criteria for the approval of ALA SDT as an effective treatment for rGBM. Ultimately,
SonALAsense’s ALA SDT combination therapy has great potential to positively impact rGBM patients and their
families by improving outcomes.",  ,,,,STUART  MARCUS,,(914) 649-3212,stuart@sonalasense.com,,  ,

The Specific Aim of this Phase I TTR proposal is to test the feasibility of our siRNA drug to ameliorate the
pathology and progression of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). Alcohol consumption remains a leading
cause of hepatic pathology worldwide and is one of the greatest sources of preventable morbidity and
mortality. In the U.S., alcohol abuse impacts over 10 million individuals and is a major healthcare burden. The
underlying cause of ALD is multi-factorial, including obesity, oxidative stress, and inflammation, all of which
contribute the pathological progression from steatosis to steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and fibrosis.
Effective therapeutic modalities targeting ALD remain critically absent. Targeting the underlying pathological
mechanisms leading to alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis may prevent the cascade of events inducing
inflammation and irreversible liver damage. Alcohol-induced mitochondrial dysfunction is a key driver of
steatosis and related metabolic defects leading to severe ALD. We propose the novel approach of treating ALD
by safely increasing mitochondrial metabolism in the liver and will test this in acute and chronic models of ALD.
Lipids are transported to the liver where they are metabolized in mitochondria through cytosolic beta-oxidation,
which is coupled through the citric acid cycle to the electron transport chain (ETC) and mitochondrial
respiration. NADH and FADH2, are the two main products from beta-oxidation that feed into the ETC (NADH is
substrate for Complex I and FADH2 for Complex II), therefore increasing ETC activity will increase beta-
oxidation. Enhancing hepatic ETC activity could therefore speed up the degradation of fatty acids, preventing
steatosis. A key endogenous negative regulator of the ETC is the MCJ protein (MCJ/DnaJC15 or Methylation-
Controlled J protein). MCJ is a mitochondrial protein that negatively regulates ETC metabolism by binding to
complex I. Our work demonstrates that removal of MCJ appears to be safe and increases mitochondrial
respiration without inducing oxidative stress. We have developed a GalNAc (N-acetylgalactosamine) linked
siRNA drug that is specific to MCJ. Conjugation to GalNAc directs the siRNA to liver hepatocytes and provides
a direct route targeting ALD. Validating an siRNA approach to treating liver disease, two GalNAc linked siRNA
drugs are approved by the FDA for treatment of liver diseases (Patisiran, lipid-nanoparticle formulated siRNA
and Givosiran, GalNAc-conjugated siRNA).
We have developed a lead therapeutic, GalNAc linked siRNA specific to MCJ (MITO-1041) and validated our
siRNA approach to reducing steatosis and fibrosis in liver using many mouse models of fatty liver disease.
MITO-1041 is proprietary and specific for human, primate, and mouse MCJ, allowing for rapid IND enabling
studies when the time comes. However, we have not yet tested MITO-1041 in mouse models of ALD.
Therefore, our Specific Aim of this project is to test the feasibility of using a hepatic MCJ targeted siRNA
(MITO-1041) to ameliorate alcohol-induced steatosis and associated pathologies.",  ,,,,KRISTOFER S FRITZ,,(303) 724-7932,kristofer.fritz@cuanschutz.edu,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,  ,

These issues have increased significance due to the burgeoning use of FBS in cell research and therapy development. FBS has been used for over a century to culture cells, but with the need to define culture conditions for efficient manufacturing, along with modern approaches to control delivery of key molecules, many of the problems associated with FBS use can now be alleviated. The need to reduce animal products is critically important, as is the need to use human growth factors to optimize human cell growth. The company StemCultures specializes in controlling the growth factor (GF) component of cell culture media. Our goal is to replace FBS GFs with a bioengineered DISCTM (Defined Insert for Sustainable Culture) device providing controlled-release human recombinant GFs. The advanced cell manufacturing DISCTM device will address concerns about FBS and improve the reproducibility of cell production. In this application we will develop a DISCTM device for growth of human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Human RPE was selected as a testbed for FBS replacement as these cells are a vanguard for stem cell replacement therapy in the US, Europe and Asia. A barrier to reducing FBS use is the lack of knowledge about the GF content of FBS that is critical for growth of the RPE cell product. We will measure levels of FBS GFs that stimulate human RPE cell proliferation. Selected recombinant human GFs will be encapsulated in controlled- release GF microbeads that provide a standardized growth signal over time, to replace the variable levels of bovine GFs provided by FBS with defined levels of native human recombinant GFs. The GF microbeads will be assessed in a factorial design experiment to identify microbead combinations that support RPE cell growth at a reduced level of FBS. The microbead combination that supports RPE cell growth without FBS or at the lowest level of FBS will be packaged in a Defined Insert for Sustainable Culture (DISCTM) device to simplify RPE cell manufacture. The DISCTM will be manufactured as a commercial product marketed to reduce FBS dependence of the commercially important RPE cells. Future work will apply the microbead/DISCTM platform strategy to reduce FBS dependence of other cell types. The company StemCultures (SCL) routinely manufactures microbeads and DISCsTM for sustained release of GFs in culture media and the co-located Neural Stem Cell Institute (NSCI) has extensive RPE cell culture expertise.

Electronic waste is approximately 50 million tons/year with less than 18% being recycled globally. Currently, disposable sensors are used to prevent food waste, yet these sensors contribute to the electronic waste problem. The proposed printed, biodegradable sensors will enhance scientific and technological understanding to move from disposable to on-demand biodegradable sensors. The market opportunity addressed by the proposed technology is over $300 billion in the food supply chain and even larger in the broader perishable markets. The technological shift to printed, biodegradable sensors will provide a competitive advantage compared to other companies that are using disposable or semi-recyclable materials. _x000D_

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project involves the development of carbon-based, printable, electronic materials to produce a biodegradable sensing platform for measuring temperature and humidity. The proliferation of electronic sensors continues to provide access to transformative data, improving health, the environment, and transportation. However, resultant electronic sensor waste is a critical concern that precludes use for certain applications. This project will use graphene for conducting, carbon nanotubes for semiconducting, and crystalline nanocellulose for insulating inks that can be printed into temperature and humidity sensors on a thin film of cellulose (i.e., paper). Technical obstacles include the co-integration of these all-carbon inks, realization of target electrical properties, and yield of functional sensors. The goals of this project include: (1) the formulation of nanomaterial inks for their co-printing onto biodegradable substrates; (2) the development of aerosol jet printing processes; and (3) the demonstration of temperature and humidity sensors from the printed carbon-based nanomaterials. To achieve these goals, innovations in the formulation of these carbon-based inks will be required, along with the design of sensor configurations that yield reliable temperature and humidity measurements. More than a dozen distinct sensor designs will be explored, and iterative tuning of ink and sensor designs will take place._x000D_

Unfortunately, a pharmacologic therapy for cancer-induced muscle atrophy does not exist. Thus, cancer-induced skeletal muscle atrophy represents a highly significant unmet medical need with broad relevance to cancer patients. A major goal of Emmyon, Inc. is to discover and develop a pharmacologic therapy for cancer-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. To that end, we recently discovered a natural compound that significantly reduces cancer-induced muscle atrophy in five well-established and distinct in vivo mouse models of cancer. We then used that natural compound as a lead in medicinal chemistry program and discovered and patented a confidential and proprietary chemical derivative (EMMY1-06) that appears to be significantly more potent and more efficacious than the lead compound in at least two distinct mouse models of cancer-induced muscle atrophy. In this Phase II SBIR proposal, we seek to continue this exciting work by advancing the development of EMMY1-06 and related molecules as pharmaceuticals for cancer-induced skeletal muscle atrophy. Specifically, we will further investigate EMMY1-06's safety, efficacy, and mechanisms of action in several distinct and complementary mouse models of cancer-induced muscle atrophy that involve multiple tumor types, sexes, and ages; these studies will significantly advance EMMY1-06 towards clinical development and commercialization in SBIR Phase III. In parallel to our detailed studies of EMMY1-06, we will also design, synthesize, and characterize novel compounds that are structurally related to EMMY1-06, seeking to discover additional compounds with pharmacologic properties that are similar to or perhaps even better than those of EMMY1-06 in preclinical models of cancer-induced muscle atrophy. Together, these studies will rigorously advance the scientific understanding and commercial development of a highly promising new class of pharmaceutical agents. Through this work, we hope to ultimately discover and develop a new pharmacologic therapy that could broadly improve clinical outcomes for millions of patients who suffer from cancer.",  ,,,,SCOTT M EBERT,,7018669322,scott-ebert@emmyon.com,,  ,

With over 12,000 MRI scanners in the U.S. and estimates that $434,000 are lost per scanner each year, motion in MRIs is costing our health care system approximately $4B yearly. Our FDA-cleared software solution Framewise Integrated Real- Time MRI Monitoring (FIRMM) mitigates data lost due to motion. However, the majority of paying customers so far are academic neuroimaging research centers; in order to ensure the commercial success of FIRMM, we need to expand the customer base to clinical institutions. The goal of this CRP application is to fill gaps in FIRMM clinical commercialization sales by partnering with Siemens and building functionality to streamline clinical use of FIRMM and FIRMM-pix.  Leading hospitals have expressed enthusiasm to use FIRMM for clinical care; however, two main barriers to clinical adoption remain: a reduction in technician critical decision making and a seamless integration into existing clinical workflows. Both of these barriers can be overcome via Siemens’ Access-I, which provides an FDA approved licensing and authentication scheme to enable secure and direct operation of Siemens systems from any 3rd party vendor device. Pairing the FIRMM tablet with Siemens' Access-I module will allow for the FIRMM tablet to re-start a scan automatically when the quality is low via a direct interaction with the clinical scanner, thus saving time, easing workflows, and standardizing decision making for technicians. Integrating the FIRMM tablet with Siemens' Access-I will lead to a more seamless integration into existing workflows; thus reducing the disruption to existing complex clinical workflows.  In addition, integrating the FIRMM tablet with Siemens' Access-I module will facilitate the wide-spread adoption of FIRMM(-pix) in the clinical market by obtaining widespread visibility via co-marketing with Siemens Healthineers and their catalog. Importantly, this partnership with Siemens is planned only as an initial step to establishing clinical commercialization sales. Although Siemens is the leading MRI manufacturer, GE and Philips combine with Siemens to account for almost 90% of the MRI market.

This phase 1 SBIR project proposes development of a
new type of drug to improve the treatment of cancer. This new approach offers potential in many
forms of the disease, including breast cancer, which is second only to cancer of the lung in
terms of mortality. In particular, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is very challenging to treat
as there are fewer therapeutic options compared to other forms of breast cancer. Recent
additions to the oncology armamentarium include immunotherapies, such as immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICBi) targeting PD-1, PD-L1 or CTLA4, which offer great promise but still
only benefit a minority of TNBC patients. Acetyl CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) is a
nucleocytoplasmic enzyme that is involved in the conversion of acetate to acetyl CoA for use as
a substrate for fatty acid biosynthesis and for acetylation of nuclear proteins. ACSS2 is
commonly upregulated in tumor cells and high expression predicts poor outcomes in multiple
cancer types including TNBC. Tumor cells use acetate derived from the gut microbiome as a
substrate to support their ongoing proliferation and metabolic needs. In contrast, the related
enzymes ACSS1 and ACSS3 are both mitochondrially located and thereby regulate a different
pool of Acetyl CoA from ACSS2 and are rarely upregulated in cancer. Consistent with its
association with human disease outcomes, genetic deletion of ACSS2 impairs tumor growth in
tumor models in animals and small molecule inhibitors of ACSS2 provide beneficial effects in
mouse models, including TNBC models that are resistant to ICBi. The ACSS2 knockout mouse
has a normal phenotype suggesting that inhibition of this enzyme is likely to have a good
safety/tolerability profile. This SBIR project will explore the potential of ACSS2 inhibitors alone
and in combination with other therapeutic mechanisms in models of TNBC and will further the
development of a proprietary series of ACSS2 inhibitors towards the aim of an orally available
drug candidate suitable for clinical development. If successful we hope to significantly improve
the therapeutic options for TNBC patients, impacting directly on improved survival and quality of
life. In addition, we believe that a well-tolerated ACSS2 inhibitor drug will impact therapeutic
outcomes in many more cancer types in addition to TNBC.",  ,,,,MICHAEL A TONES,,(617) 417-6253,mike.tones@cadrebioscience.com,,  ,

Currently, the limited range and payloads of small electric aircraft make them economically unviable on most routes.Increased aerodynamic efficiency is required for longer range. The circulation control technology being developed generates extremely high lift only when needed (takeoff and landing), but unlike other propulsion-based approaches aimed at the same effect, it is low cost and allows for a smaller and more efficient wing without any mass or performance drawbacks for the cruise portion of flight where range is needed. More rapid adoption of electric aircraft will enhance US leadership in this nascent field, facilitate the use of the country’s 5000 small, regional airports for transformative, quiet, accessible, electric air mobility, and become a new area of economic growth in underserved parts of the country. Moreover, decarbonization is an urgent challenge in aviation, with the industry being among the least able to electrify. Radical new aerodynamic approaches and configurations must be adopted, such as those which the proposed technology will enable, to reach a true net zero future for air transportation._x000D_
_x000D_
This project involves research and development of novel aerodynamic circulation control applied to the wings of electric planes to generate extremely high lift. The technology introduces a high-energy narrow jet of air over control surfaces like flaps, allowing for much higher deflections and potentially tripling the lift of a wing at takeoff and landing. Previously deemed too risky and expensive for commercial application by industry based on earlier concepts fueled by combustion engines and complex plumbing, this innovation simplifies the physical implementation in a way that is only now possible with the latest electric aircraft architectures. This project develops a combination of high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations and physical aerodynamic testing to uncover the fundamental turbulent flow characteristics that must be produced to ensure that maximum wing lift coefficients of 4 to 5 can be achieved reliably, particularly in off-design conditions. Detailed performance modeling will establish benchmarks of existing vs. modified performance to include circulation control and then apply this data to an entirely new type of maximum efficiency wing that can become a new industry standard._x000D_

biomaterial, Fractomer®, as an effective, low-cost skin grafting support matrix for the treatment of severe burn
wounds. Burns are most successfully treated by surgical excision followed by skin grafting; however many
patients with severe damage do not have sufficient healthy skin to support autograft procedures. To address this
need, biomaterial matrices, such as Integra Wound Matrix®, have been developed which reduce infection,
facilitate vascularization, and support regeneration of dermis tissue when applied to burn wounds. The current
market for dermal replacement, valued at over $7 billion, is dominated by animal-derived collagen due to well
established processes for isolating collagen from tissue and historical precedent for safety. However, due to the
cost of harvest from animals, they are notoriously expensive, with a single 40 cm2 sheet of Integra costing the
patient ~$10k. In addition, collagen cannot replicate the elasticity of natural skin, with elastin, not collagen,
providing skin with its resilient and pliable properties. As elastin production all but halts in adulthood, contraction
due to lack of elastin leads to scaring in newly developed skin. As a result, at least one third of burn treatments
using these materials require surgical revision. inSoma’s Fractomer® biomaterial is made from recombinant
elastin-mimetic proteins and represents an ideal substrate for the production of new skin grafting matrices which
better replicate the unique biomechanical properties of skin. The material has been shown to support in vivo
cellular infiltration, organized collagen deposition, vascularization, and biocompatibility during in vivo testing in
both murine and porcine models and, due to its temperature-sensitive phase transition properties, can be readily
molded into virtually any form including skin-like sheets. During the Phase I program proposed here, the company
will continue optimizing Fractomer sheet structure and formation methods to produce a material which supports
dermal regeneration through vascularization, cellular infiltration, and organized collagen deposition. A porcine
model of burn wounds will be used to compare Fractomer to Integra Wound Matrix®, the current gold standard
in skin grafting support matrices. The expected improvement in graft outcomes (e.g., fewer contractions and no
outright rejections) by employing the elastin-based Fractomer graft material represents a highly disruptive
product to the current dermal repair matrix market.",  ,,,,STEFAN  ROBERTS,,(901) 827-4757,stefan.roberts@insomabio.com,,  ,

second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Multilevel barriers explain why so many Americans
fail to receive routine CRC screening. Patients report a lack of knowledge about the need for screening or their
screening options, and many view screening as messy, uncomfortable, or embarrassing. Busy clinicians report
a lack of time to deliver preventive care, and many clinicians only discuss colonoscopy. Lastly, healthcare
systems lack strategies to reach out to patients independent of a scheduled medical visit. Disruptions caused
by COVID19 also have led to a decrease in the use of preventive services. To address these multilevel
barriers, our team has developed and tested a tablet-based digital health navigator for colorectal cancer
screening called mPATH™ (mobile Patient Technology for Health). mPATH™ determines if patients are due
for CRC screening, educates them about their options, and lets them request a screening test directly via the
program. In a randomized controlled trial conducted in primary care practices, mPATH™ doubled the
proportion of patients who completed CRC screening and had excellent usability ratings. However, we have
learned that our tablet-based model of mPATH™ is difficult to scale as it requires on-site training and changes
to workflows. The goal of this Fast Track STTR proposal is to develop and test a cloud-based version of
mPATH™ that patients can use at home independent of a scheduled medical visit. Patients will access
mPATH™ on their own devices using a hyperlink sent via text message or patient portal. The cloud version of
mPATH™ will have the proven effective content of the tablet version, including the ability to request a
screening test directly via the program. mPATH™ will then share this information with the patient’s healthcare
organization so screening can be arranged. This cloud-based version will be highly scalable, have broad
reach, and be easy to support, making it a commercially viable product. To accomplish this goal, the work of
this proposal will: (1) create a culturally appropriate and engaging cloud-based version of mPATH™ by
leveraging input from community members, an expert Scientific Advisory Committee, and feedback from users;
(2) determine the feasibility of the cloud-based mPATH™-CRC web app in a highly pragmatic pilot trial
conducted in a large health system; (3) test the reach and effectiveness of the mPATH™ web app in two
different healthcare settings: a large health system, and an Accountable Care Organization that includes rural
Federally Qualified Health Centers; and (4) determine the value generated by mPATH™ in each healthcare
setting. This Fast Track STTR will provide information that is critical to mPATH™’s future commercialization by
demonstrating its reach into diverse populations, its effectiveness in increasing screening, and the value it
generates to potential future customers. If successful, mPATH™ will fill a critical need for a commercially
available, easily scalable solution for colorectal cancer screening and potentially other preventive services.",  ,,,,DAVID P MILLER,,(336) 713-5218,dmiller@wakehealth.edu,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,  ,

including nearby cells, proteins, and antibodies. Membranes of healthy cells are often modified in diseased states,
providing an external means to distinguish between morphologically similar cells. Often, diseased cells display
modified carbohydrates and glycans on their cell membranes. Recent developments in enzyme-mediated cell
surface engineering provide promising routes for labeling these modifications in different cell types. The approach
known as chemoenzymatic glycan labeling combines glycosyltransferases and unnatural nucleotide sugar donors
equipped with chemical tags to directly label specific surface glycans within biological samples. Recently, this
single step labelling approach has been successfully used with fucosyltransferase and GDP-fucose equipped with
biotin tags. Compared with other genetic and metabolic techniques, this method of labeling living cells is a more
direct, simpler procedure with a faster turnover cycle. It has also been shown to be generally applicable to murine
tumor models, and thus has a high potential for transfer to a clinical setting. While published reports have focused
on a low number of GDP-fucose labels, the high potential of this method is limited only by the availability of
nucleotide sugar labels paired with acceptable glycosyltransferases. In order to accelerate medical advances based
on cellular interactions, there is an urgent need to expand the availability of nucleotide sugar labels and transferases
that can be used by this method.The goal of our Phase I project is to meet this need and provide non-expert users with a platform for
labeling glycans on the membranes of their choice cells. Meeting this goal will expand the availability of
glycoengineering reagents and methods beyond published studies. In Aim 1, we will create 12 new nucleotide sugar
derivatives with labels. Derivatives will be based on successful studies of GDP-fucose, and expanded to CMP-sialic
acid. Nucleotide sugars will be modified through click-chemistry with a fluorescent dye, biotin, or photoprobe
label. In Aim 2, we will screen and optimize glycosyltransferases capable of attaching labeled nucleotide sugars to
glycan substrates and cell surfaces. We will advance 10 kits that combine the most effective combinations of label
and transferase, along with standard operating procedures and conditions that are accessible to end users. Users
may then label membranes with fluorescent tags for cell surface imaging, biotin for cell selection, or photoprobes
for crosslinking. Data will support Phase II efforts to compare this method to existing technologies and probe

As software complexity and size grows, the challenge to ensure compliance grows along with it. Modern computer software is a complex stack of interacting, related, but ultimately distinct code written by numerous developers at different times. This forms a complex system of systems, and for mission- and safety-critical code, all potential code interactions, intended or otherwise, must be considered. One present challenge is ensuring that developers follow code standards and produce less defects along the way. When an agency has specific and unique code standards, there are no automated tools available to compare code written for that agency with its code standards. Nor is there an available tool which can be configured to look for compliance with custom code standards. Automation code scanning tools do exist but are ill suited to an agency’s specific compliance checking, being focused on failure mode and vulnerability analysis, such as in software assurance, or on formatting and style checking. Noetic believes that to improve the resilience of mission-critical software, complex automated quality checks must become continuous, and they must empower the developer to write compliant code earlier in the process. Doing so requires building a programmatic understanding of the context of any given block of code, identifying all applicable standards that apply, and continuously checking the code for compliance with applicable standards. The best way to achieve these goals is by closely integrating the scanning solution with the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and build systems used by the agency. This integration allows engaging with the user, extracting important context, and iterating and tailoring the detection systems to the specific code base and developer in question. To this end, Noetic proposes the creation of Integrated Development Environment Artificial Learning (IDEAL).

Compotech and the Advanced Structures and Composites Center (ASCC) at the University of Maine (UMaine) are partnering on this SBIR to create a winning team that combines Compotech’s years of experience designing military shelters with ASCC’s latest bio-based additive manufacturing (AM) technology. UMaine's talented team of engineers and scientists has been researching bio-based composite materials for over 20 years and recently applied this technology to large scale AM. The UMaine team has successfully manufactured a vehicle mounted military shelter for the US Army, a logistics vessel for the US Marines, and an energy efficient bio-based home for the Department of Energy.  UMaine was selected as Compotech’s AM partner based on their extensive experience with bio-based materials along with their capability to design, manufacture, and test large additive structures. The goal is to advance AM materials and processes, along with innovative process-specific shelter designs, to facilitate 3D printing on site using locally derived, sustainable materials. Compotech’s team will print and test near-continuous full-scale beams, columns, and panels using the proven bio-based material produced using the ASCC’s BAAM printer. The BAAM printer rapidly deposits material at a rate of up to 100 lb/hr.  Producing components with the BAAM printer eliminates the need for expensive tooling to produce a shelter. The technology developed in this SBIR has the potential to revolutionize panelized shelter production and it will change how the military designs future shelters.",Justine A Yu,Research Architect,(217) 373-4526,justine.a.yu@usace.army.mil,Jacob  Marquis,,(207) 620-0419,jmarquis@compotechinc.com,,  ,

However this value-added produce is prone to significant microbialrisks leading to an alarming number of recalls in recent years. Since post-harvest washing is criticalfor mitigating this problem several produce processors have encouraged us to develop a moreeffective and convenient disinfectant that can be approved by the FDA for safe direct food contactand no-rinse applications.With the assistance of Rutgers University we evaluated several ideas to develop new disinfectantsto meet the needs of the produce industry. Consequently we identified a promising idea ofdeveloping an innovative food-grade disinfectant by stabilizing H O and thymol in chitosan/citric2 2acid complex.

ASF was recently reported inDominican Republic and Haiti increasing concerns about the potential spread to U.S. soil. ASF isroutinely diagnosed by serological assays which offer important surveillance tools for biosecurity.Enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assays (ELISA) are used for serological surveillance of ASF butthere are no USDA-approved ASF ELISAs. ASF ELISAs on international markets have exhibitedlow sensitivity for detecting early infections vaccinations and low virulence strains. While ELISAis preferred for ASF screening confirmation tests are required. The immunoperoxidase test andindirect fluorescent antibody test are the only approved serological confirmatory tests but theyrequire handling ASFV which limits their accessibility. We aim to develop an ELISA confirmationtest which employs multiple recombinant ASFV antigens. This will be accessible to BioSafetyLevel 2 laboratories which are restricted from handling ASFV. We will screen and select ASFVantigens that have been under-utilized for diagnostic development and we will combine them withwell-characterize ASFV diagnostic antigens: p30 p54 and p72. We will develop the confirmationtest in collaboration with an OIE-recognized ASFV Reference Laboratory which enables us tovalidate prototypes with reference serum panels field samples experimental ASFV-infectionsamples and samples from vaccine field trials.

By analyzing binaries, the verifier will be able to build assurance cases even when manufacturers are unwilling or unable to provide source code. The GREASE tool will statically verify that COTS software binaries satisfy their requirements by lifting them into an intermediate representation suitable for analysis, converting requirements into static assertions, and verifying that the assertions hold on all program executions through under-constrained symbolic execution. This approach provides a strong combination of scalability, precision, and explainability. Requirements will be described in a constrained natural language, making GREASE suitable for use by auditors without a reverse engineering background.

To fabricate a focal plane array (FPA) with these materials, the manufacturer must physically bond the detector array to a ROIC, typically at die level, by flip-chipping a single detector array die to a single ROIC die, using bump bonding, an expensive and time-intensive process which requires specialized tooling. Recently, several low-dimensional materials, including quantum dots, nanowires, and 2D semiconductors have been identified as promising enabling technologies for SWIR, MWIR, and LWIR critical applications. In particular, mercury telluride (HgTe) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have attracted interest for their unique advantages as detector materials. Monolithic thin films of HgTe CQD materials can be patterned directly on a CMOS ROIC using solution processing techniques, enabling the development of low-cost, large-area imagers which can be produced without the need for expensive hybridization steps. HgTe colloidal quantum dots are capable of infrared detection from about 1 micron out into the LWIR, depending on the diameter of the quantum dot. Quantum confinement in HgTe CQDs enables wide spectral tunability from 1 micron to the LWIR by controlling the size of the dimensions of the nanoparticle, greater absorption coefficients, and lower Auger coefficients that may offer high temperature or uncooled operation for infrared imaging. The combination of all these factors motivates further study of HgTe colloidal quantum dots for imagers, particularly towards the development of novel, uncooled focal plane arrays (FPAs) at LWIR wavelengths. The objective of this program is to develop a low-cost, large-format LWIR imager targeting uncooled operation and cost-effective fabrication using HgTe CQDs as the detector material. In this Phase II effort, a custom ROIC will be designed and tested to complement the HgTe CQDs, development of the materials chemistry for preparing high quality LWIR HgTe CQDs will continue, and the manner of fabricating large format focal plane arrays with these materials will be developed. By the end of the Phase II, we will evaluate a prototype small-format HgTe CQD LWIR FPA, demonstrating LWIR imaging capabilities and TRL 5 readiness level, and establish a trajectory for producing >2K x 2K large format imaging for high volume deployment in military operations.",Mukund N Vengalattore,Program Manager,7035262238,mukund.vengalattore@darpa.mil,Matthew  Ackerman,,7022079759,mackerman@qdinfrared.com,,  ,

The complexity of modern surgical tools, such as surgical scopes, adds to the challenge because they are heat sensitive and cannot be sterilized by conventional steam autoclaves. Unfortunately, alternative endoscope sterilization methods are impractical for forward deployment, therefore new sterilization methods are needed to process medical and surgical instruments in the field.

The techniques remain popular in all high-performance metal due to their high level of control over composition, cleanliness, and homogeneity. The US Navy commonly uses Alloy 53 (AMS 6308) in safety critical applications such as helicopter rotors which is produced using a double vacuum melt VIM (vacuum induction melting) and VAR (vacuum arc remelting) process. Despite the advances of vacuum melting over the past century, parts made with Alloy 53 experience premature part failures due to the presence of non-metallic inclusions in the final product. Therefore, the US Navy will benefit from a cost-neutral technology that can reduce the presence of non-metallic inclusions and improve the overall quality of the vacuum melted material. The approach taken here focuses on the VAR process during which an electrode (produced by the VIM process) is remelted under vacuum by generating arc-discharges that super-heat the electrode surface. This process improves the solidification structure and further refines the material. During this process, low-density non-metallic inclusions nominally float on top of the melt pool and migrate to the edges where they are eventually removed. Arc behavior is a likely mechanism behind the persistent inclusion entrainment phenomenon of interest to the Navy. Furthermore, it is well documented that anomalous behavior of the arc distribution can create solidification defects such as the inclusions found in Alloy 53. To date, no technology exists to directly monitor the arc-distribution during VAR leaving a gap in the quality control. This is largely because a VAR furnace is inhospitable to common process monitoring tools (e.g. optical) due to a large metal furnace body and a high temperature plasma environment inside. To address this need, we have created a multifaceted approach to monitor and control the arc distribution during the VAR process to improve the consistency and quality of the final ingot. We use magnetic flux imaging to map the three-dimensional current distribution throughout the system. This technology enables monitoring of the arc-distribution over time. To enable the use of this technology we have performed a series of research-scale experiments and developed multi-physics simulations of the VAR process. By mounting electromagnets on the exterior of the furnace, we can create external magnetic fields to control the arc-distribution. Creating quality metrics with magnetic flux imaging enables the use of externally applied magnetic fields to correct deleterious arc behavior. Magnetic flux imaging and external control over the arc distribution will ultimately be used to create an ingot with improved micro-cleanliness to meet the goals of the US Navy to create a cost-neutral reduction in the inclusion content of Alloy 53.",Kurt N Prescher,TPOC,3013420865,kurt.b.prescher.civ@us.navy.mil,Paul  King,,5039393571,paul@amperescientific.com,,  ,

Essentially, we will explore how the previous knowledge of the statistics of the obscurant can help the computational reconstruction and can be exploited to enhance the asymmetry. We will identify fundamental limits in progressively sophisticated schemes, ranging from simple nanoparticle geometrical anisotropy to switching-based coded aperture schemes in tandem with computational reconstruction. We will develop fundamental limits in optics-only scenarios of passive, active, and nonreciprocal nanoparticles, as well as optics-plus-computational-imaging scenarios for which there is little understanding of the limits to what is possible. Information theoretic metrics will be used to identify such limits as well as design the system. A complete end-to-end design framework will be established to co-optimize the obscurant with the computational backend. This framework will employ a forward model consisting of multi-scale electromagnetic simulation coupled with computational reconstruction. The inverse design process will employ an automatic differentiation approach. We will perform experimental measurements testing the theoretical predictions, with a key goal being the measurement of computation-based visibility enhancements beyond the optics-only fundamental limits. A successful program would identify optimal long-term pathways for one-way visibility, the possible material systems, control schemes, metrics, and fundamental principles for achieving them. Three classes of NPs exhibiting anisotropic scattering patterns will be studied: one with geometrical anisotropy, which can be actively tuned by photoinduced structural changes, such as plasmon-enhanced volume changes. We will determine fundamental bounds that will likely tradeoff between asymmetric visibility and total transmissivity. In the second class, we will consider nanoparticles that support (reciprocal) gain, whereupon stimulated emission can be activated to generate asymmetric visibility that goes beyond the passivity bounds. Finally, going beyond the reciprocal passive and gain cases, we will consider particles with nonreciprocal responses, induced by nonlinear and/or magneto-optical effects, and develop the theory for ultimate bounds on nonreciprocity-based asymmetric visibility.",Rohith N Chandrasekar,Program Manager,7035262830,Rohith.Chandrasekar@darpa.mil,Arka  Majumdar,,6509068666,arka@uw.edu,University of Washington,Arka  Majumdar,6509068666

For example, the current gold standard used by many federal agencies is data de-identification, which offers only limited privacy guarantees and has consistently failed to provide privacy protection when evaluated in the scientific literature.  As another example, synthetic data approaches, which substitute representative but artificial data for sensitive data, require costly preparation: each data set owner must privately learn all necessary statistical relationships in the original data, and adequately replicate them in the synthetic data set.

Molecular dynamics and computational chemistry methods will be developed to digitally characterize NC designs. NCs of different shape and size will be designed and labeled with either or both of two different RMT peptides. Labeled designs and unlabeled controls will be digitally characterized, synthesized and tested for BBB permeability in an established in vitro BBB model. These assay results will be used in combination with design parameters as data for eventual ML training. Design parameters that promote BBB permeability will be derived from statistical analysis and from feature importance analysis of the resulting ML models. Feasibility of the approach will be established through the ability to rapidly design, build, and test candidate NCs in the limited timeframe of a Phase I project. Armed with these capabilities, in Phase II, the affect of size, shape, hydrophobicity, type and number of RMT ligands and other NC design parameters will be assessed via combinatorial in silico and in vitro evaluation. Highly ranked NCs with promising in vitro BBB permeability will be evaluated in vivo with the goal of generating data to support an IND application with the FDA.",Tessa M Pinon,Dr,(571) 616-6790,Tessa.M.Pinon.civ@mail.mil,Steven  Armentrout,,(703) 689-9689,steve@parabon.com,,  ,

Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine or effective therapy available for either infection. Synagis, a monthly intramuscular injection of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) palivizumab, is the only FDA-approved intervention given to a very small subset of high-risk infants as immunoprophylaxis. However, it is not effective at treating RSV infections. There are no MPV treatments currently in any stage of clinical development. Thus, for the tens of thousands of patients hospitalized for either RSV or MPV, only supportive therapy is available, and morbidity and mortality are substantial. Interestingly, both viruses spread in the lung by shedding daughter viruses exclusively into the airway lumen; shed viruses must then traverse airway mucus (AM) before infecting neighboring cells, and infections remain primarily restricted to the airways with little to no systemic viremia. We believe a virus-specific, safe, effective and topically-delivered antiviral would provide a powerful option to address the current gap in pharmacological interventions. Mucommune is developing MM004 to meet the urgent need for a bronchiolitis treatment, based on our “muco-trapping” mAb platform. MM-004 is a topical mAb treatment based on (i) bispecific mAb possessing “muco-trapping” Fc and binding domains that neutralizes both RSV and MPV, and (ii) direct delivery to the lung airways using a vibrating mesh nebulizer. By concentrating MM004 at the site of infection rather than delivering it systemically, we expect to enable efficacious and cost-effective treatment for both RSV and MPV, with little risk of adverse side effects, due to limited systemic adsorption after pulmonary delivery. In RSV-infected neonatal lambs, a highly relevant model for pediatric RSV, our muco-trapping mAb against RSV greatly reduced infectious RSV viral load in infected neonatal lambs in lung tissues to non-detectible levels, and reduced bronchiolitis, neutrophil infiltration and inflammation to levels that were often indistinguishable compared to uninfected animals. Building off this promising result, we have now engineered a bispecific mAb (MM-004) that potently traps both RSV and MPV in human AM and facilitates rapid clearance from the mouse lung. In this proposal, we seek to validate in Phase 1 whether MM004 can effectively treat MPV infections in hamsters, the best available model for MPV. If successful, we will advance to Phase 2, where we will develop a Master Cell Bank cell line for high yield production of MM-004 (Aim 1), and conduct a number of IND-enabling studies including, GLP tox studies in rats, tissue cross reactivity studies, and pre-IND filing (Aim 2). Both Phase 2 Aims are part of the critical path to quickly advance MM-004 into clinical development, and will put us in a position to file IND within 12 months from completing this project. Our work will also help pave the way for improved, molecularly-targeted aerosolized therapies against various respiratory infections.",  ,,,,RICHARD  CONE,,9177053371,cone@mucommune.com,,  ,

MN is a leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults and has a variable clinical course. About one third of patients enter spontaneous remission, whereas the remainder have persistent proteinuria that can lead to end stage renal disease and even death. In 2009, the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) that is present on podocytes was identified as the target of autoantibodies in about 70-80% of MN patients. Such autoantibodies are used as a diagnostic marker for MN, and patients with high PLA2R-specific antibody levels typically have a poor prognosis.  Although there are currently several therapies for MN, they can result in general immunosuppression and other severe side effects. For example, cycles of high dose steroids and alkylating agents can lead to cancer, osteoporosis and diabetes, and relapses occur in up to 30% patients within five years following treatment. B cell-depleting antibodies such as rituximab are also associated with increased risk of infection combined with a significant relapse rate. As a result of the limitations of existing therapies for MN, there is an unmet need for the development of improved, selective therapeutic approaches.  This project seeks to address the need for new therapies for MN by developing engineered, antibody-based reagents that specifically and rapidly deplete PLA2R-specific antibodies. Importantly, these depleting agents do not affect the levels of other antibodies that have a protective role against infection etc. This first-in-class, novel technology has been named Seldeg technology (for selective degradation).  The goal of the Phase I project was to provide a proof-of-concept by designing a Seldeg molecule and showing its suitability for clinical development using in vitro assays. In this Phase II application, we propose to move the Seldeg forward in the development process by carrying out the necessary in vitro characterization and studies in animal models. The Specific aims are:  1. To carry out drug development and testing of the PLA2R-Seldeg using in vitro analyses.  2. To analyze the in vivo behavior of the PLA2R-Seldeg and targeted autoantibodies.  The proposed approach could not only be transformative for the management of this potentially devastating disease, but would also lay the foundations for analogous Seldeg-based strategies to be taken in many other clinical settings where pathogenic antibodies lead to disease.",  ,,,,SUNIL  KANNANGANATSIDHARTHAN,,4046937174,sunil@asteroerado.com,,  ,

Because of the rising prevalence of mucormycosis risk factors, the incidence of the infection has risen. The increased number of mucormycosis cases is highlighted by the recent epidemic seen among COVID-19 patients (>47,000 cases have been reported in India alone since May of 2021). Despite disfiguring surgery and aggres- sive antifungal therapy, the overall mortality of mucormycosis remains at 50%, and approaches 100% in pa- tients with disseminated disease, persistent neutropenia, or brain infection. Clearly new strategies to prevent and treat mucormycosis are needed. The spore coating proteins (CotH) are cell surface antigens that are universally present among, and highly ex- pressed on, spores and hyphae of Mucorales fungi. CotH proteins are critical determinants of pathogenesis by enabling fungi to invade host tissues during initiation of infection and further hematogenous dissemination. The importance of CotH proteins to infection is highlighted by the high protective/curative capabilities of anti-CotH monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against murine mucormycosis. Through a Phase I SBIR funding, Vitalex Biosciences was able to humanize a protective murine MAb (VX01) that shows 10-fold higher binding ability to CotH3 antigen and is as protective as its parent mouse MAb against murine mucormycosis. Importantly, combination therapy of the humanized MAb and current standard of care of antifungal agents show high degree of synergy in protecting immunosuppressed mice from mucormycosis. In a GLP-compliant tissue cross reactivity studies, we show that VX01 has favorable cross reactivity to human tis- sues. Finally, we are now in possession of three Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) Research Cell Banks that are capable of producing 2-3 g/L of VX01. Thus, it is our intention to continue with the manufacturing of the human- ized MAb to enable IND-filing and initiation of clinical trials. Our specific aims are to : 1) perform Research Cell Bank (RCB) clonal candidate selection and develop/optimize upstream and downstream processes of VX01 production and purification; 2) perform analytical method development, formulation development and produce GLP material for toxicity studies; and 3) perform IND-application enabling studies including tissue cross reac- tivity and GLP-toxicity (main, recovery and toxicokinetics) studies in rats. The preclinical synergy between the VX01 and antifungals strongly indicate that developing VX01 as adjunc- tive therapy will strongly improve the abysmal outcome of mucormycosis. If successful, this study will shift the treatment paradigm by introducing the first adjunctive immunotherapy against fungal infections by targeting unique and pivotal aspects of mucormycosis pathogenesis. Achieving the manufacturing Aims of this proposal will position Vitalex to collaborate with big Pharma to conduct cGMP production, and clinical testing.",  ,,,,GARY  LAZAR,,3237129380,lazar.vitalex@gmail.com,,  ,

According to the CDC, >250,000 CLABSIs, having mortality rates of 14-40%, occur in the US annually, and among them >100,000 cases are directly related to hemodialysis central venous catheter (CVC). One of the tools currently used to reduce CLABSIs is the use of antimicrobial CVCs. However, the current antimicrobial CVCs remain susceptible to biofouling (i.e., biofilm formation) as they do not display repellency to biofoulants. In other words, host biomolecules and cellular debris from dead microorganisms can accumulate upon their surface, thereby facilitating adherence of living microbia and their associated biofilms. In addition, most antimicrobial CVCs function by gradually releasing embedded biocides/antibiotics with risk of developing antimicrobial resistance. To address the problems, we hypothesized that incorporating biofilm-repellent zwitterionic moieties together with antimicrobial gemini dicationic moieties into CVC surfaces, a synergistic effect could be realized. Our preliminary study confirmed the synergetic effect. Technology innovation is 1) the new CVC surface covalently immobilized with gemini dicationic moieties to provide best-in-class antimicrobial properties without concerns of development of antimicrobial resistance; and 2) the new CVC surface containing both biofilm-repellant and antimicrobial moieties to overcome the deficiencies of each alone to prevent the root cause of CLABSIs. To demonstrate the feasibility of our technology, in Aim 1, we will maximize the synergetic effect by iteratively optimizing the ratio between the antimicrobial and repellent moieties with respect to antimicrobial efficacy, biofilm repellency, coating anti-infective durability, over varying timeframes. In Aim 2, we will produce prototype hybrid CVCs, and compare their infection risks relative to commercial antimicrobial CVCs against pathogens responsible for >90% of CLABSIs. In Aim 3, we will evaluate bio- and hemo-compatibility of the prototypes using assays specified in ISO 10993-4 for hemolysis, coagulation, complement-activation, and inflammation as well as leachate toxicity. Expected outcomes in this Phase I include >20% reductions in proliferation, antimicrobial, and biofilm assays with a similar/better blood compatibility compared to current antimicrobial CVCs. >20% reduction in the national infection rate with our CVC product would prevent >50,000 CLABSIs, saving >16,000 lives and >$500 million direct healthcare costs each year. Phase II will include in-vivo studies to ensure accurate translation of in-vitro and ex-vivo properties. In Phase II, we will also initiate production of our prototype CVCs at a FDA cGMP compliant manufacturing facility, subsequently apply for 510(k) clearance for subsequent clinical evaluation. Our serviceable obtainable market (SOM) is the US CVC market, estimated to grow $1.3 billion in 2026.

(Intellisense) proposes to advance the development of its new CBRNE Augmented Reality Display and Device Integration Network (CARDDIN), demonstrated to be feasible in Phase I. CARDDIN is based on a modular network that incorporates CBRNE and geolocation information from all sensors and nodes in the network, fuses that data in real-time at each node, and streams AR video at 60+ fps to a heads-up display (HUD) worn by on-the-move users while minimizing the size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) of the electronics carried by each user. Each module in the network can independently provide all available CBRNE data to users and the network incorporates handoff algorithms to enable on-the-move users to move between module spatial coverage areas without interruption to the AR scene. CARDDIN is platform agnostic, enabling integration with any reconnaissance vehicle, command and control (C2) system (including inertial navigation systems (INSs) and the Android Team Awareness Kit (ATAK)), CBRNE sensor (whether vehicle-mounted, downrange, or handheld), and HUD. As a result, CARDDIN is compatible with existing and future platforms and can be easily upgraded and tailored for specific concepts of operation (CONOPS). Situational awareness is maintained by using intuitive warning indicators using Department of Defense (DoD)-standardized symbology, and CARDDIN’s scene management algorithm addresses issues of overlapping threat regions, ensuring situational awareness without increasing the cognitive load on the user. CARDDIN also incorporates built-in network security to ensure CONOPS integrity and to eliminate excess resource drain, improving the latency and operational time. In Phase II, Intellisense will mature the CARDDIN concept, support integration of the system onto a representative platform, and show integration with geo-referenced, off-board sensor systems, greater fidelity on the display, and increased usability for on-the-move users. By the end of Phase II, Intellisense will demonstrate CARDDIN in a relevant platform by combining the sensors on a vehicle exterior with the real-time AR view on a HUD device from the interior of the vehicle to demonstrate real-time CBRNE situational awareness. These Phase II results will be used to transition the technology to Phase III production.",Dawanne  Powree,,(919) 549-4238,dawanne.e.poree.civ@mail.mil,Marc  SeGall,,(310) 320-1827,msegall@intellisenseinc.com,,  ,

EMSCALe will collect EM signals using purpose-designed antennas, then pre-process and reveal the information embedded into the EM signals about different aspects of the components. EMSCALe will use models of software behavior and software-system-hardware interactions to form hypotheses about the signal models of the individual ICs. During the test stage, the framework will then update these hypotheses by matching the expected signals for each hypothesis to the observed signals. Having multiple hypotheses helps to cope with the presence of interrupts, input/output activity, cache misses, branch miss-predictions, other events, etc., and will allow EMSCALe to maintain high accuracy and fidelity while identifying components of an HIC of interest. These events significantly change the emanated EM signals in a way that is seemingly random. However, EMSCALe can account for these deviations and even use them to improve component identification. The basic concepts and initial feasibility of EMSCALe for IoT-class devices was demonstrated by the founders of Aether Argus Inc. in the DARPA LADS program. We will build upon that work to demonstrate the ability to identify the individual IC components and detect anomalies (hardware Trojan injected or counterfeit) in real-time on devices of interest. Aether Argus Inc. is a technology startup created by faculty members at Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech, bringing together technical expertise, know-how, and intellectual property created through participation in the DARPA LADS program in their academic capacity.

Unfortunately, the most potent organophosphate antidotes cannot access neurons from the systemic circulation. Phosphotriesterase (PTE) enzyme mutants are too large, and small, cationic oximes are too charged to cross the blood-brain-barrier or blood-nerve-barrier in appreciable quantities. State-of-the-art PTE therapy requires weekly prophylactic use as a blood-based scavenger; immunogenicity concerns and costly recurring doses dim its prospects for success in the field. Similarly, standard medicinal chemistry techniques for enhancing oxime access to nerves (e.g. lipophilization, prodrug design, hijacking active transporters) have failed to bear fruit. In this innovative Phase II effort, nSI will adapt our Phase I formulation and analytical workflows to handle (a) in vivo fluid volumes, (b) the formulation purification required for pharmacokinetic / biodistribution (PK/BD) trials in vivo, and (c) the use of high-activity PTE mutants instead of a PTE simulant. Using this scaled workflow, we will substitute PTE mutants for PTE simulants and assess impact on formulation parameters (and enzyme activity) for each formulation in our library, and expand our library from 50 to >200 passing formulations. Furthermore, we will continue work on formulation barcoding that began in Phase I, demonstrating (a) that barcode attachment does not impact formulation properties or PTE activity, and (b) successful formulation multiplexing capability in vitro. Finally, for each formulation in the library, we will also conduct in vitro stability studies (in plasma and at 37oC) and in vitro cytotoxicity and nanoparticle (NP) association/uptake studies using primary human neurons. The result will be a large, multiplexed, multidrug NP library that can be co-administered and rapidly screened for in vivo neurotropism in Phase III.

Advent is developing an aerosol formulation of its proprietary, optimized water miscible vitamin A (vitA) palmitate for non-invasive (inhaled) delivery to preterm infants to address vitA deficiency (VAD), and prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), its most serious and costly complication. Prevention of BPD is the focus of this Phase IIB/SMA application and a NHLBI topic of specific interest under this FOA, RFA-HL-23-008. We will be building on the very significant data supported by our Phase I/II SBIR award with our innovative inhaled vitA formulation that: 1) avoids the drawbacks of invasive intramuscular (IM) injections and absorption limitations of current oral forms, overcoming significant hurdles for routine NICU utilization, and 2) provides direct- to-target-organ delivery for increased efficacy- our in vivo data show significant benefit over IM dosing in mitigating hyperoxic lung damage (in our BPD animal model), while providing adequate systemic delivery to also treat VAD as discussed in the Research Strategy and in our recent publication (47).  In collaboration with Dr. Virender Rehan at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, we have completed all Phase I Specific Aims and are wrapping up Phase II Aims, demonstrating that inhaled vitA: 1) stimulates lung maturation (assay of lung biomarkers showing upregulation of retinol receptors, surfactant protein and phospholipid synthesis, as well as maturation biomarkers, while simultaneously raising serum vitA levels similar to IM dosing); 2) dramatically (vs IM) reduces hyperoxic lung tissue damage (assessment of lung tissue histomorphometry and reduction of lung-injury biomarkers); and 3) preserves pulmonary function (preliminary longer-term PFT data).  In Phase IIB, we will further refine inhaled vitA dosing strategies for mitigating hyperoxic lung damage (BPD prevention) in a step-wise approach by studying the well characterized premature lamb BPD model and proceed with IND-enabling activities to be ready to begin first-in-man clinical studies in preterm infants at risk for development of BPD. Phase IIb Specific Aims are: 1: Optimization of the dosing regimen of aerosolized vitA for mitigating hyperoxic lung damage in a premature lamb BPD model, focusing on both the “neonatal” (acute phase) timeframe, and also over the longer term (chronic phase) into “adulthood”, assessing similar biomarkers, morphologic, and PFT evaluation as per Phase I/II. Aim 2: proceeding with drug manufacturing development and scale-up of our formulation under stringent GLP and GMP controls. Aim 3: conducting GLP toxicology studies in both small (rat) and large (dog) species to support clinic-readiness. Measures of success will be generation of data supporting further development of our novel non-invasive therapy for preventing BPD (and treating VAD), including a vitA formulation that meets adequate CMC requirements to proceed into the clinic, and completion of GLP toxicology showing adequate safety for first-in-man studies in at-risk preterm neonates.",  ,,,,CRAIG  GELFAND,,7322676065,craig.gelfand@advent-therapeutics.com,,  ,

T2SL FPAs have become very attractive candidates for various MDA/DOD sensor platforms including air, space, ships, and missiles. T2SL wafers, the starting materials of FPAs, are grown on large substrates using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) in commercial growth foundries. A non-destructive, quick-turn, full-wafer screening capability will help them better serve MDA’s missions. The mapping measurement of minority carrier recombination lifetimes across an entire wafer is required to evaluate the semiconductor materials used for detector fabrication and to optimize the detector fabrication processing procedures. To fulfill these requirements, EPIR proposes to build a 6-inch, 300 K to 50 K temperature, minority carrier lifetime mapping system coupled with a cut-off wavelength measurement and mapping capability. The system will measure carrier recombination lifetimes down to 5 ns and their wafer-level distribution. We plan to use a pulse semiconductor laser with a rise/decay time of less than 1 ns as an excitation source and a long-wavelength-infrared (LWIR) laser as a probe light. The laser-generated excess carriers will lead to increased free carrier absorption related to the excess carrier concentration. Free carrier absorption decay can be detected using a fast (>200 MHz ) LWIR HgCdTe detector and collected using high-speed data acquisition electronics. In addition, broadband infrared light will be introduced at the same position on the sample and measure the transmission spectra in a 2-12 µm wavelength range using an EPIR-made LWIR linear detector array that will be mounted with infrared gratings in an optical multichannel analyzer configuration to quickly determine the cut-off wavelength. A cryogenic two-dimensional scanner will be built for mapping and scanning measurements over up to 6-inch or 150 mm diameter wafers in a single run. With further maturation of the system and technology, the proposed system can be integrated into other semiconductor material evaluation and device fabrication lines, including HgCdTe and other sensors that operate below room and/or at cryogenic temperatures to conduct temperature-dependent lifetime and absorption spectroscopy measurement in a non-destructive manner.

Motivated by the success of PHASE I research, wherein several bioresorbable glasses in the Na2O-K2O-CaO-B2O3-P2O5 have been developed, our two-year PHASE II research program aims to optimize two or three specific compositions for dissolution behavior in simulated biofluid, hygroscopicity, mechanical ruggedness, and biocompatibility. The last topic will be studied by our research partner Penn State University. Phase separation behavior of the glass with heat-treatment, subsequent partial crystallization to develop glass-ceramic objects will be studied using XRD, TEM, and ionic leaching kinetics to follow preferential dissolution, if any. Additional modified chemical strengthening may be applied to improve the mechanical strength which would allow thinner but more rugged stent structures to be made with less material to be dissolved. Stents will be made either by a direct drawn tubing or by 3D additive manufacturing process. The latter process enables us to make complex shapes. Our Research Partner Co-PI, Professor James Adair, is a well-recognized bioglass researcher; being a protégé of the late Professor Larry Hench (often called the Father of bioglass). In that respect, Dr. Adair is one of the best to conduct transition research from our Phase I bioglasses to Phase II and moving over to Phase III with little to no learning curve in between. Penn State offers relevant biomedical engineering research experience and has world-class facilities.

The result is a higher performance digital PCR system that matches the simplicity, speed, and low per-assay cost of real-time PCR. Real-time PCR maintains great popularity in clinical diagnostics, but digital PCR is superior to real-time PCR because it provides absolute quantitation, greater accuracy at low concentrations, and greater reproducibility. However, because it was hypothesized that uniform volumes are required for digital PCR quantitation, current digital PCR platforms require precise microfluidic chips and control, which result in low throughput and high per-assay costs. Here we propose to address these limitations by developing a digital PCR system that employs variable volume droplets created simply by shaking a sample along with PCR reagents and an oil/emulsifier mix to create an emulsion. PCR is performed, and droplets in the emulsion are imaged and sized. Droplets with one or more copies of a nucleic acid are identified, and nucleic acid concentration is determined. We call this edPCR (emulsion digital PCR). We characterized this edCPR method via computational simulations and validated it experimentally. Simulations were used to investigate the dependence of droplet occupancy on analyte concentration and droplet size distribution, and to estimate the accuracy of the measured concentration in the presence of errors in measurement of droplet volume. Simulations also provided an estimate of dynamic range for a given droplet size distribution and statistical power. The method was validated experimentally in terms of accuracy, precision, and dynamic range, and to rule out potential sources of biased error, such as droplet shrinking and droplet fusion during PCR. In the proposed work, we will develop a commercial edPCR platform that will offer the superior performance of digital PCR while providing the high-throughput (e.g. 384 well plate operation) and low per-assay cost of real-time PCR, which we believe will remove the barriers to the widespread use of digital PCR in clinical assays, point-of-care settings, and large-scale testing.",  ,,,,PETER B ALLEN,,5123647552,peter.allen@dplexbio.com,,  ,

This methodology includes understanding of device physics and irradiation sources, as well as utilization of irradiation facilities and dosimetry of irradiated microelectronics. The methodology necessarily incorporates design of testing procedures, development of experimental setups including microelectronic measurements, and performing statistical analysis of device radiation effects data. Simulations and modeling are important to understand the induced radiation effects at the component level. In Phase I of this project, we began to develop testing methodologies using available radioactive source at the University of Utah (UofU). This included preliminary calculations, experimentation, and formulation of understanding the radiation effects in tested devices (e.g., diodes and MOSFETs) via testing analysis. We completed the goals of Phase I and demonstrated the efficacy of our methodology. In Phase II, we will continue to develop our methodology for testing the radiation effects in microelectronics from gamma- and beta-rays. We will compare the effects on electrical and material properties between the two radiation types to formulate a quantitative mapping of radiation types (gamma and beta) and effects. We will also test the radiation hardness of Rad Hard microelectronics and compare them against standard COTS devices. The project purpose is to: 1) Refine our overall physics-based strategy; 2) Further define the experimental design, guided by analytical calculations, simulations, and prior test results; 3) Measure gamma-ray and beta-ray (electrons) effects in microelectronics using a variety of irradiation sources; 4) develop simulations and models for understanding radiation interaction and induced electrical effects in microelectronics; 5) Develop a table top unit for irradiation testing that can produce photons (gamma-ray energy equivalent x-rays), electrons, and importantly, simultaneously mixed photon/electron radiation fields for microelectronics testing; 6) perform analysis of radiation effects against a variety of parameters (e.g., device powering, radiation TID, radiation type, energy, and duration, device radiation tolerance, etc.).

The HIV pandemic has caused an estimated 33 million deaths to date. In the U.S. alone, 1.2 million people
currently live with HIV and 34,800 new cases were diagnosed in 2019. This adds up to an estimated $16.4 billion
for a lifetime of HIV treatment for patients in the U.S. HIV infects immune cells which express the CD4 and
CXCR4/CCR5 co-receptors including helper T-cells. Even after a patient mounts an initial, effective immune
response, the virus persists undetected by the immune system in quiescently infected CD4+ T-cells. For this
reason, the primary treatment for HIV, combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), is not able to eradicate HIV from
patients. Many HIV patients are able to live with continuous treatment, but this is both costly and uncertain to
remain effective given the recent identification of a more virulent strain of HIV-1 in which patients suffer an
accelerated loss of CD4+ T-cells. There is a critical need for innovative, efficacious therapeutics to direct a more
robust immune attack of the virus.
One promising strategy is to generate more active anti-HIV CD8+ cells. Chimeric Antigen Receptor-T cell (CAR-
T) is a relatively new process in which patient T-cells can be programmed to attack cells expressing a target
protein characteristic of a specific disease. When used with agents to make infected cells visible, it has been
hypothesized that CAR-T will support the host immune system to fully eradicate HIV-infected cells. There are
currently several technological limitations to the production of CAR-T cells, and the rate limiting step is transfer
of genetic material into the primary T-cells to program them to eliminate cells expressing a target protein. Current
methods of creating CAR-T cells demonstrate an inefficiency barring translation from the laboratory to clinical
settings. Lipofection inefficiently transfects primary T-cells, and electroporation and biolistics both damage cells.
Retroviruses are limited to 8-10 kb of genetic material which limits advanced applications, are toxic to cells if
used at too high a dose, and are complex to construct. In addition, retroviruses integrate into their target cell’s
genome which could inactivate a tumor suppressor gene and create tumors.
AGTC has developed a novel method of introducing biomolecules into mammalian cells using an array of closely
packed, aligned carbon nanotubes to achieve highly efficient transfer with low cytotoxicity and high capacity for
genetic cargo. This technology has potential to overcome size limits of current gene-transfer technologies in
addition to being simpler, faster, and more flexible. In this proposal, AGTC will (1) optimize gene transfer into
primary human T-cells using carbon nanotube technology (CNT); and (2) create human anti-HIV CD8+ CAR-T
cells against HIV envelope glycoprotein, gp120. Successful completion of the proposed work will enhance
knowledge about CNT capabilities, and allow AGTC to proceed to further testing of the CAR-T cell product with
an eye to therapeutic use in HIV positive patients.",  ,,,,OMAR  BAKHT,,(617) 599-9869,omar@agtclabs.com,,  ,

Onchocerciasis is fought by mass drug administration (MDA). WHO critically needs new diagnostic tests to support decisions to start and stop MDA programs and released in 2021 the corresponding desired target product profiles (TPPs). The most stringent TPP criterion is that the test must be extraordinarily specific (≥ 99.8%). Our non-profit sister company Drugs & Diagnostics for Tropical Diseases (DDTD) was hired in 2020 and 2021 by the Task Force for Global Health (TFGH) and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to develop a new rapid diagnostic test for onchocerciasis. We succeeded in developing an assay composed of two novel O. volvulus antigens that are arranged as two distinct test lines on the assay strip. In an independent evaluation, the CDC found the test to be 89.6% sensitive (95% CI: 79.2-95.2%, N=58) and 100% specific (95% CI: 99.95-100%, N=194). This means that our biplex test meets the sensitivity and specificity requirements of both TPPs and, remarkably, its specificity is >99.8% even at the lower bound 95% CI. In view of these data, USAID has already committed funding to evaluate the assay in the field on approximately 10,000 individuals, which will be conducted by the TFGH in early 2023. Given these exciting results, the massive relevance for public health, and the big momentum already garnered with key players (USAID, CDC, TFGH), we are now requesting Direct-to-Phase II funding from the NIH to swiftly progress the assay to manufacturing and commercialization. Phase II funding will be used to (1) optimize the biplex test in a reel-to-reel manufacturing-friendly mode, and to secure access to critical reagents, (2) establish a robust manufacturing process, with a focus on minimizing costs and maximizing speed, with SOPs and QC protocols validated for a manufacturing context, and data on lot-to-lot reproducibility data recorded in our QMS, and (3) produce 100’000 devices (in 5 lots of 20’000) that will be donated to the stakeholders (TFGH/USAID) to support further field testing and jump-start test adoption. It is noteworthy that said stakeholders have already sponsored our initial (“Phase I”) research, hence will have a vested interest in ensuring maximum return on their investment by facilitating all downstream activities necessary to provide a clear path to commercializing our test. We respectfully submit that a first-in-class tool, such as our new test, that will support the elimination of river blindness, a disease with 21 million active cases and 218 million at-risk individuals, will address an unmet need of paramount significance for global public health.",  ,,,,MARCO A BIAMONTE,,8584051277,marco.biamonte@bigeyedx.com,,  ,

Recent research has shown that the mutant AR protein misfolds, aggregates, and abnormally interacts with other proteins, leading to androgen dependent lower motor neuron degeneration and skeletal muscle atrophy. Currently, there are no treatments available to slow, stop or even reverse the progression of SBMA; therefore, the unmet medical need is high to discover novel therapeutic agents against the disease. Experimental studies for the treatment of SBMA have focused on interaction of the AR with testosterone. Removing testosterone via castration in animal models appears to be protective and restores some lost function. AR knockout in SBMA patient-derived stem cells differentiated into neurons reverses the neurotoxic effects of the mutant AR. These findings have led to the use of anti-androgenic therapies for SBMA treatment. Our awarded Phase 1 SBIR grant to evaluate our NTD-binding selective AR antagonists and degraders (DAARIs) in preclinical models of SBMA and our Phase 2 SBIR grant have generated strong in vitro and in vivo data, and preclinical manufacturing development to progress the development of ONCT-505 as a potential SBMA therapy. Our objective is to generate specific data for ONCT-505, described below, that will ultimately support the submission of an investigational new drug (IND)-application. ONCT-505 has been studied in various preclinical models of AR-dependent diseases, including SBMA and advanced prostate cancer. Importantly, ONCT-505, unlike any other molecule targeting the AR, binds to the AR activation function-1 (AF-1) domain in the NTD and leads to signaling antagonism and ultimately AR protein degradation via ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. ONCT-505 is orally bioavailable with pharmacokinetic (PK) and drug-like properties suitable for drug development and demonstrated efficacy in SBMA preclinical models better than surgical castration. The molecule did not show overt toxicity up to 200 times the ED50 (effective dose of 50% observed efficacy) in pilot toxicology studies and also lacks cross reactivity with other proteins. These properties make ONCT-505 an ideal candidate for further evaluation as potential small molecule therapeutic for patients suffering from SBMA. Successful completion of the outlined studies will result in a clinical drug candidate with demonstrated preclinical efficacy, well-documented safety profile, and scalable GMP-compatible manufacturing process.",  ,,,,RAJESH  KRISHNAN,,7602773193,rkrishnan@oncternal.com,,  ,

enfumafungin-like pathways from fungal strains in an engineered Aspergillus nidulans host. The sequence-
specific cloning and heterologous expression of lead molecules discovered in this program will establish methods

Vascular disease is the most common disease pathology in the US, costing the country’s healthcare system over $437 billion dollars annually. Because vascular interventions have limited long-term success, there is a critical need for effective therapeutics, including to address the condition of IH which, post intervention, can lead to restenosis, or artery narrowing. By delivering therapeutics safely and efficaciously to specific tissues, the proposed technology will result in improved quality of life and decreased morbidity and, in combination with a Contact Research Organization business model, will contribute to the advancement of a multitude of RNA therapeutics targeting the vascular system and eventually other areas of the body. Eventually, the platform will contribute to the development and commercialization of a broad range of RNA drugs, creating jobs in science, sales, and manufacturing. This project will lead to improvements in the treatment of a variety of diseases and conditions that currently lack effective therapy, resulting in improved quality of life and decreased morbidity in the broader society._x000D_

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop a novel multifunctional lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery system for tissue-specific targeted delivery of RNA therapeutics to the vascular system. Intimal hyperplasia (IH), a condition triggered by mechanical injury to blood vessels, causes artery thickening in ~ 60% of peripheral vascular disease patients 12 months post-intervention. IH often results in the need for additional surgical intervention with associated costs and increased patient morbidity and mortality. This project will focus on inhibiting the remodeling pathways that lead to IH via RNA therapeutics delivered directly to the injury site. The project will develop vascular targeting liposomes designed to exhibit multifunctional potential to target exposed collagen matrices specific to areas of vascular pathology and enhanced targeted vascular uptake/delivery. Phase I will advance the LNP technology by showing that an active therapeutic encapsulated by the system is appropriately delivered and results in a clinically relevant drug concentration. If successful at delivering bioactive RNA payloads to injured vascular tissues, the technology will reduce the risk of post-intervention complications and reduce the need for revascularization. Ultimately, this novel LNP packaging and delivery system will provide a new tool for advancing a broad range of RNA therapeutics._x000D_

Recently, the intensive investigation of human genes and related diseases has improved the capability of gene
therapy as a promising future therapy that can significantly increase life expectancy for millions of patients
suffering from incurable diseases. This promise has accelerated the exponential growth in the field of gene
therapy. However, the clinical potential of gene therapy remains largely unleashed, mainly due to the limited
biomanufacturing capacity of gene delivery products for clinical and commercial use. Manufacturing of gene
therapeutic biologics involves harvesting viral vectors in mammalian cell cultures which are highly complex
and difficult to control. The lack of understanding and control of the viral production processes has led to
manufacturing challenges including low productivity, instability of cell lines, high levels of impurities, and
difficult scalability with consistent product quality. Therefore, new biomanufacturing analytical technologies
are critically needed to improve the understanding of the bioprocess dynamics and to support development of
robust and efficient biomanufacturing processes.Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI), in collaboration with the University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML) proposes
to develop a novel biomanufacturing process analytical technology tool that enables in-line, continuous
measurement of the metabolism of host cells in bioreactors for the large-scale manufacturing of therapeutic
viral vectors. A novel metabolic cytometry sensor probe that measures the autofluorescence of intracellular
metabolites will be used for real-time assessment of cellular-level redox metabolic state. An innovative
spatially and temporally confined spectroscopy approach is used to efficiently differentiate fluorescence
signals of intracellular metabolites from the nonspecific light background, achieving high specificity
measurement of cellular physiology. During the Phase I program, a prototype fiber-based fluorescence
cytometry probe system will be fabricated and evaluated, demonstrating the capability of the real-time
metabolic measurement during bioreactor operations for viral vector production. Technology maturation and
application demonstrations in additional bioreactors using a variety of culture organisms will be performed
during the Phase II program. Successful development of this technology will contribute to significant

In response to National Institute on Aging's (NIA) strategic plan and PAS-19-317, we propose novel therapeuticsto
treat Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRDs). We have developed novel combinations of three natural
product compounds, which modulate complementary pathways in multiple types of CNS cells (i.e., neurons,
microglia) associated with AD pathology. These compounds were originally discovered through our previous
computational systems biology research on AD target discovery and drug repurposing funded by NIA AMP-AD
consortium where we identified over 6000 potential targets and prioritized more than 3000 candidate compounds,
including natural compounds, FDA-approved drugs, and small-molecules. These compounds were identified via
analysis of multi-omics data from large-scale post-mortem brain tissues of AD patients using our computational
systems biology approach. In this project, we propose to further confirm the safety in wild-type (i.e., C57BL6/J
mice) and therapeutic efficacy using an established murine model of AD (i.e., 3xTg mice) for our novel combinations
of natural product compounds. Additionally, we will validate the correlation of our novel sex- and APOE genotype-
specific serum-based metabolic biomarkers and additional protein biomarkers with the therapeutic effects of our
treatment in this AD mice model.
We hypothesize that these natural product combinations will prove to be safe and effective therapeutics
for treatment of ADRD. To address this hypothesis, we proposed the following three aims:
Aim 1: To evaluate systemic and central toxicity of NAD+/PEITC and NADH/PEITC. In this aim, we will first
validate the compound structure and formulation stability with LC-MS and NMR. Next, we will use male and female
C57BL6/J aged 6 months and 15 months to test brain, liver, kidney, and heart toxicity of our combinations during
the acute (3 days), subacute (7 days), and chronic (28 days) periods post-dose.
Aim 2: To evaluate therapeutic effects of these drug combinations on AD Biomarkers and Functional Cognitive
Performance in 3xTg mice. Here, we will measure effects of our therapeutic combinations on brain levels of
amyloid beta proteins (i.e., Ab(1-38), Ab(1-40), Ab(1-42)) and hyperphosphorylated tau. We will also test effects
of our combinations of natural products on neurocognitive performance using the novel object recognition test
and the Morris water maze. All studies in Aim 2 will be conducted in male and female 3xTg mice aged 6 months
and 15 months.
Aim 3: To evaluate additional blood-based therapeutic biomarkers of these drug combinations. Using blood
samples collected from 15-month-old male and female 3xTg mice (Aim 2), we will validate novel blood-based
metabolic and proteomics biomarkers for evaluation of therapeutic responses of our combinations via
metabolomics and proteomics data analysis.
Our preliminary results on both in-vitro and in-vivo model have demonstrated great promise on significant
neuroprotection, stimulation of microglial phagocytosis and improving working memory of 3xTG mice. Upon the
success of this project, we will be ready to further confirm the safety and therapeutic effectsof these combinations
of compounds for MCI and/or very early-stage of AD in a clinical study.",  ,,,,RUI  CHANG,,(646) 570-2546,ruichang@arizona.edu,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,  ,

But, at such high current densities, the superconductor is susceptible to localized heating at defective spots which causes a thermal runaway, leading to a catastrophic failure. Uniform, long tapes with minimal defects are desirable to avoid these hot spots. The critical current (Ic) of long REBCO tapes is tested for uniformity only at 77 K in zero applied magnetic field. But there is strong evidence that even tapes that exhibit uniform Ic at 77 K, 0 T can have inconsistent Ic in a magnetic field at lower temperatures. Consequently, sections of a long tape that have lower Ic in a magnetic field at lower temperatures – that are not detected by Ic measurements at 77 K, 0 T – can be a location of quench and onset of failure. While long tapes with uniform Ic are highly desirable to avoid hot spots, methods to manage local defects in REBCO have to be investigated. Unlike metallic superconductors like Nb3Sn which consist of thousands of fine filaments, the wide geometry of REBCO tapes is not conducive for easy current sharing between tapes in a coil or cable. The objective of the proposed project is to develop defect tolerant REBCO tapes that promote current sharing between tapes to bypass current around local defects to reduce the possibility of quench and potential failure. In the Phase I effort of the proposed project, AMPeers worked with the University of Houston to design, develop, and test REBCO architectures that are defect tolerant and provide pathways to shunt current around defects. In addition, we worked to minimize defects in tapes using in-line quality control during fabrication. Further, we developed a reel-to-reel (R2R) Scanning Hall Probe Microscope (SHPM) measurement of Ic at 65 – 77 K in magnetic fields up to 5 T. Using the in-field R2R SHPM, we detected recessive defects that are not obvious in Ic measured at 77 K, 0 T, that can possibly be an origin for quench. In the Phase II project, we will evaluate all approaches for defect-tolerant REBCO tapes in terms of efficacy of current sharing, scalability to manufacturing, and impact on other properties relevant to applications; select the best choice and evaluate quench characteristics of meter-long tapes. We will then scaleup the best approach for defect-tolerant REBCO tape to 50 meters and deliver long lengths of defect-tolerant tape to Navy for independent evaluation. Additionally, we will design and construct a coil with long lengths of defect-tolerant REBCO tape and demonstrate its effectiveness in quench mitigation.",Peter N Ferrara,Engineer,(215) 897-8057,peter.j.ferrara@navy.mil,Eduard  Galstyan,,(518) 312-8337,egalstyan@ampeers-llc.com,University of Houston,Christopher  Grant,(713) 743-7464

The technology can support highly efficient refrigeration at a fraction of the operational cost and electrical demand of traditional systems. Adoption of this cooling technology by small- to mid-size supermarkets would enable significant cost savings for electricity.

This SBIR Phase I project develops a renewable, closed container cooling system incorporating a rechargeable vacuum insulation and a novel two-stage heat pump. This project involves 1) developing a rechargeable vacuum insulation technology that does not use vacuum pumps; 2) creating a modified dewar connected to a fully renewable cooling system enabling cooled inner chambers; and 3) evaluating the ability to use environmental heat to restore the solutions that power the cooling system allowing their reuse. The novel heat pump technology is based on two asynchronous stages: the first utilizes concentration gradients as a driving mechanism enabling thermal transfer, while the second uses environmental heat to re-concentrate saline solutions after dilution during stage one. Together, these two stages enable cooling of a closed container. The project will examine system configurations able to generate large thermal gradients, enabling maintenance of 1.5-5°C temperatures within the dewar. Advantages of this system include 1) the system’s ability to cool continues in the absence of electricity making it resilient to power outages from itinerant weather, wildfires, and earthquakes; 2) lossless storage of cooling capacity; and 3) significantly reducing the greenhouse gas footprint compared to conventional refrigeration._x000D_

Materials that are highly effective in stopping the nuclear by-products before they encounter sensitive electronics or the war-fighter can mitigate the need to develop radiation-hard components or biological countermeasures following radiation exposure. Unfortunately, the current shielding modality, in which one adds more material-depth in order to increase the attenuation of any damaging quanta, is unattractive for deployed missions because of the weight and size of high-Z materials for photon shielding becomes operationally cumbersome.          One must therefore modify the underlying material in order to elicit transformational improvements in current shielding materials. If one can make a material with multitudinous interfaces, such as provided by a combination of high-Z (e.g. Pb) nanoparticles potentially bonded to low-Z polymeric components, then the small interfacial loss per interaction can accumulate to dominate the attenuation characteristics. Our nanostructured gamma-ray shielding material has: (1) a transformative mechanism- distributed multitudinous interfacial scattering at nanoparticle surfaces- to enhance stopping power and neutral particle attenuation, (2) 1/10th to ½ the mass density of the equivalent bulk material, (3) a very high temperature resilience (up to 752 0F), (4) a low-cost solution-based synthesis, (5) a high thermal (and electrical) conductivity, (6) a flexibility and high-damping of mechanical vibration, and (7) a readily scalable production method.      During Phase I, our goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of forming large-volume, nanostructured composite shielding with a gamma-ray linear attenuation coefficient at least twice that of the equivalent bulk material. Although solid nanoparticles, composed of lead for instance, can achieve this goal, our wave-mechanics modeling predicts that core-shell nanoparticles are substantially superior in exploiting gamma-ray redirection effects within a heavily loaded solid. We will therefore form PbO/Pb, CdS/PbS, and Pb hollow-core nanoparticles and form those into solids through either bottom-up self-assembly methods or through top-down milled-and-pressed methods. The advantage of the latter is that the organic constituents, which govern the self-assembly for bottom-up approached, are avoided and one can therefore make a more component-pure nanostructured solid from which to prove the feasibility of enhanced stopping. The advantage of the solution-based nanostructured composite approach is that the process is simple, scalable, and low-cost and therefore ultimately preferred for commercialization of the material.",Tabitha N Dodson,Program Manager,(571) 218-4239,tabitha.dodson@darpa.mil,Suneel  Joglekar,,(765) 609-1308,suneel@amphionic.com,,  ,

This SBIR Phase I project will develop a new technology that enables hydrogen fuel cells with catalysts containing a low percentage of platinum group metals and a membrane electrode assembly with high activity and durability.Key pain points in the fuel cell market are the high loading of platinum group metals in the catalysts and the poor durability of the current catalysts during operations. The goal is to develop a commercially viable route to the durable and low-platinum-content catalyst and membrane electrode assembly by nano-engineering the metal composition and synthesis scalability.The proposed research and development will accomplish three major tasks including the development of a scalable synthesis route for the production of the targeted catalyst, the preparation of the membrane electrode assembly, and the evaluation of the performance in the hydrogen fuel cells._x000D_

More than 7% of the world’s population carry hemoglobin gene mutations that result in hemoglobin variants, one of which is Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). SCD impacts about 100,000 Americans. The trait form of SCD is the Sickle Cell Trait, which results from inheriting a single copy of the gene that causes the disease. Sickle cell trait affects up to 3 million Americans and 8 to 10 percent of African Americans. 100 million people worldwide have sickle cell trait. Another major hemoglobin variant is β- thalassemia, which affects approximately 1.5% of the world population. Optimal management of anemias, beta- thalassemia, and SCD requires early diagnosis and monitoring of the patients using blood tests that measure hemoglobin level and type. For example, in the United States, more than half of patients living with SCD are treated with Hydroxyurea (HU). Regular blood transfusions are commonly performed in SCD. Efficacy in both HU and transfusions is reflected in changes in hemoglobin (Hb) composition; HU increases the proportion of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and transfusions reduce the proportion of sickle hemoglobin (HbS). However, current methods to monitor Hb composition require that samples be sent to a central lab, resulting in delays in patient feedback, provider decision-making, and treatment modification. Treatment monitoring and management would benefit from POC testing with immediate results. There is no FDA-approved point-of-care (POC) diagnostic device for sickle cell or beta-thalassemia in the United States. We present Gazelle as the first and only POC diagnostic platform for screening and treatment monitoring for SCD, beta-thalassemia, and anemias in the US. In the SBIR Phase I/II Fast Track project phase, we established manufacturing and distribution partners overseas and commercialized Gazelle for SCD and thalassemia testing outside the US with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa and India. Our commercialization strategy for Gazelle has been focused on low-income Global markets, and we have successfully achieved this goal with growing sales in 13 countries to date. The next step is to commercialize Gazelle in the US market. The Phase II Bridge award is timely and critical for us to achieve this goal. In this SBIR Phase IIB Bridge project, we plan to carry out and complete US-centric analytical and clinical validation studies for FDA 510(k) applications and commercialize Gazelle in the US as the first and only integrated POC diagnostic platform for SCD, beta-thalassemia, and anemia, as well as treatment monitoring of HU and transfusion therapies. We will create a distribution strategy, develop partners, commercialize, and start marketing the Gazelle diagnostic platform in the US.",  ,,,,PETER  GALEN,,5035605607,p.galen@hemexhealth.com,,  ,

Currently, only 10-15% of patients undergoing surgery receive continuous blood pressure monitoring because such monitoring requires specialized skill to administer the invasive procedure and can also introduce potential complications. The remaining patients are monitored intermittently with a non-invasive blood pressure cuff, resulting in gaps in information between readings and potentially delayed response times. Rapid blood pressure drops are associated with poor patient outcomes such as organ damage/failure, post-surgical complications, and death. The success of this project has the potential to not only increase the number of surgical and critical care patients who receive continuous monitoring, improving quality of care and patient outcomes, but also to enable continuous blood pressure monitoring in other applications, such as in pre-eclampsia patients in obstetrics. This project also has commercial potential. With over 50 million surgeries performed in the US each year, the serviceable, addressable market is $2.5 billion per year. Expanded to the global market where over 230 million surgeries are performed annually, the total addressable market is over $11 billion._x000D_

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a wireless, continuous, and non-invasive blood pressure monitoring device that can capture rapid fluctuations in blood pressure with high temporal resolution. Current technologies developed to address the unmet need for non-invasive, continuous blood pressure monitoring have been limited in their accuracy, cost, and ease-of-use. The research objectives to advance this project to commercial and clinical readiness are: device optimization through sensor improvement and algorithm development, form factor development for mechanical and electrical stability, and development of a smart calibration system for improved usability. Through iterative device design and testing in clinical environments, this project aims to tackle the long-standing challenges of continuous blood pressure monitoring, namely motion, calibration, and signal drift. The Phase II project outcome is a wearable, non-invasive, and continuous blood pressure monitoring device to be used in the operating room and intensive care unit. This device has the potential to not only empower clinicians with greater insight into patient condition, enabling rapid response and improved care in the clinical setting, but it can also be used to improve understanding of disease progression, treatment effectiveness, and patient stratification across demographics._x000D_

The fluid in the eye is isolated from the rest of the body by a blood-ocular barrier, so obtaining blood work does not help for diagnosing most ocular problems. Testing of ocular fluid has been shown to decrease rates of blindness in cases of ocular infections. However, this procedure is under-utilized due to the flaws with the current method for collecting fluid. Because of this, ocular infections can be misdiagnosed and undertreated, which can lead to increased rates of vision loss. Additionally, ocular fluid is an untapped reservoir for emerging biomarkers which has created an unmet need for better tools to collect this fluid. This project will result in a new product that can be used to collect ocular fluid for analyses that will guide treatment of some of the most common sight-threatening conditions including macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetes.

The research will include optimization of the needle to decrease the force of entry. This new tool will enhance the surgeon’s control during the procedure and decrease risk of injury. This research will also investigate the fluid dynamics of collection with the integration of a microfluidic chamber and specialized collection system that is designed to handle small fluid volumes. A significant limitation of the current procedure is that the fluid volumes collected are small and the current method leads to fluid loss and inaccurate results. Additional development will evaluate advanced engineering features to connect the device for drug delivery.

Alcohol dose-dependently induces ACM, characterized by progressive reduction in myocardial contractility and ventricular dilatation, culminating in heart failure. At the cellular level, chronic alcohol consumption results in cardiomyocyte death, cardiac inflammation, and cardiac fibrosis. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for ACM. The long-term goal of this project is to advance emodin, a small molecule natural compound with anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-fibrotic activities, for ACM prevention or treatment. We have generated a robust body of background data in the basic science and early discovery phase that supports emodin as a novel therapy for ACM including: 1) TGFβ signaling is the primary underlying mechanism responsible for alcohol-induced cardiac fibrosis, a key component of ACM pathogenesis, 2) Emodin is an effective inhibitor of TGFβ canonical and non-canonical signaling in multiple cell types, 3) The pharmacokinetics (PK) and excellent safety of emodin have been examined in murine models, and 4) At non- toxic oral doses, emodin effectively ameliorates cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction associated with doxorubicin, a pathology similar to ACM. Furthermore, our preliminary data illustrates that emodin attenuates alcohol-induced loss of cardiomyocyte viability and activation of cardiac fibroblasts. We propose to further test the central hypothesis that emodin can be developed as a safe and effective preventive and/or therapeutic agent for ACM. In this Phase 1 STTR application, we propose to examine the PK, safety, and efficacy of emodin in chronic alcohol consumption rodent models and perform a PK and toxicity study in pigs in the following three specific aims. SA1. To test if alcohol consumption influences emodin metabolism and evaluate the safety and efficacy of emodin in ameliorating ACM in mouse models. SA2. To examine the PK, safety, and efficacy of emodin in reducing cardiac fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction in alcohol-fed rats in both prevention and treatment settings. SA3.To perform a PK and safety study of emodin in pigs and find a safe dose range that may achieve effective blood emodin concentrations. By the end of the funding period of this STTR Phase 1 application, we will possibly move emodin towards the next phase of drug development: IND-enabling preclinical study. Milestones for a Go/no-go decision include: 1) if emodin does not exaggerate alcohol-induced toxicities in mice and rats, particularly liver toxicity; 2) if there is significant efficacy of emodin in ameliorating ACM in mice and rats; and 3) if an appropriate safe dose is identified in pigs that can be extrapolated to humans. If answers to the above three questions are positive, the decision will be made to further the development process of emodin, and a Phase II application will be submitted to perform an IND-enabling preclinical study, including 1) safety and efficacy studies in pig ACM models in a GLP setting, and 2) formulation and cGMP manufacturing of emodin capsule for human use.",  ,,,,WAYNE E CARVER,,8032163803,wayne.carver@uscmed.sc.edu,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,  ,

In addition, a single use-case for Engine Cans was implemented and tested.   Based on feedback received from discussions with various SYSCOMMS across the Navy, it would be very useful for the leadership and decision makers across these SYSCOMMS to see additional use cases for this technology. As such, the primary focus of this expansion effort is to demonstrate the applicability of the Ryalinks technology towards enabling additional use-cases that can alleviate cost and improve operational efficiency and readiness in potentially multiple SYSCOMMS across the Navy. In the following sections, a few of these additional use cases are outlined. It is important to note that these new use cases were communicated to the Ryalinks team by the ground support team at various locations across North Island. It is expected that as we continue to engage with NAVSUP and NAVAIR leadership throughout this expansion effort, the scope and definition of these use cases will be further fine-tuned to adapt to the specific use-case scenarios as outlined by the customer leadership and decision makers.  Throughout engagements, demonstrations and discussions, the Ryalinks team will attempt to quantify the benefits of adoption of this technology and build the Return on Investment case for why each SYSCOMM should adopt this technology. This ROI analysis needs to happen when an initial implementation of these use cases has been built, tested and demonstrated (the main focus of this expansion effort). Upon successful demonstration of these use cases, the cost of this solution and the operational impacts can be quantified, thus enabling a meaningful ROI analysis.   Additionally, every additional test will improve the technical maturity of the product. The Ryalinks engineering team will attempt to stress the network at every site which will have slightly different RF characteristics. These tests will be key towards enabling a successful HERO test when necessary. At every demo, it is expected that invaluable feedback will be received towards the usability of the back-end system. This will eventually lead to the integration of the Ryalinks back-end into the required proprietary Navy back-ends such as NADACS. Whether or not the actual integration with these back-end networks are completed as part of this expansion effort will depend on the requirements of the SYSCOMM that will be interested in ultimately adopting this technology.",Woei-Min N Lin,TPOC,(703) 588-2235,woei-min.lin@navy.mil,Hooman  Honary,,(949) 981-0481,hooman.honary@gmail.com,,  ,

_x000D_
This STTR Phase I project proposes to examine a high-fidelity model to support the design and control of an advanced wind turbine blade configuration with an adaptive twist angle distribution (TAD). Conventional control is generally applied to rotor torque to maximize wind capture, and thus production, below the rated wind speed. Above this speed, control shifts to the blade pitch angle to maintain full power. However, limitations in existing designs lead to trade-offs where wind capture or power production is relinquished to reduce loads, mitigate vibration, and improve stability. The actively adaptive TAD provides greater control capabilities and satisfies these objectives without trade-offs. A crucial goal of this research is the means to understand the complex aeroelastic and aerodynamic relationships with respect to the TAD. The technology is a high-fidelity model that simulates these dynamics and the aeroelastic performance in a reasonable amount of time. This model involves the development of a framework combining these dynamics and uses computational tools that leverage data analytics and machine learning. The technical result of the proposed work is the creation of a digital twin that enables effective design and robust control of highly sophisticated blades with adaptive TAD._x000D_

The solution will renew the battery catalyst without its removal from the vehicle. This will result in significant savings toward the total cost of ownership and an increase in overall system reliability, one of the top features potential customers evaluate when making automotive purchasing decisions. The transportation industry has been seeking innovations to transition to sustainable solutions such as zero-emission and green hydrogen fuel cell technologies, but the broad adoption of such vehicles is limited by the short lifespan of fuel cell electrocatalysts that operate, expensive fuel cell stack replacements, and the high costs of components. This project will make hydrogen fuel cell vehicles viable and cost-competitive with diesel and gasoline engine vehicles by extending the lifetime of the electrocatalyst and thereby the fuel cell stack. Such alternative options are needed, as diesel vehicles are responsible for around 20% of anthropogenic pollution precursor emissions, and these emissions are linked to approximately 110,000 premature deaths per year._x000D_
_x000D_
This SBIR Phase I project proposes to establish a proof-of-concept approach for in-stack platinum electrocatalyst renewal. Since fuel cell electrocatalysts degrade during operation, this project will develop a breakthrough technology that enables the reuse of what was once considered expended, end-of-life fuel cells by renewing the electrocatalyst.This renewal process can be conducted multiple times after the electrocatalyst inevitably degrades, increasing the lifetime and durability for fuel cell operation. As one of the most expensive precious metals, platinum typically used as the catalyst for automotive applications contributes to about 60% of the total fuel cell cost. This process is the first-in-kind to allow electrocatalyst renewal at the surface of the electrode without removing or replacing the fuel cell stack. This project will establish working parameters for the electrocatalyst renewal and analyze the effects of the process using a custom testing apparatus with a 3-electrode configuration and on commercial fuel cell membrane electrode assemblies in custom single-cell configurations. This team will utilize several techniques including analytical electrochemistry, microscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance techniques to verify the effects of the process._x000D_

As the world electrifies light- and heavy-duty vehicles and renewable energy resources increase, the need for battery materials is expected to quadruple over the next decade. Hydrometallurgical processes are highly nuanced and well-established; The configurations are nearly endless, especially when multiple recycle streams are incorporated. Additionally, customers require tight specifications. As battery chemistries evolve, a process technology that can be shown to be adaptable to variable compositional profiles can help proliferate domestic production to anchor advanced industries. _x000D_

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to fill knowledge gaps in separation chemistries using sulfites. Through exploitation of solubilities, effective and efficient separations of constituents in end-of-life lithium-ion batteries can reduce reagent consumption, decrease equipment sizing, and lead to the formation of battery-grade chemical feedstocks for demonstrated supply chain circularity. Key to the success of the project is the separation of manganese without resorting to expensive solvent-based techniques. The project will explore of the solubilities of Ni/Co/Mn/Li sulfites as a function of temperature and pH, characterize the form of the precipitates, and investigate the oxidation of these sulfite precipitates to a high purity sulfate. The objectives include determining missing data on empirical solubility from the general material property literature, demonstrating lab-scale selectivity and overall efficacy, and optimizing operational parameters for techno-economic and life-cycle modeling._x000D_

It is associated with a lower quality of life and a higher rate of morbidity and mortality primarily due to poor hemodynamic performance and often stroke. One of the primary options to treat AF is cardiac ablation where the physician applies radiofrequency energy via percutaneous catheters to form a series of lesions that directly destroys or isolates abnormal sources of electrical activity. Specific to AF ablation, a series of lesions are created to encircle the pulmonary veins forming an electrical barrier that isolates the arrhythmogenic foci inside the vein from the rest of the heart. However, while attempting to form lesion sets, the physician inadvertently leaves viable gaps that can be extremely difficult to detect, especially when the tissue is electrically stunned but remains metabolically viable. When this happens, these gaps will heal over time and reconduct the abnormal electrical activity to the rest of the heart, causing high post-procedural recurrence rates. As such, there is a strong clinical need to identify these gaps. Unfortunately, to date there are limited means for real-time monitoring of tissue injury and gap detection during ablation procedures and there are no means of directly detecting permanently damaged cardiac tissue. Here we propose to commercialize a new generation of percutaneous catheters that can distinguish viable from ablated cardiac tissue by sensing, in real time, spectral changes in tissue autofluorescence profiles caused by thermal damage. During the Phase II we produced and tested in live animals two versions of catheters, one that acquires an optical signature from a single fiber at the point where catheter tip touches the tissue, and a more complex version capable of hyperspectral imaging. This Phase IIB proposal seeks NIH funding to help commercialize the first optically enabled therapeutic ablation catheters under the trade name OmniView™. The first major task of the proposal to do so will be to manufacture 270 catheters and 20 instruments to be used for V&V testing and the subsequent clinical trial. These catheters and the instruments will undergo extensive V&V safety testing based upon standards outlined in the proposal. GLP live animal testing will be conducted in the large-animal porcine model. Following successful V&V testing, we will prepare an Investigational Device Exemption document set for submission to the FDA in order to receive permission to begin the clinical trial. We have identified five hospital sites with highly regarded electrophysiologists who are eager to participate. We have also held initial meetings with the FDA to obtain feedback on clinical strategy and have identified a CRO for clinical trial oversight. We will then perform the clinical trial as the key step towards commercialization. In summary, there remains an unmet clinical need for a system that can distinguish, in real-time, healthy versus ablated myocardial tissue with high resolution in order to identify and ablate gaps between lesions. Our new generation of percutaneous catheters and instruments is capable of acquiring tissue autofluorescence profiles during the ablation procedure therefore assisting physicians in providing better care.",  ,,,,TERRY  RANSBURY,,9192607305,terryransbury@gmail.com,,  ,

Project Summary This project proposes to develop a new analyte sampling technique for Molecular Rotational Resonance (MRR) spectrometers for the volatilization of solid phase analytes. The proposed system, Laser Induced Acoustic Desorption (LIAD), will enable a large number of important compounds to be accessible by MRR, enhancing our understanding in several important areas of research and accelerating pharmaceutical development. The resulting expansion of sampling range and corresponding utility of this valuable technique will greatly accelerate the adoption of MRR in important areas of research and development. MRR is a spectroscopic technique for unambiguous structure determination and quantitation of small molecules, which has been used for decades in academic research laboratories, but only recently commercialized after the recent achievement of several groundbreaking innovations. MRR excels in structural and isomeric analysis, providing a detail of information like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), but at a much lower cost and faster speed, with reduced method development. Through working on a final piece of the puzzle, the development of new sampling techniques, BrightSpec seeks to unlock the full analytical potential of this powerful analytical technique to broaden its use throughout a range of applications, including metabolomics, drug discovery, natural product analysis, and the monitoring of environmental pollutants. BrightSpec has evaluated several sampling techniques for volatilization of solid samples and Laser Induced Acoustic Desorption (LIAD) was determined to be uniquely suitable for incorporation with MRR, as the sensitivity of results with these instruments can be adversely affected by the presence of solvents.

The tradeoffs between these factors determine the applicability of the detection/identification system to support operational needs. Our low cost is driven by the elimination of agent specific reagents. MALDI TOF MS uses commonly available chemicals and are not subject to the supply chain issues that plague PCR and immunoassay based bioidentifiers. Our detection method is based on MALDI (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization) mass spectrometry, which over the past several years has become a gold standard clinical diagnostic tool. The Zeteo team has been developing this science and technology over several years. The system samples individual bioaerosol particles and uses laser-based, Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (TOF MS) to determine the masses of the biomolecules (proteins, peptide, lipids, carbohydrates) across a wide mass range (100-100,000 Daltons). This technique was pioneered by the Zeteo team when employed at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU-APL) and, in one format, has been commercially transitioned to clinical diagnostic laboratories worldwide where >10,000 different clinical isolates are accurately identified. This powerful technique measures specific threat signature masses derived directly from the genome of the threat organism, or toxin-producing organism, (analogous to PCR or WGS signatures) and are not class-generic spectral features typical of infrared or Raman approaches. While the bioidentifier has excellent specificity and sensitivity (~100 organism) for nucleic acid-containing microbes, it also has outstanding specificity and sensitivity (pg) for biological toxins, and other biochemical threats. The threat databases for the sensor can instantly be updated at the system level, as signatures and algorithms improve, and new threats are added. The effort proposed here combines a novel electrospray method to prepare particles for analysis, significantly reducing pumping size and power requirements. Ions are formed in a low vacuum region before entering the high vacuum of the mass analyzer. In Phase I we demonstrated the efficacy of each of the major system components.

This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of determining volumetric (3D) hydrocarbon distribution throughout large-diameter long cores with high spatial resolution (10 mm3), 95% accuracy, and 1 meter/hour throughput at the offshore/onshore wellsite. Today, this is not possible with any technology, i.e., logging data can be used to derive hydrocarbon estimates on a sparse set of points along the wellbore, while “special core analysis” at onshore laboratories takes weeks to complete. Neither of the current techniques can closely match the resolution and accuracy offered by the proposed solution. The disruptive innovation of this development is to combine 3-dimensional (3D) X-ray Multi-Energy Computed Tomography (MECT) and Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) in one wellsite core scanning instrument, thereby allowing for novel, synergistic combination of the information provided by the MECT and EIT modalities. Algorithms will be developed to combine the complementary datasets to yield 3D hydrocarbon distribution in the cores in near real-time. These algorithms will be tested on realistic digital core models. The ultimate goal of Phase I is to demonstrate that the specified target accuracy, spatial resolution, and scanning-imaging throughput for assessing 3D distribution of hydrocarbons in large cores can be achieved with the new wellsite instrument._x000D_

Both the axial and DACS subsystems of the ESP use non-toxic, liquid, non-cryogenic, high-performance propellant drawn from a common source. The propellant components are stored as liquids under their saturated vapor pressures. The ESP employs autogenously pressurized nitrous oxide as an oxidizer, and a mixture of ethane and ethylene is used in the same manner as fuel. Ethane-ethylene mixtures of about 50-50 have the same vapor pressure-temperature curve as nitrous oxide, allowing for lightweight common-bulkhead isothermal tanks. By utilizing the autogenous pressurization capabilities of these propellants instead of an additional pressurization system, greater system simplicity and reliability can be attained. The ESP’s nitrous-ethane-ethylene (NEE) engines can obtain a specific impulse (Isp) of 300 sec, nearly as high as that obtainable using toxic hypergols, but the ESP’s overall system performance is better because of the mass saved by its employment of self-pressurizing common bulkhead tanks. The ESP NEE propellants are cheap, non-corrosive, indefinitely storable on Earth or in space, and compatible with military air transportation requirements, making them a high-performance, green propellant solution for spacecraft engines. The extensive experience and background of the proposed Pioneer Astronautics, Colorado State University, and Moog SBIR team in the areas of propellant formulation, propulsion system and engine design and integration, engine testing, and scale up will lead to rapid development, testing, and implementation of the proposed ESP. In the proposed program, the Pioneer Astronautics/CSU/Moog team will demonstrate an ESP system combining a 250 N NEE liquid propellant thruster for highly responsive orbit change maneuvers with 10 N NEE gas thrusters for DACS. This is an excellent design for an integrated propulsion system for a spacecraft in the 100 kg class. Conceptual designs of ESP systems to meet the needs of 10 kg CubeSats and 1000 kg spacecraft will also be developed, thereby demonstrating concept scalability. With the demonstration of a working prototype ESP system able to meet the needs of an important spacecraft class, and its scalability shown for a wide range of others, the stage will be set for maturation and eventual commercialization of ESP technology.

Epigenomic mapping of histone PTMs in limited cell populations or single cells (SCs) would provide the opportunity to study the epigenetic landscape of rare and heterogenous cell populations and be highly enabling for drug discovery research. The recent development of the antibody-mediated genomic mapping approach CUT&Tag (Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation) permits the study of select, abundant histone PTMs using very few cells and even SCs. Despite this progress, ultra-low input and SC CUT&Tag assays still present a unique challenge, and have not yet been successfully applied to many challenging targets, such as less abundant histone PTMs. Indeed, to maximize data yield per cell, ultra-low input and SC CUT&Tag assays require antibodies to exhibit high on-target epitope binding with minimal off-target binding, which most commercial antibodies do not offer. We envision a new class of “SC-grade” antibodies that deliver ultra-efficient histone PTM binding for dramatically increased CUT&Tag assay sensitivity, improving reliability and providing access to new targets that are currently intractable. Here, EpiCypher will leverage a novel antibody development pipeline to generate ultra-efficient, “SC-grade” antibodies to unlock the potential of genomic mapping technology for next- generation ultra-low input / SC applications. Unlike traditional antibody development pipelines that use histone peptides for screening, a central innovation of our strategy is the implementation of recombinant modified designer nucleosome technology during antibody development. In Phase I equivalent studies, we used our novel approach to select and validate ultra-efficient antibodies for two key histone PTM targets (H3K4me1 and H3K4me3), generating antibodies that exhibit a >5-10x increase in nucleosome capture efficiency vs. current best-in-class antibodies. Importantly, these ultra-efficient antibodies generated significantly greater signal-to- noise in genomic mapping assays that employ low cell inputs, demonstrating strong proof-of-concept for our approach. In Phase II, we will leverage this validated antibody development pipeline to develop a suite of ultra- efficient antibodies and use these reagents to develop low input and SC CUT&Tag assays for breakthrough immunology research. Toward this goal, we will first develop and screen antibodies for high-value histone PTM targets (Aim 1). We will then scale up production and rigorously validate antibody lots in CUT&Tag assays using both low input and SC workflows (Aim 2). Finally, we will test the application of our next-generation ultra-efficient antibodies to enable cutting-edge immunological research and provide our antibodies and validated protocols to leading epigenetics laboratories for beta testing (Aim 3). This research project will result in the development of a new class of histone PTM antibodies that will be used to increase the utility of CUT&Tag assays for breakthrough chromatin research and drug discovery.",  ,,,,ANDREA L JOHNSTONE,,5096600107,ajohnstone@epicypher.com,,  ,

overdoses, and other health related testing necessities. Thus, significant commercial opportunities exist because of the lack
of these capabilities as painfully “demonstrated” in the current pandemic. Mass spectrometry (MS), because of its ability to
detect hundreds, even thousands, of biological compounds in a single acquisition provides the capability to distinguish
chemical differences associated with, e.g., different pathogens and disease states, as well as target specific compounds in
bodily fluids. Current MS approaches use ionization methods requiring user expertise and frequently specialized
instrumentation, which significantly increases cost. Over the past 30 years, mass spectrometers have undergone a
renaissance in their cost-to-capability ratio. For more widespread applications of MS in advancing healthcare, there is a
need for new advanced ion source technology that provides for minimal user intervention and long-term use without
maintenance. These attributes are necessary if testing of thousands of individuals daily per instrument to e.g., identify, track,
and contain the spread of infectious diseases is to be implemented using MS in the future. The goal of this NIH SBIR Phase
I project is to demonstrate that an entirely new ion source concept constitutes a disruptive technology and effective method
that can be used for the next-generation disease test measurements. The basic invention of this proposal is covered by a
MSTM patent application (#20210343518, March 31, 2021), and earlier IP exclusively licensed to MSTM which can be
applied to widely available atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometers, including portable and ultra-high

high-throughput, low cost, and the capability to retrofit with most commercial mass spectrometers to provide rapid,
sensitive, and accurate data on demand. The objective of this Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of this
technology by constructing a manual dual vacuum ionization source that can be automated in Phase II for nearly hands-free

potentially disruptive healthcare technology: Aim 1: Construct a manual vMAI/MALDI source capable of future automation

ease of use, quantification, accurate mass, MS/MS, and fingerprint analyses of pathogens. MSTM has the necessary

Institution: IsoTruss Inc.
Principal Investigator: Dr. David W. Jensen
As society further develops technologically reliable broadband connections become an
increasingly foundational resource used to access business education healthcare public safety
and more. Financial burdens and physical isolation limit rural communities' ability to build the
infrastructure to establish high speed broadband connections. Without the requisite
infrastructure rural areas are left to fading technologies resulting in reduced business outdated
education and spotty healthcare to say the least. IsoTruss seeks to design a tower and
installation system that will eliminate those roadblocks to infrastructure expanding the reach and
quality of internet service to rural America.
IsoTruss will use the Phase I project to prove the feasibility of the crane-less tower
technology. The objectives are to generate a tower design and installation plans for a crane-less
deployment; to evaluate many potential crane-less tower solutions with respect to cost time and
safety; and to locate a future proof-of-concept site with an interested customer. By the end of
Phase I IsoTruss will complete a baseline design and analysis and be ready to move forward with
prototyping and a proof-of-concept deployment in future projects. Once developed and tested
the IsoTruss crane-less tower technology will be commercialized with the intent to assist in
establishing infrastructure in any location regardless of distance or topography.",  ,,,,David  Jensen,,(801) 830-0792,dwjbyu@gmail.com,,  ,

Many hypersonic vehicle components, including control surfaces, engine components, and actively cooled leading edge structures, utilize high temperature niobium and molybdenum alloys such as C103 and TZM respectively. These refractory alloys have found use in hypersonic vehicle applications because of their shared properties, including high melting point and excellent high temperature strength. To date, conventional oxidation-protective coatings such as R512E have provided sufficient oxidation protection to the metal alloys. However, as hypersonic vehicle performance advances, these metallic components will be exposed to operating environments that far exceed the capabilities of conventional oxidation protection coatings. To enable the next generation of metallic components for hypersonic vehicle applications, new oxidation-protective coating systems will be required to protect the alloys from oxidation at high temperatures. To extend the operating temperature range of carbon/carbon (C/C) composites for hypersonic applications that experience the highest heat fluxes, Ultramet has developed and successfully demonstrated a hafnium carbide-silicon carbide (HfC-SiC) coating, designated Ultra2000 and applied via chemical vapor deposition (CVD), as a replacement for SiC on C/C structures through extensive prior and currently ongoing work. The objective of the proposed project is to develop a coating system that enables Ultra2000 to be applied to C103 and TZM alloy substrates. The goal is to develop a coating system that results in a strongly bonded Ultra2000 topcoat on C103 and TZM that is resistant to thermal shock and provides high temperature oxidation protection for these alloys. A fully developed and characterized coating material system and process for Ultra2000 on C103 and TZM will be developed.

In 2020, 10 million people were newly diagnosed with TB and 1.5 million people died from the disease. As efforts to treat TB expand, the prevalence of infections caused by drug-resistant Mtb strains (DR-TB) that are resistant to one or more frontline standard of care (SoC) antibiotics is increasing, in part due to the long duration (6 months) of combination therapy (4 antibiotics) for drug-sensitive TB (DS-TB), which leads to poor patient adherence. Treatment for DR-TB is even longer, ranging from 6-24 months typically, with 3, 4 or more antibiotics taken in combination. While the last decade has seen a TB drug development “renaissance,” including the discovery of bedaquiline, newly approved regimens still suffer from serious side effects and can be cost prohibitive. Therefore, new classes of drugs with new MoAs that can be combined with existing or new TB drugs in the pipeline are desperately needed. The success of bedaquiline, which disrupts energy metabolism in Mtb and has shown promise in reducing treatment times for DR-TB, has accompanied an explosion of drug discovery targeting respiration in Mtb. In this application, Fimbrion proposes to develop a thiazolino-pyridone (TZP) small molecule series with growth inhibitory activity against Mtb as a novel drug for treating TB. While the target of this compound series is currently unknown, TZPs appear to act through disruption of Mtb respiration. Interestingly, current TZPs not only have direct antimycobacterial activity, but they can also potentiate the activity of isoniazid (INH), an important frontline TB antibiotic, even restoring INH activity against INH-resistant Mtb in vitro. Our primary goal in this project is to develop a first-in-class, orally bioavailable, antimycobacterial TZP compound that could become part of a new frontline TB drug regimen to help shorten the duration of treatment. Currently, our most potent TZP compounds have sub-micromolar growth inhibition potency in vitro, and favorable drug-like properties. Therefore, our primary Phase I goal will be to improve growth inhibition potency while maintaining and/or improving the drug-like properties of the lead compounds to enable testing of optimized compounds in an animal model of Mtb infection. Specifically, we will 1) use medicinal chemistry drug design strategies to improve in vitro potency, metabolic stability, and solubility, and will establish in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles (including oral bioavailability) for optimized TZPs in mice; and 2) investigate the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of prioritized lead TZPs and generate spontaneous mutants resistant to these compounds to better understand the bacterial target and MoA. As we have found that the antimycobacterial potency of our TZPs tracks with their ability to potentiate INH, we will continue to spot-check this secondary property throughout the optimization of our TZPs. Upon completion of this project, we expect to identify an advanced lead TZP compound with demonstrated efficacy in a mouse model of acute TB, which could be further developed in a future Phase II SBIR project as part of a combination therapy for treating both DS- and DR-TB.",  ,,,,THOMAS J HANNAN,,3149564525,hannan@fimbrion.com,,  ,

Title: SMoLDER: Situational awareness ModeLing and Decision support Engine for wildfire Response
PD: Koplik Gary J.
Institution: Geometric Data Analytics Inc.
In 2020 58950 wildfires burned 10.1 million acres one of the highest acreage impacts in
recorded history. Wildland firefighters particularly those in remote environments often rely on basic
tools such as paper maps compasses and two-way radios providing limited communication and
situational awareness. In addition the value of wildfire modeling efforts to responders is still inhibited by
runtime and lagging input data.
Geometric Data Analytics proposes the development of a situational awareness data
augmentation of wildfire modeling and intervention decision support tool coupled with real-time data
collection to support wildfire management. Leveraging national wildfire data and
satellite-communication enabled devices collecting data on-site we will employ these data and
communication systems to improve current situational awareness data-driven near-term wind models
and intervention scenario models for managing wildfires. The anticipated result of the proposed effort is a
proof-of-concept version of SMoLDER: Situational awareness ModeLing and Decision support Engine
for wildfire Response (Figure 1).
SMoLDER will both enable advancement of modeling efforts in the research community and
help firefighting crews manage wildfires more effectively saving lives reducing resources spent on
control and significantly reducing loss of property and natural resources.
Near-term potential commercial applications include a situational awareness and decision support
platform for wildfire responders as well as the wildfire monitoring and modeling community. Once efforts
in wildfire applications are underway we anticipate exploring similar applications for other emergency
response to severe weather events the military and environmental monitoring.",  ,,,,Gary  Koplik,,(919) 670-0808,gary.koplik@geomdata.com,,  ,

Project Summary/Abstract  C. difficile now causes more hospital-onset infections and deaths in the US than any other pathogen and is the most important cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea among adults in industrialized countries. In 2017, there were an estimated 462,100 combined healthcare- and community-associated C. difficile infection cases in the US, and 20,500 in-hospital deaths. In a randomized trial, soap and water washing for 30 seconds reduced but did not eliminate hand contamination in patients with CDI or asymptomatic carriage of C. difficile, whereas alcohol hand hygiene had no effect. The hands of healthcare workers frequently become contaminated with C. difficile spores, but hand washing with soap and water has only modest efficacy, and alcohol-based hand sanitizers have essentially no efficacy against spores. Thus, there is an important unmet need for development of effective strategies to reduce the burden of spores on hands. Given the concern that unrecognized asymptomatic carriers contribute significantly to transmission, there is an urgent need for comprehensive approaches applicable to persons who directly care for CDI patients, and also more generally for all hand hygiene.  We have developed a practical and highly innovative approach to meet this need through the development of a sporicidal hand wash that is effective in significantly reducing C. difficile spores on skin. Our hand wash formulation is based on the use of a new class of microstructured fluid (MSF) made with microfibrillated cellulose which significantly enhances the removal of C. difficile spores from skin by physical and mechanical means compared to traditional soap and water. The shear stresses generated at the skin surface during washing with MSF are 10 to 100 times higher when compared to what can be obtained with traditional soap and water. Importantly, we have recently discovered that when the microstructured fluid is made with the inclusion of novel and skin-safe sporicidal ingredients at neutral pH, we are able to achieve ∼3.5 log reduction of C. difficile spores from porcine skin in 30 seconds according to comprehensive testing. This discovery constitutes a significant improvement over conventional soap and water, and in principal, should result in high assurance prevention of transmitting C. difficile infection. This new discovery is significant since current alcohol-based hand sanitizers are ineffective against C. difficile spores. This project is focused on: 1) optimizing and finalizing the MSF hand washing formulation based on testing with an established skin model with the goal of achieving >3 log reduction of C. diff spores and important HAI infections from skin; 2) manufacturing the MSF hand wash product under GMP, performing compatibility/stability studies and developing quality control requirements; and 3) testing the safety and tolerability of the MSF hand wash on skin as required by FDA.",  ,,,,MOHAMED E LABIB,,6096830215,labib@novaflux.com,,  ,

These new giga-watt (GW) class sources require fast, repeatable, high voltage, high power driving pulses in order to perform optimally. Traditionally, sources of this caliber have been driven with spark gap switched pulse generators. While remaining a highly viable option for HPM source driving, spark gap switched systems have several inherent limitations that detract from their attractiveness as next generation HPM drivers. Those limitations include debilitating plasma recovery times, restrictive switch electrode ablation, and high shot-to-shot jitter, which combine to reduce achievable pulse repetition rates, system lifetimes, and pulse reproducibility. However, as solid-state switching technologies continue to improve, fully solid-state systems are becoming capable of performing in GW-class HPM systems. Previous Russian work shows the feasibility of using semiconductor opening switches (SOS) as drivers for nonlinear transmission line (NLTL) HPM sources at peak power levels above a giga-watt. During Phase I of this SBIR effort SARA conducted a trade study between an improved spark gap switched Marx generator and a fully solid-state Marx generator driving an SOS output stage. The analysis demonstrated both approaches to be capable of meeting the Navy and Air Forces performance requirements. Due to considerably higher performance capability, developments from US sourced opening switch R&D, and DOD input, SARA has elected the solid-state SOS architecture for further advancement in this Phase II.

Of special importance is the strong preference (~90%) for the pathogen to establish infection within the central nervous system, especially through infection of the meninges leading to cryptococcal meningitis. This is the leading cause of meningitis world-wide and is associated with a very high mortality rate (~80%). Treatment of cryptococcal infections is difficult owing to the limited number of effective treatment options available. The difficulty of many antifungal drugs to effectively traverse the blood-brain barrier and reach therapeutically relevant concentration within the CNS limits current treatment options to just three agents: fluconazole, 5-flucytosine and amphotericin. The evolution of substantial levels of resistance to fluconazole and 5-flucytosine in circulating strains of Cryptococcus has significantly undermined these agents while the toxicities associates with amphotericin are a well-known problem. Based on the limited options for treating these life-threatening infections, there is a compelling need to develop more effective agents capable of reaching the CNS. QMD is developing antifungal antifolates that inhibit the essential enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Although DHFR is a clinically validated target in several eukaryotic pathogens such as Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii, the efforts to exploit this target for antifungal drug development has lagged far behind. QMD has identified a novel inhibitor against Cryptococcus that is characterized by high levels of antifungal activity while initial dose-tolerance and pharmacokinetic studies suggest the compound has a favorable profile to demonstrate in vivo efficacy in animal models of infection. In this Phase I application, we will work to advance this program for the treatment of cryptococcal infections by (1) antimicrobial profiling, PK/PD studies and elucidation of mechanism(s) of resistance, (2) exploring structural modifications to increase the selectivity index over the host enzyme, and (3) evaluation of lead and back-up compounds in murine models of infection. Successful demonstration in proof-of- concept in vivo efficacy will enable us to further advance these antifungal candidates toward clinical application.",  ,,,,DENNIS L WRIGHT,,8604869451,dennis.wright@uconn.edu,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT,  ,

Project Summary/Abstract The encephalitic New World alphaviruses (NWAVs), consisting of Eastern, Venezuelan and Western Equine Encephalitis Viruses (EEEV, VEEV and WEEV, respectively), are transmitted by mosquitoes through rodent or bird hosts and have caused significant periodic epizootic outbreaks in equines and humans in the Americas. NWAVs can cause severe neurological disease, with fatal encephalitis in up to 70% of cases, and significant long-term sequelae in survivors. With recent climate changes, geological redistribution of mosquitoes carrying NWAVs further enhances the potential for future outbreaks. Moreover, concern over their potential use as bioweapons is well-founded due to their ease of production, high infectivity, ability for aerosolization, and capacity to induce disease, resulting in select agent classification for E/VEEV. Despite awareness of these viruses for nearly 100 years, licensed human vaccines against E/V/WEEV remain unavailable for general use. The development of next-generation vaccines that can safely and effectively protect humans against these pathogenic alphavirus infections are urgently needed. This project seeks to develop a cross-protective recombinant subunit E/V/WEEV vaccine based on the linked ectodomain portions of Envelope 2 (E2) and E1 proteins of each NWAV adjuvanted with SLA-LSQ, a novel TLR4 agonist combined with the saponin QS-21 in a liposomal formulation. The proposed approach provides a means to deliver a safe and stable vaccine to protect against infection by all three NWAVs using a scalable manufacturing platform that, in combination with a proven Th1/Th2 balanced adjuvant, elicits a robust, efficacious and durable immune response through both neutralizing and non-neutralizing means. The proposed NWAV vaccine is based on our highly immunogenic and fully protective pre-clinical E2/E1 candidate vaccine for the closely related Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). New preliminary data demonstrates that mice immunized with the NWAV E2/E1 subunits generate high NAb titers to non-select agent strains of E/V/WEEV. The Specific Aims of this project are: 1) evaluate the immunogenicity and optimize formulations of individual and combined recombinant E/V/WEEV subunit proteins with SLA-LSQ adjuvant; 2) demonstrate the ability of the candidate vaccine to induce a durable immune response in mice; and 3) demonstrate the cross-protective efficacy of the candidate vaccine in mice upon NWAV challenge. Hawaii Biotech and the Baylor College of Medicine will collaborate to develop, evaluate and advance this novel trivalent NWAV vaccine candidate. The development of a cross-protective recombinant subunit vaccine to protect against all three pathogenic NWAVs would provide a valuable medical countermeasure to safeguard against the considerable threat posed by these encephalitic alphaviruses.",  ,,,,DAVID E CLEMENTS,,8087921303,clements@hibiotech.com,,  ,

The United States is experiencing a major mental health crisis. Per recent reports in the New
York Times and The Washington Post, the gap between need and access to behavioral health
services is rapidly increasing. There is an urgent need to solve both the access and quality
problems with behavioral healthcare. With COVID and other stressors, 76% of surveyed
employees are reporting at least one significant behavioral health symptom and 27% believe
their employer is not doing enough to assist their family with their anxiety, depression, and other
behavioral health issues. Another report indicated that adults are on wait lists for 3+ months to
receive outpatient therapy in Massachusetts. There simply are not enough therapists to meet
the growing demand and waiting lists are long and growing. On the quality side, more than 60%
of patients find no meaningful benefit from the treatment they receive. We have already created
a system that dramatically improved the quality problem in a randomized clinical trial: this
referral process roughly doubled network outcomes for the primary referral channel for the
Cleveland Clinic, improving outcomes compared to a control group where cases were assigned
based on therapists self-perceived strengths. In the current application we aim to solve the
access problem by developing Consumer-Therapist-Connector. This innovative online tool will
expeditiously connect patients with well-matched therapists for traditional therapy by distance
search, or telemedicine by state or national searches. What distinguishes our solution from
other online find-a-therapist systems is that the patient can be easily added to the waitlist of all
empirically well-matched providers, which increases the likelihood they will connect quickly with
a good-fitting therapist. It will alleviate the growing anguish patients encounter when calling
numerous providers only to learn that their practices are full. At the same time, these waiting
lists will dramatically increase the opportunity to use our proven matching technology to
simultaneously improve quality, encouraging consumers and providers to offer and accept
appointments only when a match is likely to greatly benefit the patient.",  ,,,,DAVID R KRAUS,,(508) 834-7323,dkraus@outcomereferrals.com,,  ,

HBV infection affects nearly 350 million people worldwide. Chronic HBV infection is a major risk factor for the development of severe liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, which has a poor survival rate. Current therapies are effective at suppressing viral replication. However, they do not eliminate the virus due to their inability to eliminate the plasmid-like episome, covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) which can serve as a template for the continuous generation of infectious viruses. This cccDNA, which resides in the host nucleus, is generated from relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA), a partially double- stranded DNA found in circulating virions and transmitted into the host hepatocytes. The need to remove cccDNA to cure HBV infection has prompted drug discovery groups to focus efforts on developing compounds that can target and eliminate cccDNA. Even with the ongoing development of novel drugs, there is still an absence of a quantitative, specific, and reliable cccDNA assay that is both highly sensitive for the detection of cccDNA in the blood, as well as being specific enough to not detect rcDNA. The goal of this SBIR is to develop an innovative and sensitive cccDNA assay that would be suitable for routine testing by physicians to manage patients with chronic HBV infection and facilitate anti-HBV drug development. We have designed such an assay, and our preliminary studies have indicated specific detection of 1,000 copies of cccDNA and no detectable amplification of 10,000 copies of rcDNA. Two aims are proposed in this phase I application. Aim 1 is to develop an innovative quantitative PCR assay that has a sensitivity of 0.1% of cccDNA to rcDNA.

The current primer takes damage from the persistent abrasion applied by the tensioner hook, making the underlying steel more susceptible to corrosion and wear. This directly results in an increased maintenance burden on the Navy. Due to the sheer quantity and critical function of these components, it is critical to develop and extended life tie-down to increase U.S. carrier fleet surge-readiness. In Phase I, Mainstream Engineering demonstrated an electroplated, nano-reinforced coating with a 44% reduction in wear rate. The coating was successfully applied to both planar and curved surfaces, and showed equivalent corrosion resistance to the current polyamide epoxy coating. The Phase II Base will focus on optimizing the coating conditions, designing plating systems for coating complex components, and developing a welding procedure for the coated tie-down. In the Phase II Option I, we will increase the plating scale, demonstrate tie-down installation, and determine alternate penetration points for the technology.

Development of GenomeBuild as a Universal Method to Synthesize GenomesOpportunity Number: RFA-HG-20-016PIs: Christopher L. Warren and Mary S. Ozers
Synthetic biology encompasses the ability to de novo synthesize and assemble large oligonucleotides into
genomes of whole organisms, with a broad range of applications in medicine, therapeutics, environmental
sciences, and human genomics. However, the ability to realize the full potential of synthetic biology has been
hampered by the time and cost limitations of building synthetic genomes and large mammalian chromosomes
using current techniques. Additionally, there is no cost effective method to introduce extensive genetic edits
into genomes. The “Design-Build-Test-Learn-Repeat” approach is fundamental to synthetic biology but the
inability to “Build” quickly or cost-effectively inhibits our ability to “Learn,” much less “Repeat.” Furthermore,
with affordability, a diverse array of researchers can be included in this process, not only the most highly
funded laboratories and companies, to propel the field forward and maximize its gains. The ability to custom-
design an entire genome cannot be done with current genomic editing techniques such as CRISPR, and solid-
state synthesis methods on the genome scale are too expensive. In this proposal, we detail a novel method,
GenomeBuild, to inexpensively and rapidly synthesize a high fidelity and completely customizable viral
genome from a standard DNA microarray. As proof-of-principle, we will synthesize a modified form of the 150
kb HSV-1 genome that reproduces the genetic alterations designed in talimogene laherparepvec (TVEC).
TVEC, marketed under the brand name Imlygic™, is the first FDA approved oncolytic virus used for the
treatment of advanced melanoma. Although DNA microarrays can serve as a direct and inexpensive source for
a complex library of oligonucleotides, their high error-rate relative to solid phase synthesis have precluded their
effective use in synthetic biology. Our technology will circumvent this problem by harnessing an unprecedented
high-density peptide nucleic acid (PNA) array to remove imperfect DNA sequences obtained from a
corresponding DNA microarray. Our aims will synthesize high-fidelity microarray-extracted genomic
oligonucleotides that can be assembled into a modified viral genome with less than one error per 75 kb of
sequence on average. Finally, this custom genome will be introduced into a cell line using standard protocols
and assessed for infectivity as compared to a genetically equivalent non-synthesized virus. The inexpensive
cost and fast turnaround time of our GenomeBuild platform will allow production of rt100 kb synthetic
oligonucleotides at a significant time and cost savings compared to commercially available products. Upon
successful development, the GenomeBuild technology can be extrapolated from these efforts to additional
organisms such as other viruses and bacteria with larger genomic sizes, making synthetic biology of whole
genomes, and human chromosomes, more attainable for any laboratory.",  ,,,,CHRISTOPHER L WARREN,,(608) 335-7294,cwarren@proteovista.com,,  ,

This project seeks to demonstrate that our promising newtransgenic tree crop can be commercialized to achieve these goals. We use an innovative proprietytechnology (EliteTreeTM) to genetically engineer superior tree crops that feature both acceleratedstem growth and increased wood density. Deploying these trees in Short Rotation Coppiceplantations has the potential to produce a consistent supply of woody biomass feedstock that willovercome existing economic environmental and social obstacles.

PI: Agenor Mafra-Neto PhDField 7 Project Summary/AbstractThis project will develop novel control solutions for a key crucifer pest diamondback moth(DBM) Plutella xylostella. ISCA will develop two DBM control strategies:Acttra Plutella alure containing a blend of crucifer plant extracts to draw adult moths to traps for a pesticide-freemass trapping strategy; and Acttra Plutella A&K (attract-and-kill) a sprayable formulationblending Acttra Plutella with small amounts of killing agents designed for application to or amongcrops. Crucifer crops which have an estimated US market of >$1 billion are attacked by multipleinsect pests but the most widespread and impactful of these is DBM which attacks nearly allcrucifer crops including broccoli kale cabbage Brussels sprouts canola rapeseed and mustards.Worldwide DBM has an estimated impact of US$4-5 billion including crop damage and controlcosts. Acttra Plutella mass trapping and A&K strategies will be of great value for organicproduction systems where broad-spectrum pesticides cannot be used; and in conventional cruciferproduction where DBM's capacity for resistance has undermined the efficacy of pesticide sprays.DBM resistance has been reported to nearly 100 insecticide active ingredients (AIs) includingorganophosphates benzoylureas avermectins pyrethroids carbamates spinosyns and diamides.Preliminary field trials in Mexican kale farms showed that traps baited with a prototype ActtraPlutella blend captured high numbers of DBM and an A&K prototype containing the same cruciferextracts attracted and killed large numbers of DBM moths. Trials with Africanized honeybees inBrazil demonstrated that the formulation had no attractancy to the bees indicating that applicationsof Acttra Plutella in crop fields would do no harm to pollinator populations. Phase I research anddevelopment on Acttra Plutella and Acttra Plutella A&K will build on these successes byoptimizing the Acttra Plutella lure determining optimal trap placement and density and assessingits impact when blended with insecticide as an A&K technique. Phase I will consist of five tasks:1) dose response trials to evaluate the effects of sequential dilutions of the original formulation onDBM trap capture and A&K efficacy; 2) field studies with the best-performing formulation fromTask 1 to assess the comparative efficacy of mass trapping using different trap densities in thefield; 3) A&K trials assessing Acttra Plutella A&K's impact on DBM populations and cropdamage; 4) rain simulation trials to assess Acttra Plutella's persistence under rainfall; and 5)stakeholder involvement in problem identification and implementation of results. Phase II studieswill focus on further optimization of Acttra Plutella using mass trapping and A&K techniquestailoring the former to the needs of organic growers while the latter product will be marketed toconventional growers empowering reliable production of brassicas with reduced reliance onconventional pesticides. Acttra Plutella A&K will also be designed to be blended with toxicantsusing multiple distinct modes of action minimizing the risk of resistance.Successful development of Acttra Plutella and Acttra Plutella A&K will bring effective andsustainable pest management technologies to the market and will help to reduce the need forpesticide use in crucifer production and consequently decrease the health and environmental risksassociated with overuse of these toxic chemicals. The US and international market for ISCA'sActtra Plutella technologies are large as DBM is recognized as the most damaging crucifer pestin the world and has developed resistance to virtually all pesticides used to control it creatingenormous opportunities for alternative,  ,,,,AGENOR  MAFRA-NETO,,(951) 686-5008,president@isca.com,,  ,

However, the current state of drone control requires an operator to have their head down and hands tied to a manual vehicle controller at all times which affects situational awareness (SA) and ultimately operator security. New forms of Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and human-machine teaming technology provided in this SBIR could greatly free up battlespace awareness of UxS operators of the future who will need to control drones swarms, complex behaviors, and dynamic retasking. The primary objective of the proposed Phase II effort is to prototype, conduct testing, and evaluate (T&E) a unified HMI which is able to integrate a wide variety of wearable controllers and 3D visualization displays on a diverse number of Ground Control Stations (GCS) in order to enhance the UxS warfighter experience and improve CONOP success rates. The solution will provide a clear path for wearable companies to integrate with various GCS which are used by MARSOC and NSW, starting with Tomahawk Robotics Kinesis and QGroundControl (QGC). The primary effort is to develop consistent, synergistic displays which run on Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) and End User Devices (EUDs) for UxS Command and Control (C2). Market research, end user evaluations, and demonstrations will be shown of the Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs). This differentiation of the GUI is that it can be contextualized to specific CONOPs and wearable combinations for ISR CONOPs with a roadmap for intelligent automation to enhance the UxS operator experience.

Meatproducts decompose naturally because of high fat and water contents that render them susceptibleto spoilage by both lipid oxidation and microbial contamination. The spoiled meat is hazardous dueto microbial growth and the subsequent transmission of food borne illnesses. Food packaging is oneof the main processes to preserve the quality of food products for transportation storage and enduse. Currently there is a rapidly growing demand by consumers and manufacturers for smart foodquality monitoring solutions to (i) detect sense and record deterioration inside the food packageand (ii) ensure the safety preserve quality and warn about possible problems during food transportand storage. These smart strategies help to increase the food products shelf-life by real-time qualitymonitoring thereby improving the profitability to manufacturers and supermarkets and reducing thecost of food products for consumers.We propose to develop and commercialize a low-cost clip-based add-on system that utilizes theavailable camera in a smartphone to create a high-performance multispectral imager (MSI). Ourproposed add-on utilizes a custom developed 9-position electronic filter wheel with Bluetoothconnectivity that works with our custom image processing application that can be downloaded freeof cost.

Current therapies for sickle cell disease largely fail to meet patient needs, particularly for the management of
acute pain crisis associated with this devastating disease. Healthcare systems are largely ill-equipped for
managing patients in the midst of these extremely painful and life-threatening events, leaving patients with
medical distrust and no effective treatment option. We are therefore developing IHP-100 for at-home self-
management of pain crisis, thus empowering patients and providing significant freedom from disease. IHP-100
is a novel P-selectin and complement inhibitor that is administered by subcutaneous injection at the onset of
early symptoms of pain crisis. This is a major paradigm shift in care that builds on our recent understanding of
sickle cell pathology and incorporates direct patient feedback to provide a truly effective treatment.
IHP-100 is a novel glycan-based therapeutic, designed to target the key underlying pathology of vaso-occlusive
crisis (VOC). VOC is multi-factorial and includes both cellular adhesion via selectins as well as complement
activation. Glycans are a prime drug class for such complex pathologies given their pleiotropic activities. We
have therefore engineered IHP-100 as a single agent that potently inhibits P-selectin as well as complement.
IHP-100 is therefore highly differentiated both in its biological activity and in its treatment paradigm at the earliest
symptom of pain crisis.
We have shown that IHP-100 inhibits P-selectin mediated cell binding to inflamed endothelium, inhibits
complement-mediated cell lysis, and reduces vaso-occlusions in the Townes sickle cell disease mouse model
of VOC. In the proposed work, we will optimize the dose level for in vivo efficacy, transfer manufacturing and
analytical testing to a GMP facility, and complete non-clinical IND enabling dose-range finding studies. We will
also further investigate mechanisms of IHP-100 in a P-selectin-deficient Townes sickle cell mouse model, and
establish an adhesion-based biomarker strategy for clinical development.",  ,,,,JOHN  PADERI,,(513) 289-1727,jpaderi@ihptherapeutics.com,,  ,

Characterized most notably by involuntary facial movements such as grimacing, involuntary lip, mouth, and tongue movements, and eye blinking, TDD is difficult to treat and potentially irreversible. Psychiatrists and other mental health professionals are acutely aware of the impairment and disability experienced by patients who develop TDD. Early detection of TDD is critical so that appropriate interventions can be instituted. What interventions are implemented is intimately tied to knowing the patient’s medication adherence. It is difficult for the most qualified diagnosticians to devote the 20-25 minutes of in-person time at the 4 to 6 times per year frequency necessary to provide every patient the 1) “active monitoring,” 2) discussion of results, 3) changes to medication and instructions expected with the urgent demands on every mental health professional today. This is increasingly challenging with the increase in telemedicine and patient populations and decreasing human resources due to the pandemic. Unfortunately, despite professionals’ best efforts, it is often too late in the process and the involuntary movements are permanent. Currently, there are 200,000 individuals taking anti-TDD medications costing $60K and $105K annually and this is increasing rapidly each year. A method for automatic TDD detection and accurate adherence would enable timely intervention and avoid patient stigma, lower quality of life, and expensive ongoing treatment for permanent TDD. Antipsychotic prescriptions exceeded 50 million in 2020 and the reported prevalence of TDD is between 13% and 24%. Risk grows with advancing age, off-label uses, and chronic exposure to antipsychotics. Therefore, prevention and early detection are key to managing TDD. However, current methods for monitoring patients require observation of patients at infrequent in-person visits or self-reporting by vigilant but undertrained patients and their families. Therefore, strong market potential exists for an automated remote adherence monitoring and TDD detection system. Our go-to-market strategy is presented in the commercialization plan. This Phase II project proposes to leverage existing telepsychiatry and video interview data gathering technologies that in Phase I demonstrated up to 77% discrimination in categorizing individuals with TDD compared to a 3- person panel of trained clinical professionals evaluating the same video materials. Based on a power analysis of the Phase I data, we propose here to extend collection and analysis of an additional 300 video recorded AIMS and 5-minute video interviews with individuals taking anti-psychotic medications. Half of the interviews will be with individuals living with diagnosed TDD and the other without a diagnosis of TDD. The participants in the study will be recruited to ensure an equal distribution of females and males as well as an ethnically and racially representative sample. The proposed data gathering strategy will provide the source material necessary to finalize and deploy a powerful supervised machine learning derived video and audio analysis tool to detect TDD. The detection tool will be created using 80% of the collected video data as a training set and validated on the remaining 20% reserved as the control set. Based on industry experience with other supervised machine learning training sets and the amount of data to be collected, we set a goal of a 90% success rate in identifying TDD positive and TDD negative participants in the control set. Once the detection tool is complete the project will conclude by incorporating access to the tool into an existing smartphone app, iRxReminder, that is used for data gathering and monitoring of medication adherence, the other critical component required for clinical intervention. The iRxReminder platform links patients directly to researchers and their electronic records. The modified app will be tested in the laboratory to ensure the interface can be easily used. This Phase II project will then use the iRxReminder platform for use in supporting the self- management and TDD and other symptoms monitoring of medication taking by individuals living with chronic mental illnesses. With feasibility established in Phase I, we propose a six-month long clinical trial where participants will 1) be monitored for early detection of TDD (and confirmation of not having TDD, thus avoiding unnecessary diagnostician time) along with 2) goals for high adherence, 3) improved control of symptoms and side effects, and 4) more aggressive and frequent treatment responses by the healthcare team. Statistical tests of the ease-of-use by patients and the care team will be conducted. The impact on revenue, treatment trajectory (number of side effects detected and medication changes made) will be assessed. The success of the algorithm to detect TDD compared to a human assessment at the end of 6-months of monitoring will be a final field test of the technology.",  ,,,,ANTHONY  STERNS,,3306066675,asterns@irxreminder.com,,  ,

Compared to daily multiple insulin injections, pancreatic islet transplantation for type 1 diabetes
(loss of β-cells) or the latter stages of type 2 diabetes (β-cells fail to produce sufficient insulin)
provides a near physiologic regulation of normal blood glucose levels and significantly improves
quality of life by minimizing severe hypoglycemia and diabetic complications. However, a
shortage of donors, loss of allograft function over time, and the need for lifelong
immunosuppression must be resolved before this approach can be widely adopted. The overall
goal of this proposal is to improve islet transplantation using a native extracellular matrix (ECM)-
based culture system, which mimics the pancreatic microenvironment, to obtain large quantities
of high-quality islets with attenuated immunogenicity. Previously, we reported that culture of rat
pancreatic islets on native ECM, produced by bone marrow stromal cells, promoted growth of islet
vascular endothelial cells (VECs), production of islet-bm associated proteins, improvement of β-
cell function, and attenuation of islet immunogenicity (Appendix 1). Recently, we developed an
ECM synthesized by human amniotic fluid (AF)-derived pluripotent stem cells. Proteomic analysis
suggested that the protein composition of AF-ECM and pancreatic ECM were similar and this was
validated in our preliminary studies. Moreover, human islets maintained on AF-ECM showed
significantly improved insulin secretion in response to glucose stimulation. Here, we propose to
explore AF-ECM, a surrogate pancreatic-like ECM (pI-ECM), for potential use in maintaining
human islets. We will prepare pl-ECM employing Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and
hypothesize that maintenance of islets on pl-ECM, prepared using GMP compliant conditions,
will facilitate the recovery of large numbers of high-quality human islets with decreased
immunogenicity. To test this hypothesis, we will manufacture pl-ECM with reagents and facilities
that are GMP compliant and then compare its architecture, mechanical properties, and protein
composition with our current research use only (RUO) version (Aim 1). We will also compare the
viability, function and immunogenicity of human islets maintained on GMP-compliant versus RUO-
pl-ECM (Aims 2and3). If the proposed work is successful, it will provide the necessary preliminary
data and rationale for moving forward with a small-scale clinical trial and commercialize a new,
GMP-grade version of our matrix product for use in the manufacture of cell products for clinical
applications.",  ,,,,ANNE E SHELDRAKE,,(210) 877-9323,anne.sheldrake@stembiosys.com,,  ,

SARS-CoV-2 is genetically related to the previous two coronaviruses that caused human outbreaks in the 21st century, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Even though COVID-19 mortality is lower than the other two coronavirus diseases, the pandemic has impacted, by mid-April 2022, >500 million people worldwide, and caused >6 million deaths. Had the COVID-19 mortality been closer to those of SARS and MERS, the impact of the current pandemic would be incomparably more catastrophic. The need for cold storage, the requirement for boosters, and the potential for adverse allergic reactions, are major drawbacks of current COVID-19 vaccines. To address these shortcomings, we propose to generate a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine that is stable at room temperature, requires only one injection, thus being more practical to deploy nationally and globally during vaccination campaigns, and is less prone to cause hypersensitivity reactions. We plan to conduct this Proof-of- Concept study over a 24-month period with a multidisciplinary team of engineers, molecular virologists, and immunologists. Our overarching goal is to double nanoencapsulate the mRNA molecule that encodes the coronavirus Spike protein in phospholipid nanosomes and then into biodegradable polymer nanospheres to sustain mRNA release. We will characterize the antigenicity and integrity of the nanoencapsulated mRNA before and after nanoencapsulation and coating and determine the best process conditions that ensure stability at room temperature after lyophilization. We will also evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of the nanoencapsulated antigen and perform challenge studies in two animal models, in anticipation of subsequent clinical studies. Based on these studies, we will select the best nanoformulation for scale-up, more detailed characterization, establish potency and release specifications, and regulatory studies in Phase II.",  ,,,,TREVOR P CASTOR,,7819326933,tcastor@aphios.com,,  ,

As illustrated in Fig. 1, our proprietary battery-powered 2.45-GHz transmitting antenna is capable of doing seemingly impossible things: sending video signals from inside a locked -90-dB isolation COTS Faraday cage. This novel capability may be used for improving Wi-Fi connectivity in dense urban environments and underground facilities, such as man-made tunnels and natural caves, as well as remote examination of metal enclosures (such as shipping containers, etc.). In particular, it may be used to provide practical wireless communications which will greatly outperform traditional free-space radio frequency (RF) communications in subterranean environments during DoD missions. It is widely acknowledged that traditional wireless communications links (both RF and non-RF) suffer a number of impairments when used in subterranean spaces. On the other hand, while above-ground free space radio links are well understood, RF propagation underground is not well studied. In particular, only very recently it was recognized that radio frequency surface electromagnetic waves (plasmons) may propagate underground along the boundaries of media having strongly different electric conductivity. Examples of such boundaries may include metal-soil, clay-cement and many other interfaces which are typically found in subterranean environments during DoD missions. Our preliminary experiments indicate that utilization of radio frequency plasmons will considerably improve radio link performance in subterranean environments via improved plasmonic propagation around tunnel curvatures, corners, intersections, and discontinuities. Development of field-proven plasmonic radios proposed by Saltenna will enable DoD missions in subterranean environments, which require the real-time exchange of substantial amounts of information such as voice, video, and sensor data among personnel, sensors, and robotic systems.

very large cost burdens. In addition, the total burden of fractures in the US is growing due to the aging of the
population and increases in osteoporosis. Some of these fractures do not heal properly, largely due to infections
resulting in high additional costs and morbidity in this subset of patients. Also, open fractures, often caused by
trauma, can lead to a very high rate of infection (20-30%), which might result in nonunion or amputation even
with the best of care. Reducing this significant burden to both the quality of life of the patients affected and to
the US public health and health systems is a very significant need. Bisphosphonates (BPs) are a class of
therapeutic compounds used to treat bone resorptive disorders, and accumulate in bone with exceptionally high
affinity, which makes them an excellent moiety for a novel bone targeted drug delivery platform.BioVinc is a company founded to be a leader in bone related diseases and has an extensive amount of
preliminary data showing the feasibility of using novel bone targeted bisphosphonate conjugated fluoroquinolone
compounds as a treatment for bone fracture healing problems. In this FastTrack SBIR proposal we will move the
BioVinc solution for infected delayed/non-union fracture toward commercial use. Our plan is to identify the ideal
clinical development candidate and complete the necessary nonclinical studies in order to advance our lead to
the stage of IND enabling studies to support IND application for first in human safety trials. In order to determine
the optimal doses of the conjugates and to get an initial safety assessment of the pharmacokinetics and
toxicology, studies will be conducted to confirm the opportunity for a development pathway. Specifically, we will
carry out two phases with four aims: Phase I Aim One. Improve synthesis of the BP-fluoroquinolone lead
compound to demonstrate that scale up to commercial quantities will be feasible; Phase I Aim Two. Carry out
initial pharmacokinetic studies in the mini pig to demonstrate skeletal exposure in the animal to be used for
pivotal IND enabling efficacy studies; Phase II Aim One. Further improve synthetic methodology to allow the
preparation of the BP-fluoroquinolone at the 50-100 gram scale to provide material to support efficacy studies in
mini pig and develop the process chemistry for large scale synthesis of the lead compound transferable to kg
GMP production with preliminary salt and polymorph screening; Phase II Aim Two. Test the lead compound for
its efficacy in the mini pig model of surgical repair of fractures.Successful completion of the proposed work will provide the preclinical data necessary to commercialize
our innovative product for use in infected fractures. This will meet a significant unmet medical need to reduce
the morbidity and mortality associated with poor healing, multiple surgeries, relapse, and extended hospital stays

There are a large variety of individual optimization tools available, based on techniques from Operations Research (OR), Constraint Programming (CP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Multi-agent Systems (MAS) etc., but there is no wholly satisfactory framework for tying these point solutions into overall solutions that are (approximately) optimal. In Phase I we developed our HI-DE-HO (HIerarchical DistributEd Heterogenous Optimization) framework for solving distributed optimization problems.  HI-DE-HO combined developments from OR, CP, AI, and MAS. We showed how to decompose task-allocation optimization problems across a network of agents, and provide solutions guaranteed to achieve a fixed proportion of theoretical optimality. We demonstrated our technique using an abstract version of the Master Air Attack Plan (MAAP) problem, and evaluated it both analytically and empirically, showing that a distributed, hierarchical solution provides a guaranteed proportion of the theoretically optimal achievable quality, while providing feasible solutions much more efficiently.  In Phase II, we propose to expand our developments into a prototype system for distributed Air Force mission planning, building on a new domain-independent library for Distributed Hierarchical and Heterogeneous Mission Planning and Scheduling, and with enhanced algorithms for full-scale, real-world problems.  ",Zola  Donovan,,(312) 587-2166,zola.donovan@us.af.mil,Robert  Goldman,,(612) 326-3934,smith@kestreltechnology.com,"University of Maryland, College Park",Danette  Boone,(301) 405-8108

Sepsis is the leading cause of in-hospital mortality, where one in three inpatient deaths are due to sepsis. Incidence of sepsis has been increasing with 1.7 million sepsis cases and 270,000 deaths per year. Early identification of deterioration has been shown to reduce the need for patient transfer to higher care units, reduce lengths of stay, and improve survival rates. Each hour of delay in ICU admission has been associated with a 1.5% increased risk of ICU death and a 1% increase in risk of hospital death. Many studies support that there is an increase in mortality rate for every hour delay in antibiotics. Pairing patient risk stratification with appropriate levels of hospital intervention is essential to reduce risk of mortality. Patients in intermediate units between the levels of monitoring found in floor units and ICUs are especially difficult to predict possibility of condition deterioration. Automated monitoring, alerts, and trend analysis are essential to identifying and proactively intervening patients under duress. Current methods of monitoring patient health have low specificity and have significant room for improvement.  This project will develop Deep-CDS, a cloud-based deep learning system for context-sensitive clinical decision support in monitoring and predicting the deterioration of patient health and progression of sepsis risk factors in real-time to improve outcomes and optimize the management of care across the hospital population.

It produces a pseudo/GPS signal to enable continued operation of on/board GPS/based system elements with an architecture that enables mission/specific aiding sources. ASEI specializes in navigation solutions and missiles and has experience with the SOPGM Common Launch Tube (CLT) and the Battle Management Systems (BMS). ASEI’s proposed solution uses the Mission Computer and Autopilot (MCAP), a navigation and guidance system for low SWAP applications.

Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) has demonstrated
tremendous potential for treatment of advanced solid tumors. Objective response rates ranging from 34 to 72%
have been reported in patients with metastatic melanoma, with durable, complete tumor regression observed in
up to 20% of treated patients. However, the current process for isolating, identifying, and expanding therapeutic
TIL cells was established more than 30 years ago. TILs are stimulated with a murine anti-CD3 monoclonal
antibody (OKT-3), high concentration of recombinant IL-2 produced from E. coli, and irradiated allogeneic or
autologous feeder cells. Shortcomings of this process include the need for a surgically resectable tumor as a
source of TIL cells, inability to grow TILs for a significant portion of patients, significant presence of regulatory T
cells, and long production time. Moreover, TILs are predominantly differentiated into “old” effector T cells in vitro
with a terminal phenotype, thereby reducing their long-term survival and antitumor effectiveness in vivo. Younger
phenotype T cells, including stem cell memory and central memory T cells, provide superior persistence and
antitumor immunity compared with effector memory T cells and effector T cells. This is consistent with recent
clinical findings by Dr. Rosenberg and his group that the response of TILs against human cancer is primarily
mediated by neoantigen-specific and stem-like CD8+ T cells (CD39-CD69-).Moreover, there is a high unmet
need for rapidly progressing cancer types where the window of treatment is limited and where the time for TIL
These shortcomings can be surmounted by improving the
antibodies and cytokines used ex vivo and optimizing the combination and manufacturing process to robustly
and rapidly produce TIL cells, thus, enabling TIL treatment for a broad spectrum of solid tumor patients with
higher response rate and curative potential.

We have been using stably transfected HEK293 cells to produce proprietary antibodies and cytokines. These
ancillary materials are critical in TIL manufacturing but are not intended to be part of the final cell product.
O
ur
innovative products for TIL cell production as ex vivo therapeutics have demonstrated striking advantages over
current commercial products for TIL production by improving the culture success rate, absolute expansion
number, fitness and, critically, shortening the duration of TIL manufacturing while minimizing regulatory T cells.
W
e have formed a strategic partnership to rigorously evaluate the products and optimize the manufacturing
process of TILs. Currently,
TILs have been successfully cultured from small tissues of 60 pancreatic and 20 non-
pancreatic tumors and
scaled up using the Cocoon® Platform (Lonza) for pancreatic tumors, the most difficult
TILs to grow so far. Critically, the TILs manufactured in clinical scale has a high frequency of CD8+CD39-
CD69- T cells and the reactivities of TILs against neo-antigens were robustly detected by IFN release. The data
obtained thus far show a focused, yet diverse TCR repertoire. In addition to a more general TCR analysis in TIL,
we were able to link individual TCR clonotypes to individual private target antigens and to trace these back to
the TIL product and to the corresponding harvested tumor tissue, respectively.Specific Aim. To determine whether anti-CD137HC and/or IL-12HC enriches antigen-specific T cells and anti-
TGFHC, anti-IL-6HC and/or anti-IL-23HC blunts Th17 differentiation and IL-17 release; select top Expi293 cell
clones and complete pilot scale production of proprietary antibodies and cytokines critical for TIL manufacturing.The strategic collaborator will validate the efficacy and consistency of our products and pursue regulatory
clearance for clinical manufacturing of TILs from pancreatic patients. Importantly, a Phase 1 clinical trial for
metastatic or recurrent pancreatic cancer patients has been planned, the first patient is anticipated to be enrolled

Project Summary/Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for eHealth interventions that target families and children at-
risk of family violence and long-term mental health problems. Escalating rates of anxiety and depression during
COVID-19 have impacted families adversely, and have led to impaired parent-child relationships and increased
family conflict (Russell et al., 2020). These risks are exacerbated by increases in mental health problems and
limited access to social support and treatment (Taylor et al., 2021). The challenges of parenting coupled with
increases in stress and violence during COVID-19 have accelerated the need for treatments that target these
problems. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has widened the gap between families who have services
and support and those who do not, increasing health disparities in this population. As such, we have developed
the Family Check-Up Online to support families and children by improving family relationships and mental
health. The FCU Online has the potential to reduce health disparities by providing an accessible, easily
disseminated version of the FCU to families at-risk of adverse outcomes after COVID-19. A recent and timely
systematic review of telehealth therapy for families suggest that they are equally effective as in-person
treatments, and improve both parent mental health and child outcomes (McClean et al., 2021), supporting the
use of eHealth approaches for mental health intervention. In the proposed application, we will examine the
feasibility and commercial potential of the FCU Online by interviewing key stakeholders in schools and school-
based mental health settings. We propose to improve the back-end structure of the FCU Online, which was
previously developed as part of a clinical trial, to support wide-scale commercialization of the product including
flexible module delivery, progress monitoring, and self-enrollment. We will test the product with a series of
stakeholder focus groups and usability testing to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the product for
commercialization. In Phase II, we plan to develop and test e-learning models for coach training as well as
evaluate the product in a clinical trial to examine the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and
maintenance of the program in real-world settings. Our team includes experts in implementation and
dissemination, evidence-based interventions for at-risk families, business development and marketing, and
product development. Letters of support from community and school providers demonstrate our strong

The success of SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) in the primary care setting has been inconsistent in terms of patients following through on treatment referral recommendations, with averages as low as 10%. For a variety of reasons, many patients, irrespective of their specific disease, do not adhere well to clinical recommendations. One way to improve adherence has been to personalize the recommendations for each individual’s needs, especially using digital technology, such as apps. The aim of NIDA to develop a sophisticated smart phone based tool for improving patient follow up to SBIRT recommendations is therefore well justified. CHESS Health has already developed an automated digital tool (eIntervention) with key elements requested by this RFA. eIntervention is designed to encourage patient adherence to PCP recommendations following SBIRT. Using a variety of the RFA required functionalities, eIntervention is designed to facilitate and motivate each patient to enter treatment, once that patient has been identified by SBIRT as having a substance use disorder (SUD) or as being at risk of such. eIntervention is commercially available and was developed in response to customer requests. However, eIntervention does not contain all of the functionalities requested by NIDA in this RFA and we do not have data to validate efficacy. Such validation is important for supporting wide spread dissemination. We propose to enhance our existing eIntervention solution with new functionalities that address the requirements set forth in this RFA and carry out a randomized study of efficacy. In Phase I, our Specific Aim is to evaluate feasibility of our program for improving adherence to SBIRT recommendations to patients from PCPs. This Specific Aim will be accomplished in two Tasks: Task 1: Add functionality to our prototype that address most requirements outlined in the RFA. Task 2: Demonstrate acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the prototype eIntervention in improving patient linkage to and engagement in indicated follow-up specialty SUD care. If shown to be feasible, in Phase II, our Specific Aim is to evaluate a near commercial quality product that contains all of the features required by the RFA. The Specific Aim will be accomplished in two Tasks: Task 1: Modifications to the program (months 1-3). Task 2: The randomized clinical trial to test efficacy of SBIRT/eIntervention compared to SBIRT/TAU. Criteria for Success: We aim to double the current rate of follow-up specialty SUD care (e.g. go from ~17% to an achieved rate of ~35%), a highly impactful effect. All patients, including those identified as at risk, must show a reduction in substance use. Patients and PCPs must rank the program with an average of 3.5 on a five-point Likert scale for usability, satisfaction, and willingness to use with the program again.",  ,,,,HANS  MOREFIELD,,9147724031,hmorefield@chess.health,,  ,

This has led to the institution of screening programs with low-dose CT, resulting in ~1.6 million pulmonary nodules detected every year, most of them (~80%) in the periphery of the lung. Tissue biopsy is the standard of care for establishing a definitive diagnosis for treatment planning. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) of tissue biopsies in the procedure room by cytopathologists or cytotechnicians can be used to establish that:  1. Diagnostic quality tissue has been procured; identifying malignancy by ROSE has been  shown to reduce the number of biopsy tools and repeat procedures  2. An adequate number of cells have been obtained to allow molecular profiling by next-  generation sequencing and molecular testing  3. The absence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes justifies the more-invasive  peripheral biopsy. Nevertheless, ROSE is not the standard of care despite its advantages, because its quality is highly variable across sites, it can increase procedure times, and its costs are unlikely to be fully reimbursed. We propose the development of an FDA-cleared medical device that allows microscopic imaging of fresh, unprocessed tissue biopsies in the treatment room and provides accurate, near real-time diagnosis based on deep learning. Specifically, the proposed system uses Stimulated Raman Histology (SRH), which was pioneered by the PI, translated for intraoperative diagnosis in brain tumors, shown to be suitable for automated diagnosis via deep learning with a performance that is non-inferior to pathologists, and resulted in the first CE-certified device for identification of brain tumor margins by the company. Here, we address an urgent clinical need in lung cancer, giving doctors confidence in their intraoperative decisions, and reducing unnecessary biopsies/procedures for patients and payers. Further, we will investigate the potential to provide accurate intraoperative diagnosis of molecular markers that could enable local delivery of pharmaceuticals, ablation, and other therapies, in the biopsy procedure.",  ,,,,CHRISTIAN  FREUDIGER,,8574139322,christian.freudiger@gmail.com,,  ,

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims at tackling the lack of automation in InSAR processing and improving detection thresholds in InSAR time series analysis. While the technique can potentially measure millimeter-scale changes in deformation over periods of days to years, atmospheric effects can wreak havoc on repeat-pass InSAR interpretation by introducing errors that may mask small surface deformations. These effects, which are fundamentally due to pressure, temperature and relative humidity variations in the troposphere, can lead to errors that are larger than most of the deformation signals of interest. Current algorithms are not suited for automated, large-scale monitoring without a priori data because they require time-consuming manual intervention, and the final product requires exhaustive expert interpretation. Through the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence methods this project aims at: (i) further automating and accelerating the processing of InSAR time series, via the automation of some key sections of the processing pipeline that still rely on extensive and costly human intervention; and (ii) developing a new methodology to generate InSAR time series, that is robust to noise and allows for a finer temporal and spatial resolution compared to the state-of-the-art._x000D_

Corneal disease is one of the leading causes of visual deficiency and blindness, and is considered the second major cause of blindness in developing countries. There are nearly 5 million bilaterally corneal blind persons worldwide, and an estimated 23 million people affected by unilateral corneal blindness globally. In a conservative estimate, corneal diseases affect nearly 300,000 people in the United States, with Fuchs’ dystrophy affecting 4% of people aged over 40. Given the large prevalence of corneal disease and the near-impossibility of performing biopsy, high-definition corneal imaging is needed to assist clinical diagnosis, evaluate progression of diseases, and treatment. Additionally, the cornea is the most commonly transplanted tissue worldwide. Gabor-domain optical coherence microscopy (GDOCM) is a high-resolution, non-invasive imaging technology that can visualize microscopic structures in vivo in 3D. Preliminary data suggest that GDOCM has the following key advantages over existing corneal imaging techniques, which include specular and confocal microscopy: 1) 10-100x increase in field of view – this will lead to more accurate qualification of the corneal tissue, since a larger area can be assessed; 2) simultaneous measure of corneal thickness, quantification of endothelial cell density, as well as identification of morphological variations due to corneal disease – this will lead to full corneal evaluation in one instrument; 3) 3D imaging capability at the cellular level of the mosaic of translucent corneal cells – this will enable a detailed understanding the volumetric progression of the diseases. We have assembled an exceptionally strong team of clinical investigators to collaborate on this proposal, and with their help we have identified four use cases for clinical application of our dual-imaging technology to image the cornea with volumetric cellular-resolution.

Despite the dramatic improvement in outcomes afforded by immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies,
most patients with metastatic BRAF-mutated melanoma ultimately experience progression of their disease. One
key reason for resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors is a paucity of melanoma-specific T cells, but
unfortunately, the majority of early melanoma vaccines meant to expand melanoma-specific T cells have failed
to demonstrate benefit. Next generation sequencing and in silico peptide-HLA binding prediction have allowed
investigators to vaccinate cancer patients against neoantigens – peptides that are not expressed by any normal
tissues but are only found in tumors. Although neoantigen vaccines hold great promise, a key limitation is the
fact that neoantigens are generally private, thus it is not possible to make an “off-the-shelf” neoantigen vaccine
that will be appropriate for a large group of patients. We and others have found that melanoma patients can
mount an endogenous T cell response to a mutated BRAF (valine to glutamic acid at position 600). We have
further demonstrated that an HLA-A2-binding mutated BRAF peptide (mBRAFp) is highly immunogenic in HLA-
A2-transgenic mice. Here we propose that an immunogenic vaccine targeting V600E-mutated BRAF in the
context of HLA-A2 has the potential to expand melanoma-specific T cells. As a shared neoantigen, mBRAFp is
a relevant tumor target for approximately 20-25% of melanoma patients (40- 50% of melanoma patients
harboring BRAF V600E x 50% of patients harboring HLA-A2). This off-the-shelf therapeutic vaccine may be used
as a monotherapy for patients with high-risk resected melanoma or with minimal tumor burden. It may also be
combined with anti-PD-1 for patients with melanoma that is refractory to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy
and targeted therapy. Our vaccine consists of mBRAFp and resiquimod (RSQ) as adjuvant formulated in
CAPRO™ - a new class of proprietary biodegradable liquid polymers, providing local controlled release of both
the antigen and adjuvant. Previously we found that (1) mice vaccinated with ovalbumin (OVA) and RSQ loaded
in CAPRO developed long-lasting OVA-specific antibody and CD8 T cell responses, and (2) CAPRO-loaded
mBRAFp and RSQ elicited antigen-specific T cell response in HLA-A2 transgenic mice. Based on these
promising results, we have initiated preclinical product development program involving CMC of the vaccine
ingredients and formulation development and have received written comments from the FDA in response to our
pre-IND inquiry. The goal of this project is to define the vaccine product and set the stage for full CMC and
pharmacology/toxicology studies toward an IND application. To accomplish this goal, we will first evaluate the
prophylactic and therapeutic antitumor efficacy and safety of our vaccine product in a mBRAFp-expressing HLA-
A2 transgenic mouse model with direct comparison with a formulation using Montanide (a clinically used vaccine
adjuvant system). We will also explore the potential of combining vaccine with immune checkpoint inhibition
(anti-PD1). We will then develop analytical assays for vaccine ingredients and final vaccine product, and
generate IND-enabling data to meet CMC requirements of the FDA.",  ,,,,CHUN  WANG,,(612) 626-3990,wangx504@umn.edu,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,  ,

prised of an inhaled biotherapeutic API for treatment of neutrophilic inflammation and disease progression in
COPD patients. COPD is a chronic degenerative disease that is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S.,
where it predominantly results from tobacco smoke exposure. Acute exacerbations are a sudden worsening of
symptoms that can occur frequently, ≥ 2 per year in severe cases, and can result in reduced lung function,
reduced health status, and increased risk for mortality. Treatment approaches including short- and long-acting
bronchodilators, corticosteroids, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, cytokine blockers, and respiratory stimulants
have been used but with limited clinical efficacy. Inhaled corticosteroids are used specifically to treat inflamma-
tion but have potential for serious side effects, e.g., severe pneumonia and death. Combination therapies have
demonstrated modest reductions in exacerbation frequency, but there is still significant room for improvement,
as these therapeutics do not halt disease progression and often can have serious side effects. Recent research
has demonstrated a strong association between neutrophilic inflammation that results from dysbiosis, i.e., an
altered microbiome, of the lung in COPD. ResBiotic has demonstrated that heightened levels of proteobacteria
can increase expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and neutrophil elastase (NE), which are associ-
ated with neutrophilic inflammation and can cause extracellular matrix degradation and airway remodeling. Res-
Biotic has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that anti-inflammatory Lactobacillus strains can reduce inflammation
resulting from dysbiosis, including the expression of MMP-9 and NE, which may enable highly effective biother-
apeutic drugs for COPD. Commercialization of a Lactobacillus-based biotherapeutic drug would provide an al-
ternative anti-inflammatory approach with a different mechanism of action than currently available therapeutics.
The goal of this proposal will be to develop a biotherapeutic drug that includes non-living components of a Lac-
tobacillus bacterial extract that are responsible for the therapeutic response. Phase I will include screening dif-
ferent cellular components at various dosages to identify several candidates that reduce MMP-9 expression in
primary human bronchial epithelial cells taken from COPD patients. Phase II will include the development of a
dry powder formulation of optimal candidates and safety and efficacy testing in preclinical mouse models of
COPD. The deliverable for Phase II will be a lead candidate that has demonstrated efficacy in reduction of
neutrophilic inflammation and improvements in lung function that is ready to advance to IND-enabling large
mammal studies. Successful commercialization of the inhaled drug product RB1000 is expected to provide an
alternative or complementary treatment modality to the standard of care to address neutrophilic inflammation
resulting from dysbiosis in COPD, which is expected to reduce COPD exacerbations, potentially reduce disease
progression, and improve patient quality of life.",  ,,,,TEODORA  NICOLA,,(251) 610-5375,thea@resbiotic.com,,  ,

Minimally invasive cardio-thoracic approaches, such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), have
recently overtaken traditional surgical methods due to significant reductions in procedural mortality, morbidity,
and improved time to recovery. Transfemoral access of the heart via the femoral artery is the most common
approach for delivery of large bore devices such as heart valves and left ventricular assist devices (LVAD).
Despite improvements in health outcomes through transfemoral percutaneous approaches, large bore catheter
sheaths are used that cannot be inserted safely in approximately 20% of patients because of small vessel diam-
eter, diffuse atherosclerotic disease, or extensive tortuosity. Transcaval access to the heart has emerged as a
new approach to introducing large bore devices into the abdominal aorta, with the donor catheter entering from
the femoral vein and the receiver catheter entering from the radial artery, aligning in the inferior vena cava, and
crossing over to the aorta. It is vastly superior to transfemoral access due to lower pressure and increased
controllability that results from the reduced tortuosity of the venous system, reduced propensity for obstruction,
and large size of the veins. However, transcaval access is technically challenging, requiring multiple fluoroscopic
viewing angles and operators, which limits its use to specialized medical centers.
MagPAD is developing the MagPAD (Magnetic Puncture, Access, and Delivery) device, a cardiac catheter de-
livery system that uses magnets to simplify transcaval access to the heart, for large bore access through the
venous system. The system employs magnets that are embedded in the leading ends of catheters that automat-
ically aligns the catheters and brings the inferior vena cava and aorta closer in 3-dimensional space to simplify
crossover to the aorta. This has potential to substantially reduce the difficulty of the process, as it removes the
variability in time and difficulty in each procedure by eliminating the need for multiple fluoroscopic viewing angles
and potentially multiple operators that are necessary to accurately traverse the guidewire through the snare in
three-dimensions. Prior to this Phase I proposal, MagPAD has developed an early prototype catheter and
demonstrated magnetic auto-alignment in a porcine cadaveric model. The goal of this project will be to develop
a functional prototype and demonstrate feasibility for magnetic alignment, tissue approximation, and guidewire
crossover into the aorta in a live porcine model. Success with these goals will substantially lower the barrier to
adoption for transcaval procedures, expand access to more patients that are unsuitable for transfemoral TAVR,
and improve health outcomes by accessing the heart through the venous system which may reduce vascular
complications and risks of ischemia and stroke across all patients",  ,,,,MARK  DOHERTY,,(781) 258-6151,mark.doherty@hubconsultinggroup.com,,  ,

As weather patterns evolve, rodent populations are affected and may multiply in areas where increased contact with humans results in infection. Hantaviruses, including Andes (ANDV) and Sin Nombre (SNV), are transmitted through the excreta of infected rodents and, when aerosolized, infect humans. In the Americas, hantavirus infection leads to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), a devastating condition that features rapid onset of pulmonary edema, respiratory failure and cardiogenic shock. Treatment is supportive, not pathogen-targeted, and accordingly, approximately 40% of patients do not survive. Because hantaviruses establish lifelong, asymptomatic infections in their rodent reservoirs, they are highly prevalent in nature and represent a constant threat to humans. For example, SNV is carried by the most abundant mammal in North America, the deer mouse, which has a near ubiquitous distribution throughout the US and Canada. In the case of the South American ANDV, in addition to rodent-to-human transmission, human-to-human transmission occurs, putting not only the patient, but also family members and health care workers at risk. Despite this large potential for infection and the high case fatality rate, there are no FDA-approved treatment options or vaccines available. Hantaviruses are thus classified as NIAID Priority Pathogens and considered potential bioterrorism threats. Our long term goal is to develop an effective therapeutic against HCPS-causing hantaviruses. This proposal seeks to develop human neutralizing antibodies for therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of HCPS caused by ANDV. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of molecular virologists, clinicians, and industry partners with experience developing antibody-based therapeutics. The successful development of a potent neutralizing antibody against ANDV has the potential to be a first-line antiviral for the treatment or prevention of HCPS.",  ,,,,JOANA M MURAD,,6173208521,jm@celdaramedical.com,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,  ,

A critical challenge in the early detection is the absence of tools available to pediatric offices to perform quantitative head shape assessment during well-child visits. Delays in diagnosis limit the opportunity for early, less invasive and effective treatment options. In this Fast-track SBIR project, PediaMetrix Inc. has joined forces with pediatric hospitals and providers to develop and evaluate SoftSpotTM, which is the first mobile digital tool for 3D data collection and analysis of infant cranial malformations at the point-of-care.  Head malformations during infancy can be synostotic (i.e., craniosynostosis) or nonsynostotic (such as deformational plagiocephaly and brachycephaly or DPB). Both types of conditions require immediate attention and benefit from early treatment to avoid long-term health complications. The prevalence of DPB increased dramatically in recent years, from 5% to approximately 20%-30%, causing the condition to be called a pediatric epidemic. Craniosynostosis is less common affecting 1 in 2,000 children. To improve the early management of these conditions and to prevent more complex treatment and associated morbidities, it is essential to monitor the growth of the infant head at the point-of-care.  To address this unmet clinical need, under our parent grant, we will develop and evaluate a mobile digital tool that will enable pediatricians to capture and analyze 3D scans of every infant for the early diagnosis and management of cranial malformations. The proposed supplement project will perform market research for the direct to consumer (parents of newborns) as well as business to business (primary pediatric clinics) path for SoftSpot, development of financial projections (pro forma), running a pilot with a channel partner, finding the strategic partners, and improving the product (both technically and regulatory wise) to be ready for launch and scaling.    The overall mission of PediaMetrix is to provide accurate decision support tools for pediatric health at the point-of-care.

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a serious diabetic complication that is the leading cause of vision loss in working-
age adults, affecting more than 7.5 million people in the USA. It causes more new cases of blindness than any
other eye disease in people between the ages of 18 and 65. The anti-VEGF treatments can slow the progress
of DR in many patients but are only used after significant vascular lesions have already developed. These
intraocular antibody injections are expensive, painful, inconvenient for patients and introduce a risk of developing
endophthalmitis. The successful development of an orally administered small molecule therapeutic that protects
the retina at an earlier stage of the disease would represent a significant breakthrough in the clinical management
of this diabetic complication. Praetego Inc. plans to address DR by developing a novel oral medication that may
protect the retina from the damage of hyperglycemia at the earliest stages of the disease. Hyperglycemia is the
key common factor linking all diabetic complications. Direct reaction of proteins with glucose leads to formation
of so-called advanced glycation end products (AGEs), a process accompanied and accelerated by production of
damaging dicarbonyls such as methylglyoxal, reactive oxygen species and free radicals. There is much evidence
implicating AGE formation as a causative factor in all microvascular complications of diabetes. Our project
advances our novel and potent AGE inhibitor, PTG-630, for treating DR, which is demonstrating neuroprotection
in preclinical studies on diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). It avidly binds redox metal ions, especially Cu2+,
which endows it with the additional capacity to be a general antioxidant. PTG-630 has been well characterized
in safety pharmacology and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion), and physical-chemical
properties. This dual-acting small molecule has excellent penetration into the brain and CSF after oral
administration due to its excellent cellular permeability. In preliminary pharmacokinetic studies, we have
confirmed that it quickly reaches the retina, an organ where there is evidence of neurovascular damage
preceding vascular lesions in DR. Thus, in this Phase I proposal, we will test the hypothesis that: orally
administered PTG-630 can prevent retinal neurodegeneration, vision loss and retinal inflammation in STZ-
diabetic rats. Our Specific Aims are: 1) determine the effectiveness of PTG-630 (in its tri-HCl salt form) to prevent
vision loss and diabetes-induced retinal disease in the streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetes model using female Long-
Evans rats; and 2) do the same in male Long-Evans rats. We will accomplish this by a) measuring visual function
through behavioral optokinetic analysis, using spatial frequency threshold and contrast sensitivity; b) measuring
inner and outer retinal thickness using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT); and c)
measuring AGE accumulation, macro-glial reactivity, and retinal ganglion cell survival. Successful completion of
this project will provide data supporting more thorough studies by a planned Phase II STTR submission while
helping prepare for IND-enabling studies following an early pre-IND FDA meeting.",  ,,,,RAJA G KHALIFAH,,(919) 454-1056,raja@praetego.com,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,  ,

Only 3% of BLV individuals have been employed in a STEM field.

Current methods for making STEM visualizations accessible through alt text are not scalable or amenable for use with dynamic digital media, nor is alt text standardized or proven usable by learners, resulting in lost learning opportunities for BLV students. The absence of reliable auto alt text generation is a roadblock for educational institutions and academic publishers to adopt new instructional technologies, as digital content and learning systems must include accommodations for accessibility. _x000D_

This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will create a first-of-its kind system that generates descriptions of STEM diagrams as the educational resources are constructed. This project will go beyond current standards for accommodation, by creating an innovative layered approach to the alt text representation of STEM diagrams so that screen reader users can interact with the content in a manner that is best supported by their skills and prior knowledge. The technical objectives are to: 1) create a system that produces machine-readable configurations for the components of a diagram and spatial relationships between the components, and then generates a text-based description of the diagram and 2) devise a non-linear method for representing STEM content through a standardized system of representational layers within the description. Both the general description (objective 1) and layered description (objective 2) will be constructed by matching the diagram configuration to a context-driven lexicon._x000D_

Long-term survival rates for children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) currently exceed
90%. However, prolonged ALL chemotherapy, which lasts two to three years on average, is associated with
significant fatigue and sleep disturbances in both children and their caregivers. In fact, patients and caregivers
often identify excess fatigue and sleep disturbances as the most distressing symptoms experienced during ALL
treatment. In addition to adversely impacting quality of life during treatment, fatigue and sleep problems may
alter mood, result in long-term cognitive dysfunction, and potentially compromise treatment efficacy. Despite
unfavorable fatigue and sleep being a pervasive problem in children with ALL and their caregivers, effective
intervention options are limited. Therefore, there is a significant unmet clinical need to identify evidence-based,
minimally invasive strategies to intervene and restore circadian rhythmicity in pediatric patients with ALL and
their caregivers. Building upon our previous success developing mobile applications to address cancer-related
fatigue in adult oncology populations, this proposal seeks to adapt a pilot mobile application to track sleep and
circadian rhythms in patients with ALL and their caregivers. While many existing resources provide information
on the importance of sleep duration, few highlight the role of circadian rhythms and light exposure. In particular,
while numerous commercial wearables exist that can track sleep, few if any give personalized
recommendations for how light exposure and other behaviors can be used to improve sleep, especially in
populations that are likely to have highly disrupted sleep. The proposed project will leverage consumer
wearable technology to conduct sleep and circadian analysis for children with ALL for the purposes of
prescribing lighting and behavioral recommendations to help improve sleep in these patients. Moreover, we
propose to extend the analysis and the prescriptions beyond the patients themselves, to their caregivers,
improving outcomes for the entire family. Specifically, this Phase I STTR proposes two aims: 1) we will design
a mobile app for reducing cancer-related fatigue in pediatric patients with ALL and their caregivers using a
patient-centered approach refined with feedback from patient-caregiver dyads, and 2) we will conduct a
usability study in a population of 16 patient-caregiver dyads to assess the feasibility of an app-delivered light
and behavior-based intervention in this population. The results of this Phase I application will provide the
foundation necessary to conduct a Phase II trial to assess the efficacy of the new app to reduce fatigue and
improve sleep quality and duration in a large population of pediatric ALL patients and their caregivers.
Ultimately, we anticipate this line of research will lead to the identification of a feasible, minimally invasive,
effective intervention to address fatigue and sleep issues in this vulnerable population, leading to
improvements in quality of life and outcomes.",  ,,,,OLIVIA  WALCH,,(703) 328-0848,olivia@arcascope.com,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,  ,

Spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, spina bifida, and stroke, as well as complications
due to aging and diabetes, can produce a loss of voluntary control over bowel and bladder function resulting
in both fecal and urinary incontinence as well as retention in the same patient. The activities proposed in this
application will enable Dignify Therapeutics to complete preclinical development of an on-demand, rapid-
onset (lt 5 min), short-duration (lt 10 min), drug-induced, voiding therapy to restore voluntary control of bowel
and bladder function for the patient populations listed above. This project will culminate in the filing of an
Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for DTI-117 and completion of a Phase I clinical study.
Neurokinin 2 receptors (NK2Rs) are located at several sites in the defecation and micturition pathways,
particularly the colorectal and urinary bladder smooth muscles. Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies in
several species, including human tissue, have shown that activation of NK2Rs produces forceful colonic and
bladder contractions. Our previous preclinical studies showed that when administered via intramuscular,
intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, or sublingual routes, NK2R agonists, including DTI-117, rapidly
induced transient increases in colorectal and bladder pressures that produced urination and defecation.
DTI-117 is currently in preclinical development by Dignify Therapeutics. Under NINDS CREATE Bio
Optimization Track award U44NS106685, efficacy, selectivity and preliminary safety of DTI-117 has been
established. A GMP-compliant synthetic route, physicochemical characterization, analytical methods,
bioanalytical assays, in vitro characterization, and target selectivity for NK2Rs versus multiple common
drug targets have all been established. Preclinical efficacy, measured as rapid-onset defecation and
urination, has been demonstrated, and in vivo pharmacokinetic profiles mimic in vivo pharmacodynamic
profiles. General toxicity studies completed to-date indicate that DTI-117 is both safe and effective.
The final step for preclinical development of DTI-117 is to file an Investigational New Drug application (IND)
prior to initiation of clinical studies. FDA guidelines require that acceptable toxicological and safety profiles
are demonstrated in preclinical studies conducted under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) conditions for
inclusion in the IND. In parallel, drug substance and drug product must be manufactured according to strict
FDA regulations. Completion of these activities as described in this application will enable an IND filing for
DTI-117.",  ,,,,EDWARD  BURGARD,,(919) 371-8138,eburgard@dignifytherapeutics.com,,  ,

At a very high level, our Phase II efforts will consist of technical improvements to our lifting tools for program synthesis, along with a new suite of tools for making the translation process more efficient, more robust, and less reliant on user input. Our Phase I efforts were organized around a synthesis engine coded in Rosette, which enables Rosette to view Go code as being punctured periodically with holes, where the holes refer to various patterns of unsafe behavior produced by a baseline ōnaiveö translation from C to Go. The Rosette synthesis engine then uses an SMT solver to fill those holes, replacing the pattern of unsafe behavior with a pattern of safe behavior. Additionally, in Phase I we built a Go utilities library that managed the parsing and translation of Go code into abstract syntax trees into S-expressions and back, to bridge between the raw C code and the finished Go code.

Abstract
The critical importance of solid-state NMR (ssNMR) was recently demonstrated by, after nearly two decades
of intense efforts, yielding the first atomic-resolution structures of the A40 and A42 amyloid fibrils that play a
crucial role in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Challenges posed by the inherently low sensitivity of NMR can be
improved by reducing the sample and circuit temperature to below 100 K, or preferably below 35 K – also
known as Ultra Low Temperature (ULT). Combining ULT NMR with another emerging technique, denoted as
dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), shows enormous promise for expanding the role of ssNMR by providing
significant S/N enhancements in many cases. However, despite the huge gain in S/N that is possible from
DNP, also performed at ~90 K, there are still only a handful of high-field MAS-DNP systems in the U.S. – pri-
marily because they are so expensive ($3-10M). Further, no commercially available instrumentation is availa-
ble for NMR experiments below 90 K, let alone ULT experiments combined with DNP. A huge step forward
would include the development of a high-mode THz cavity for more efficient microwave delivery to the sample,
thus enabling the use of a lower power and lower cost microwave source. An area of ssNMR that employs the
use of non-spinning (static) samples would benefit immensely from the availability of such a commercially built
ULT probe, with option for inclusion of DNP. Further, the static probe can serve as a prototype for a MAS ver-
sion of such a probe. The developments proposed under this project aim to reduce entry level cost into DNP
by more than an order of magnitude while reducing certain operational challenges.",  ,,,,FRANCIS D DOTY,,(803) 788-6497,david@dotynmr.com,,  ,

Understanding which lightning strikes are capable of igniting wildfires is critical as in the Western U.S. lightning-initiated wildfires are responsible for over 70% of the area burned in these environmental catastrophes. Globally, wildfires are responsible for 6.45 gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions annually (18% of total emissions). Detecting high risk lightning strikes (those capable of igniting wildfires) may also significantly reduce losses of life, wildlife, habitats, property, and forests as currently lightning-initiated wildfires in the US devastate 4-6 million acres per year. The reduction of wildfires can reduce large evacuations and smoke-related health conditions, thereby improving the health and welfare of the American public. Both people and businesses would benefit from lower insurance rates due to the decreased risk of wildfire damage. Large wildfires are a constant concern to more than half of the mission assurance priority military installations due to routine testing and training activities that are significant ignition sources. The proposed project may also address military ignition concerns. _x000D_
_x000D_
Wildfires start when a long continuing current (LCC) strikes the ground at a location where the environmental conditions are conducive for fire ignition. LCCs are those that last for 40 ms or longer and are essentially responsible for excessive heating. The transformative aspect of this research lies in the ground-based characterization of Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) lightning emissions to identify LCC strikes, with a 95% target detection efficiency and with 40 m accuracy. While for most lightning strikes the current ceases to flow after tens of microseconds, a small portion of lightning strikes (less than 10%) contain a continuing current that lasts thousands of times longer, from tens to hundreds of milliseconds. This can be viewed as a quasi-stationary arc between the cloud charge source and the ground and is detectable through electrostatic field changes and ELF emissions.A secondary innovative feature lies in the use of machine learning algorithms to pinpoint high risk lightning ignitions by analyzing the environmental conditions at the LCC strike location. This technology can identify a fire in seconds, unlike the present heat or smoke identification systems that can take hours or days to identify a fire._x000D_

In the tactical combat casualty care (TCCC) environment, ETI encompasses the majority of combat prehospital airway securement. Unfortunately, ETI is one of the most common incorrectly performed life-saving interventions in this setting, with failure rates as high as 18% by paramedics, and much higher rates of failed first-pass success. Error rates in the civilian sector are similar, where prehospital paramedic first-pass success ranges between 46% – 77%. One review noted that almost one in four patients receiving prehospital ETI were exposed to an error. Struggling with ETI leads to higher morbidity and increased downstream patient illness. Although operator skill, patient issues, and environmental factors all contribute to ETI challenges, there also exists a large technology gap that prevents patients from accessing safe and certain ETI in all circumstances and conditions. This is especially the case for less experienced operators whose incumbent responsibilities include this life-saving procedure. In the context of TCCC, this gap will be exacerbated within the long-distance en-route care or prolonged field care scenarios anticipated in the multi-domain operations environment. In these scenarios smaller, dispersed mobility forces will be more likely to perform definitive airway management (ETI) on casualties due to constraints imposed by prolonged evacuation and transit times. Highly experienced operators may not be immediately available, and limited resources will exacerbate strains associated with ETI-related complications. Operator visualization of the vocal cords has historically been the most difficult step for operators while performing ETI. However, despite the introduction of video-assisted laryngoscopy into practice almost 20 years ago, which arguably provides enhanced visualization, gaps remain in ETI success. This is because VL, while making visualization easier, has made the subsequent steps of insertion of the endotracheal tube (ETT) through the vocal cords and cannulation of the ETT into the trachea more difficult, resulting in a statistical inversion of the historical pain points. During our Phase I effort we demonstrated the technical feasibility of developing and manufacturing our bougie-integrated stylet technology. Our technology is founded upon a modern understanding of the anatomic and skill issues that inhibit rapid ETI success, particularly during video laryngoscopy. Our device uses a novel integrated bougie, which can be directed down the trachea via a memory wire, thus enabling easier vocal cords insertion and an unimpeded pathway for the ETT. Our aim is to finalize our technology which also aims to complement traditional direct laryngoscopy (DL) ETI, thus enhancing all current ETI enabling technologies.",Hugh  Connacher,,(301) 619-9804,hugh.i.connacher.civ@health.mil,Jeffery  Smith,,(210) 459-9361,jsmith@olifantmedical.com,,  ,

The new technological tools are expected to simplify the workflow, reduce costs and time, and enable the prediction of COVID-19 outbreaks and other pandemics several weeks before observing clinical cases. Such early prediction would provide the public and government agencies with important data and sufficient time to take preventive measures.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address a major technological barrier for the detection of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. Commercially available nucleic acid collection and purification kits are designed for clinical samples with small volumes.These kits are not generally used for large wastewater volumes where the virus is present at low concentrations. As a result, current processes are time-consuming, and result in the recovery of less than 30% of viruses and nucleic acids, significantly reducing the sensitivity. The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel virus and nucleic acid collection and purification technology from wastewater. Specifically, the project tasks aim at enhancing understanding of virus properties, particularly human coronaviruses in wastewater and their interactions with filter media. The project’s innovative approach is to design a streamlined workflow that includes all the steps from sample collection to detection, in a single disposable cartridge containing novel filters with high affinity to viruses. This development is expected to enhance viral and nucleic acid recovery in wastewater to over 90%, while reducing costs. The developed tools will be independently tested and evaluated by third-party laboratories to confirm their performance._x000D_

Ostomy surgery may also be necessary in cases of severe abdominal or pelvic trauma resulting from accidents or from injuries sustained during military service. A life-saving procedure, ostomy surgery allows bodily waste to pass through a surgically created opening called a stoma on the abdomen into a prosthetic known as a ‘pouch’ or ‘ostomy bag’ on the outside of the body. Patients are discharged from the hospital within days of ostomy creation and expected to heal at home using disposable ostomy pouches attached to the skin around their stoma. Unfortunately, current pouch designs offer little therapeutic benefit for post-surgery edema (swelling) and may not maintain a tight seal, allowing leakage of intestinal fluid and waste. Resulting stoma complications include mucocutaneous (skin/stoma) separation, stoma retraction, and moisture-associated skin damage. Up to 70% of ostomy patients endure these complications, with 29% of these patients requiring hospital readmissions at an additional cost of $78,000 per patient. Furthermore, risks for complications are higher for high body mass index (BMI) patients. Given the rise in clinical conditions requiring ostomy surgery, the increased BMI of the US population, and the current reimbursement landscape that penalizes the healthcare system for readmissions, an improved post- surgical incision management device to prevent ostomy complications is urgently needed. In this SBIR Direct Phase II, Fistula Solution will develop a novel post-surgical ostomy incision management device designed to prevent complications, form a tight seal, and protect the new stoma. This device stabilizes the tissue around the stoma to reduce edema and tension on sutures, along with holding the skin/stoma junction together to facilitate healing. In addition, the device creates a secure seal to stop stool leaks and prevent MASD. Our specific aims are to 1) optimize product design for manufacturability and clinical benefits; 2) verify product design and biocompatibility; and 3) conduct a clinical trial comparing the device to conventional adhesive ostomy pouches with HealthPartners Institute and Regions Hospital in St. Paul, Minnesota. The successful execution of our specific aims will establish device safety and efficacy and ensure the device is designed for manufacturability and biocompatibility. The human health benefit is a new standard of care to improve ostomy patient outcomes, shorten hospital stays, reduce readmissions to hospital, and mitigate a major financial exposure for hospitals.",  ,,,,ANDREW T OBST,,6512610733,andy@fistulasolution.com,,  ,

Although promising approaches are available for preventative interventions with youth at-risk for suicide, they demonstrate modest benefit, and recent reviews have concluded that new developments are required that facilitate not only greater effectiveness, but also enhance treatment engagement, adherence, and continuity of care amongst these young people. Digital tools, especially personal smartphones, are promising avenues to address these issues and can be used to provide a unique understanding of proximal risk factors, including psychological distress, anhedonia and behavioral withdrawal, and sleep disturbance amongst high- risk individuals. Furthermore, digital methods can provide ongoing supportive patient contact to support the reduction of suicide risk. The overall aim of this Fast-track SBIR proposal is to enhance the effectiveness of selective and indicated prevention for youth who are received outpatient mental health care by developing and testing a comprehensive digital platform that allows practitioners to integrate objective mobile sensing and HIPAA compliant client communication tools into their management of these young people. We have developed an initial MVP version of these products, and in Phase I will utilize user-centered design principles to enhance the product fit with typical service delivery systems found in healthcare organizations working with high-risk individuals (i.e., intensive outpatient services). The aim of Phase II is to further optimize these products and conduct a pragmatic clinical trial of the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of the products in a real world intensive outpatient clinical service. We will utilize the data generated by this trial to improve adoption, implementation fidelity, and sustained use of these tools, guided by an implementation science framework.",  ,,,,NICHOLAS B ALLEN,,5415159158,nick@ksanahealth.com,,  ,

As the world transitions from internal combustion engine vehicles to electric vehicles, the market for fuel cells is expected to increase substantially. Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) have a number of advantages, such as high durability, long range, and fast refueling over battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Additionally, fuel cells are less susceptible to the supply chain issues that lithium-ion batteries are beginning to suffer from. However, FCEVs are currently at a significant disadvantage to BEVs in terms of cost. Reducing the cost of the fuel cell stack will help to make FCEVs cost competitive with BEVs and will accelerate their adoption into the marketplace._x000D_
_x000D_
This SBIR Phase I project proposes to reduce the cost of PEM fuel cells by reducing the cost of the bipolar plate component. Bipolar plates currently account for approximately 30% of the full fuel cell stack cost. Current bipolar plates are made from either metal foils or molded carbon composites. Metal plates can be produced by high-speed, low-cost forming techniques, but must be made from expensive, corrosion resistant materials. Carbon bipolar plates are made from inexpensive precursors but are manufactured by processes which scale poorly. This project aims to demonstrate that a bipolar plate can be produced from a novel, low-cost, carbon-based sheet utilizing forming techniques analogous to those used for producing metallic bipolar plates. The effort focuses on optimizing the carbon sheet for low hydrogen permeability, demonstrating that flow channels can be stamped into the sheets, and quantifying functionality and durability by testing in small scale fuel cells._x000D_

The mission of Antiger Therapeutics Inc. is to develop novel immunotherapies for transplant recipients to
improve long-term graft outcomes and minimize adverse effects. Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is a
leading cause of graft loss, with over 3000 new cases per year in the United States and estimated market size
of $90 million. However, this estimate is likely to underestimate the market potential as currently no FDA-
approved drugs or treatments are available for AMR. Donor-specific antibodies (DSA) against class II human
leukocyte antigens (HLA) are the most frequent driver of AMR, which was reported in 68-91% of AMR after
kidney, heart, or lung transplants. Current therapies, such as plasma exchange and inhibition of all B cells or
plasma cells, have not demonstrated benefits for patients with AMR in randomized clinical trials. These
therapies also non-selectively suppress the immune system and increase the risk of severe infections. To
address these unmet needs, this SBIR will explore antigen-specific depletion of DSA-producing cells as a
novel approach to AMR treatment. In our preliminary work, we generated class I HLA fusion proteins that
potently and selectively depleted class I HLA-specific target cells in vitro and in vivo. This work motivated us to
develop targeted immunotherapies for AMR caused by class II DSA. The product of this SBIR will be a soluble
class II HLA biologic, capable of depleting a unique and more precise therapeutic target—B cells producing
antibodies against the specific class II HLA expressed on the graft. The technical innovation of this product is
the structure-based engineering of class II HLA to stabilize a high-risk antigen in AMR for production and
clinical translation. The product will be among the first-in-class biologics to enable antigen-specific
immunotherapy on the AMR market, with the potential of prolonging the graft survival and preserving the rest
of the humoral immunity for infection control. We hypothesize that functional class II HLA biologics can be
efficiently produced through two distinct engineering approaches, and these biologics should demonstrate
selective cytotoxicity against B cell hybridomas of the corresponding specificity. In Specific Aim 1, we will
generate a monovalent class II HLA biologic to deplete specific antibody-producing B cell hybridomas. In
Specific Aim 2, we will create a bivalent class II HLA biologic to deplete target cells. By the end of this phase I
SBIR, we expect to generate one or more candidate proteins with high production yield, purity, and selective
cytotoxicity against target cells to meet pre-specified acceptance criteria. We will further demonstrate the
efficacy and safety of these candidates in vivo in a phase II SBIR and then pursue licensing the product to a

Levodopa is the gold-standard symptomatic treatment for PD by elevating dopamine levels in the brain. Though the most effective treatment, prolonged levodopa use leads to 1) the debilitating side effect, levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), and 2) diminished levodopa efficacy which leads to fluctuations of PD symptoms, known as “wearing-off”. These concerns are two of the greatest unmet needs in PD and affect how doctors prescribe dosages and treatment options, impacting the efficacy of the necessary medications for PD. After 5 years of levodopa usage, 40% of PD patients will develop LID and/or fluctuations. Not only having a clinical impact, but PD patients with such complications require nearly $60,000 of additional therapeutics every year. Using Sinopia Biosciences’ computational platform, we studied gene expression changes due to levodopa administered to 6-OHDA lesioned PD-like mice. Applying our computational workflow, we identified a small molecule (SB-0107) that was selected based on: 1) having one of the top scores from our platform, 2) its novel mechanism of action, 3) previous clinical exposure to elderly patients, 4) its predicted CNS penetration properties, and 5) its potential for patent protection. Subsequently, we demonstrated the compound’s unique and potentially transformative pharmacology for treating both the symptoms of PD and complications of levodopa (i.e. LID). In both rodent and primate models, SB-0107 shows large effect sizes. Further, we observed in a cognitive deficit primate model of PD that SB-0107 improves performances in the tested cognitive tasks. Thus, SB-0107 represents a promising candidate for advancement to the clinic for PD. In this Fast-Track proposal, we will advance the compound by completing preclinical development studies for anticipation of IND submission.",  ,,,,AARASH  BORDBAR,,4082051008,abordbar@sinopiabio.com,,  ,
FIMBRION THERAPEUTICS INC,FimH-Targeting Antibody-Recruiting Molecules as Novel Drugs for Preventing Complicated Urinary Tract Infections,Department of Health and Human Services,National Institutes of Health,Phase I,SBIR,R43AI174482,1R43AI174482-01,3/1/23,2/28/25,PA21-259,2021.0,,4/5/22,NIAID,2023.0,600000.0,N9RQX3G4EH54,78513692,N,N,N,7.0,https://www.fimbrion.com/,20 S SARAH ST,,SAINT LOUIS,Missouri,63108-2819,"1 ABSTRACT. Urinary tract infections (UTI) are extremely common world-wide, and can lead to serious  2 complications, including renal scarring and urosepsis. Standard-of-care treatments rely on antibiotics: empiric  3 treatment for uncomplicated UTI (uUTI), broad-spectrum for complicated UTI (cUTI), and long-term prophylaxis  4 for recurrent UTI (rUTI). This constant antibiotic exposure not only disrupts the gut microbiome but drives  5 antimicrobial resistance among uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp), the  6 predominant causative agents of UTI. The global spread of multidrug-resistant uropathogens, such as those  7 caused by extended spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae  8 (CRE), has been designated by the CDC as “serious” and “urgent” public health threats, respectively. Therefore,  9 new strategies to combat multidrug resistance are desperately needed. One such approach is to target and 10 inhibit the function a key virulence factor of UPEC and Kp, the FimH adhesin. FimH is a surface-exposed, 11 mannose-binding protein that facilitates bacterial binding to the host urinary bladder epithelium, and its function 12 is essential for the establishment and persistence of a UTI. Using this anti-adhesive strategy, a small molecule 13 mannoside FimH antagonist was developed by Fimbrion and GlaxoSmithKline and is currently in Phase 1b 14 clinical trials for the treatment of uUTI. As a follow-up to this collaboration, we began exploring the next 15 generation of FimH antagonists that target the more difficult-to-treat cUTI, by additionally recruiting antibodies 16 from the host immune system. Known as FimH antagonist antibody recruiting molecules (FimH-ARMs), these 17 mannoside-based therapeutics have nanomolar affinity for the FimH target and our early protype FimH-ARM has 18 shown enhanced ability to reduce the severity of acute bladder infection in a mouse model of uUTI. We 19 hypothesize that in addition to antagonism of FimH function, FimH-ARMs will provide additional mechanisms of 20 action (MoAs) through engagement of the immune system and extended pharmacokinetics (PK), resulting in 21 superior efficacy over conventional mannosides in cUTI. The main goals of this proposal are: (1) to generate a 22 highly potent lead series of FimH-ARMs that will recruit naturally occurring human antibodies to uropathogenic 23 bacteria and (2) demonstrate in vivo efficacy in a model of cUTI. To accomplish these goals, we will (i) expand 24 the FimH-ARM library to identify potent lead compounds with optimized mouse PK profiles, and (ii) test the in 25 vivo efficacy of lead FimH-ARMs in a mouse cUTI model and (iii) Select our advanced lead FimH-ARM and 26 establish the spectrum of activity, MoA, and PK benchmarks for late lead optimization in Phase II. Success will 27 be defined as: identification of an advanced lead FimH-ARM, that shows in vivo efficacy superior to its parent 28 small molecule FimH antagonist and non-inferiority to a standard-of-care antibiotic and demonstrates additional 29 immune system MoAs beyond FimH antagonism. These studies will facilitate the early preclinical development 30 of a novel, antibiotic-sparing therapeutic, for preventing cUTI caused by FimH-expressing uropathogens.",  ,,,,LAUREL  MCGRANE,,3146025105,mydockl@fimbrion.com,,  ,

Analysis of complex cellular processes in understanding disease, development of drugs, or testing
efficacy of therapies often requires dynamic measurements of both cellular markers and cellular
products. The ability to synchronously and rapidly conduct such measurements in complex cell-
containing samples using a single instrumental analysis will be useful and beneficial across
biotechnology. The goal of this project is to enable such multiplex analysis of T-cell activation using
immunophenotyping and quantitative monitoring of their secreted cytokines as an important model
system. High throughput measurement of samples of suspended cells is made possible using
BennuBio’s Velocyt® multi-stream acoustic flow cytometry system. The primary innovation of this
project is the implementation of negative acoustic contrast particles (NACPs) as a bead-based
immunoassay platform that significantly extends the analytical capabilities of the Velocyt® instrument
for simultaneous analysis of cell-associated and soluble biomarkers. In contrast to cells, which
migrate to, and are analyzed at, discreet positions within the Velocyt® flow stream,NACPs are
separated to distinct positions in the flow stream, allowing for easy discrimination between bead and
cells in a single sample. In this proof-of-concept Phase I research, we aim to conduct simultaneous
measurement of the T-cell activation marker CD25 in both the CD4 and CD8 population at the same
time that we measure secreted interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α . While this demonstration will
be of significance to the development of pharmaceuticals for treatment of a range of immunological
and infectious diseases that involve T-cell activation, it will also provide a firm basis by which to
design and commercialize customizable NACP-based reagent kits to address a wide range of
disciplines across biotechnology.",  ,,,,JOHN P OROURKE,,(505) 272-6264,jorourkejr@salud.unm.edu,,  ,

The highly/complaint membrane affords a low/mass eartip and yields: 1) a large contact patch against the dog’s ear canal, giving high passive attenuation; 2) elasticity for retention during head motion, ear canal (jaw) movement, and g/force; 3) comfort -on insertion and extended wearing. Empirical human studies by the team have demonstrated this, with a ‘pneumatic’ closed/circuit system and ‘semi/pneumatic’ variant, which offer 2 options. Using anthropometric data of target breeds, feasibility for ‘one/size/fits/most’ is good: at less than 4mm in unexpanded state, the eartip will insert into and expand slightly to seal a 5th percentile canal and has dynamic expansion range for a 95th percentile canal (11/13mm diameter). Two thin ‘stent’ ducts through the K9HPD hold the ear canal loudspeaker for ambient sound/command pass/through and for radio communications, and an ear canal microphone enables seal tests and ANC feedback. Electronics are in a low/profile housing on the outside of K9HPD, not extending into the scapha of the pinna. These produce the required 2000/4000 Hz passband as default; but an option enables handler/adjustable, band/specific filtering/gain via tablet/cellphone software, for rapid mission/specific tuning. ANC adds 8/12 dB attenuation below 1000 Hz and is handler/switchable on the housing, for low/frequency exposures in helicopters or tracked vehicles; ANC will also offer AUTO/ON when the dB level exceeds a preset hazard value. Canine Acoustical Test Fixtures will be fabricated to efficiently test attenuation and hear/through fidelity, per ANSI S12.42, prior to refined prototype testing on dogs at 2 universities. The research team includes 3 SPEAR/HEAR experts in passive/ANC HPD design with lead (PI) experience over 30 DoD projects, Professor/Director of Virginia Tech’s (VT) Auditory Systems Lab with 40 years in military/civilian HPDs, Professor in canine hearing at Univ. of Cincinnati FetchLab, veterinarian (D.V.M.) at VT and otolaryngologist (M.D.), earphone/ANC Distinguished Engineer from Bose (recently retired), patent attorney with HPD experience, electronics/fabrication personnel, and 2 commercialization experts.

Fire-safe and low-cost redox flow batteries, combined with rooftop solar panels or backyard wind turbines, can meet the increased electricity needs of American families without relying on the national grid. During the daytime, solar arrays convert solar energy to chemical energy in batteries. During evenings, batteries will power houses and charge electric vehicles in family garages. Batteries play a critical role in harvesting and storing clean electricity for residential uses. Compared with lithium-ion batteries, the improved fire-safety profiles and reduced production costs of flow batteries will give homeowners peace of mind and allow the wider adoption of clean energy by society._x000D_
_x000D_
This SBIR phase I project proposes to develop novel proton-conductive polymeric membranes that show reduced metal electrolyte crossovers and build the first 7 kW flow battery system that meets the energy need of a single-family house. To this end, the project will synthesize a group of phosphorylated polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) that have a phosphoric acid side chain. Such phosphoric acid groups can form unique zirconium phosphonate clusters that transport protons but deny the unwanted migration of metal cations. PBIs provide mechanical support to the zirconium-phosphate clusters. Zirconium and PBIs are bulk materials that cost significantly less than commercial perfluorosulfonic acids. The second task of this phase I project is to construct a 7 kW iron-titanium redox flow battery system. The peak electricity demand for the average American single-family house is around 7 kW. Such a battery will be connected to a rooftop solar system to meet residential electricity demands. The team plans to study various cell configuration designs. In particular, the project will focus on examining the effects of solvent channels of bipolar plates on the performance of the stack. In addition, other design parameters, such as pump flow rates and the choice of sealant materials, will be thoroughly investigated._x000D_

In Phase I, we demonstrated for the first time that MPA-based solvers for multiple problems can be connected in a comprehensive architecture to solve a hierarchical planning problem that arises in air tasking order production. In the proposed Phase II effort, we plan to fully develop and release an open-source software suite for MPA-based optimization that is tuned to tackle hierarchical planning and scheduling problems that are too complex to be handled by traditional, monolithic solvers such as Google’s OR-Tools. We call our toolkit BP-OPT to emphasize its use of belief propagation. In Phase II, we will also integrate BP-OPT with Caliola’s AssuredConf product to solve an important emerging satellite communications beam assignment and antenna configuration problem. AssuredConf is an automated planning tool that we are developing to support Operation Plan development at the Combatant Commands. A major theme of our proposed work is the cross-pollination of MPA-based techniques from digital receiver design to combinatorial optimization. The Phase II effort will be led by Caliola’s Chief Scientist, Dr. Tom Halford. His doctoral work at USC established fundamental performance versus complexity tradeoffs for MPAs. At Caliola, he leads an interdisciplinary team that is developing planners for the next generation of Navy modems and Air Force weapons data links. The USC team will be led by Prof. Keith Chugg.

The elastomers used in protective equipment often have fluoropolymer components or fluoropolymer-based coatings applied to enhance their barrier properties. Fluoropolymers and the fluorinated compounds used in their production are in a class of chemicals called per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and have been used in industry and commercial products for many years, and they are emitted into the environment and people are exposed to them at all stages of a fluoropolymer’s life cycle. The discovery of the widespread presence of PFAS in the environment, wildlife, and human blood triggered large-scale investigations into their persistence and health effects. The results have prompted increased scrutiny of the usage and disposal of PFAS-containing materials by governmental agencies, including the Department of Defense (DoD), which may impact the procurement and use of clothing treated with PFAS-containing materials. The Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBD) is seeking to address this issue through the development of a novel, non-PFAS elastomeric barrier material for CBRN protective items that provides protection against liquid and vapor chemical threats while maintaining flexibility and durability. The new elastomeric barrier material should possess the properties for protective materials described in the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1994 Class 1 standard, including chemical permeability, puncture, tear, and flame resistance.

However with theongoing climate changes the industry is facing an increasing threat from a root rot disease knownas Rhizoctonia Crown and Root Rot (RCRR) caused by a fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solanitogether with a bacterial pathogen Leuconostoc mesenteroides. The pathogens infect the crop inthe field and then degrade it and its sugar during storage. Additionally L. mesenteroides producesdextran during sucrose fermentation which plugs the factory filters leading to a severe drop inprocessing efficiency. Growers lose several millions of dollars of profits annually as a result. Thisproject aims to develop a biofungcide from an estuarine bacterium that can prevent RCRR.Preliminary data indicated that one bioactive component in the envisioned product could inhibitboth R. solani and L. mesenteroid and prevent RCRR in artificially infected roots. Hence phase Iwill characterize the bacterium's bioactive potential in greater detail and test the feasibility of theenvisioned product formulation in preventing RCRR in field conditions which will lead to thecommercialization of the innovation. Also it will pave the way for new applications of theinnovation to prevent root rot issues in other crops. This will expand Mycologics' product portfolioand strengthen the company's business model of entering into a product licensing agreement with aglobal Agricultural Technology company for faster market penetration.,  ,,,,Anindya  Chanda,,(517) 899-9410,chanda@mycologics.net,,  ,

Countless program crashes, hangs, and security vulnerabilities have been attributed to uninformed or malicious use of this freedom. CÆs extension C++ provides better programming abstractions but insists on backward compatibility with C and thus suffers from similar risks, which are unacceptable in domains like systems programming or for defense applications. In contrast, languages considered to be (memory-)safe restrict direct memory access by programmers and include C#, Java, and Go. The Rust programming language offers safe programming features without resorting to expensive runtime management techniques like garbage collection and can therefore promise to deliver well-performing system-level and network applications. In order to extend the advantages of modern languages to legacy code, this proposal presents a strategy for migrating actively used C++ code to Rust that maximally benefits from the idiomatic and safety features of Rust, such as aggressively employing move semantics for assignments, and generics for reusable code patterns. We are seeking to produce human-maintainable programs in Rust, suitable for code under active development. Our strategy is to perform the migration in two stages. We begin with a refactoring step that attempts to harden the given C++ code, guided by Rust safe-programming rules. This step prepares the code for an easier migration to Rust, but also results in safer C++ code as a useful intermediate product. The refactoring is followed by a target code generation step, which attempts to recognize code segments with a particular intent, represents these in a language-agnostic concept representation, and retargets these concepts into Rust, using a library of Rust code templates. Acknowledging the hardness of the problem and the boldness of our proposed solution, our approach is semi-automatic, requesting user assistance to resolve ambiguities in inferring the intent of the code. The user interaction is supported by the integration of CRAM into an Integrated Development Environment, which displays the source code, the outcome of any refactorings, and the result of migrating code segments. For each operation performed on the source code, the user has the option of accepting or rejecting it, and of modifying its result. Despite human involvement, a problem of this magnitude demands an arsenal of assurance artifacts, such as tests and proofs, that aim to give evidence of the correctness of the migration, and the reliability of the target program. Our approach will deliver both migrated and automatically generated test cases, as well as proofs that establish the preservation of the program semantics by our refactoring and code generation steps.",Sergey N Bratus,Program Manager,5712184428,sergey.bratus@darpa.mil,Thomas  Wahl,,6072737340,twahl@grammatech.com,,  ,

Drought is an extremely serious and recurring problem that limits cropproductivity and affects the economic vitality of farmers. The major corporate seed corn companieshave created a multi-billion-dollar industry based on genetically modified crops. However droughttolerance has been difficult to effectively engineer into plants because of the complexity of plantresponses to water stress. XERICO technology overcomes this barrier. Its commercial deploymentwill significantly improve the profitability of growers and seed companies and will benefit societyby enabling crop production on arid lands. XERICO Technology is transformative compared to thecurrent state of the art. It utilizes a plant's natural response to better protect it from drought stress.This drought tolerance mechanism is employed in a highly drought-specific manner to avoid thegrowth penalty often observed in drought tolerance technologies. Furthermore XERICO-mediateddrought tolerance is achieved with limited perturbation of other biological processes in the plantswhich insures that drought tolerance can be achieved without disturbing normal growth. Howeverthere are important technical risks that must be mitigated prior to commercial deployment of thetechnology. Its efficacy needs to be proven through field tests using XERICO transgenic seeds withclean genetic backgrounds. Using XERICO transgenic corn plants in uniform B73 backgroundsthis project will demonstrate that the technology effectively protects crops from drought damages infield conditions thereby reducing the technical risk and make it much more attractive tocommercialization partners.,  ,,,,Kyung-Hwan  Han,,(517) 803-9418,hanky@msu.edu,Michigan State University,  ,

The compounds have been used in a range ofconsumer products owing to these robust properties. Their unusual stability and thus long half-life have ledto the proliferation of these compounds in the environment. It is now well established that ingestion of thesechemicals can lead to the development of a range of health disorders from endocrine disruption to cancer.Regulations at the federal and state level are setting health advisories of maximum acceptable concentrationlevels. Unfortunately conventional water treatment systems cannot remove PFAS. The recalcitrant natureof these compounds owing to the strength and shielding effects of the carbon-fluorine bonds makesdestructive removal difficult (typical bond energies ~100 kcal/mol). Membrane and activated carbon arecapable of removing PFAS effectively but each creates a concentrated waste stream. The US EPA identifiesa research gap for low-cost methods to process concentrate streams from membrane processes or cheapermethods to regenerate activated carbon. The effort proposed here aims to use plasma to destroy PFAScompounds both in contaminated water systems and in concentrate streams derived frommembrane processes. While it is widely recognized that plasmas are effective at destroying PFASthe consensus is that work needs to be done on scaling up the process and quantifying overallimplementation and operational costs. To date plasma reactorsâ€”even the large onesâ€”have beenpredominantly batch-mode reactors. It is desirable in industrial or municipal applications to treatwater in a flow reactor configuration. Our goal is to investigate the feasibility of a once-throughscalable flow plasma reactor capable of treating practical influent flows.PFAS removal via plasma treatment is predominantly a surface treatment process--essentially longchain hydrophobic PFAS compounds are degraded by energetic electrons ions and UV light exposure.Considerable destruction is initiated via reduction by solvated electrons derived from the plasma whereelectron addition leads to spontaneous bond cleavage and defluorination. To destroy the PFAS with plasmamultiple exposures of the liquid surface are required to reduce the contaminants to smaller chains andultimately to cause mineralization. In this regard one must circulate the volume of water to be treated pastthe plasma multiple times as in a batch reactor. This proposal aims to convert from batch-mode explored inprevious experiments to a flow reactor geometry while preserving batch mode kinetics. We hypothesizethat using a series of reactors with recirculation such that water exposure to plasma matches thecontact time in our batch reactor we can achieve similar degradation in a flow-through geometry.Removal is achieved through serial processing of the water as it passes from one microreactor to the nextso that the water receives the requisite number of passes through the plasma over the characteristic timeconstant as realized in a batch reactor. Furthermore we will use reverse osmosis concentrate as our inputfeedwater. This PFAS load is degraded to desired levels at the end of the final microreactor where thatwater is blended with RO permeate to achieve the desired MCL thus realizing a true flow-through reactor.The scalability of this system will be explored through the addition of parallel legs of microreactors. In allcases the kinetics through a given flow reactor will match the exposure realized in the batch reactor fromprevious work. The work proposed will investigate a scalable 10 gallons/min flow system with capacity forup to 50 gallons/min. Understanding the scalability of plasma-based water treatment systems can providea significant commercial and societal benefit.

This Phase II project will demonstrate the capability and value of fielding a littoral system for monitoring onshore activity. When this project concludes, Quantum will provide DARPA recommendations for a system engineered for operations in specified locales. The proposal addresses the problem of surveilling significant activities of interest on land and in the land-water transition zone. The concept is to place arrays of ocean bottom recorders on the littoral seabed off the shoreline of Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS) for collecting signals from sources active on and in the surrounding land, seabed, water, and near-surface airspace environments. Each ocean bottom recorder comprises three geophones oriented orthogonally, one omnidirectional hydrophone, heading sensor, data acquisition and storage system, and a 70-day integrated power supply. Data will be collected using the seabed arrays for at least 30 days and include structured testing events using controlled energy sources on land and at sea. In addition, proximity to CCFSF provides numerous sources of opportunity such as: helicopter flights over land and sea; static liquid fueled rocket engine tests; rocket launches; sea vessel security operations; large boat operations (supporting space launch events); and large cruise vessels entering and leaving Port Canaveral. Quantum is very confident signals from such highly energetic sources will appear in the data recorded by the seabed arrays. The three project technical objectives are: (1) Collect signals with a network of passive seismic-acoustic phased arrays placed on the seabed in littoral waters originating with both controlled and uncontrolled seismic-acoustic energy sources of interest; (2) Using existing algorithms and methods perform a detailed analysis of the collected data, assess the ability of the individual seismic-acoustic phased arrays for acquiring signals from energy sources of interest, and assess the performance of the network of arrays for locating and spatially tracking these energy sources; and (3) Optimize the signal and information processing functions for improved overall performance against the DARPA-specified sources of interest within the volume of collected data. Quantum and its parent company Geospace Technologies will manufacture and deploy the seabed arrays. In coordination with DARPA, Quantum will write and execute a Data Collection Plan and a Phased Data Analysis Plan. At project completion, Quantum will provide a comprehensive summary final report on the deployment, data collection, and analysis results with recommended next steps for maturing the demonstrated capability into an operational surveillance system.",Katherine N Woolfe,Program Manager,(703) 526-2062,katherine.woolfe@darpa.mil,Paul  Nyffenegger,,(321) 868-0288,pnyffenegger@qtsi.com,,  ,

This amphibious vessel an ideal design for meeting the speed, payload, and sea state requirements for Expeditionary Advanced Basing Operations (EABO) and Littoral Operations in a Contested Environment (LOCE). The ROM SHARC design will support Mine Countermeasure Forces, Lethal Long-Range Unmanned Systems, as well as Forward Force Maneuver and Posture Resilience. The catamaran will additionally have ballistic and electro-magnetic interference (EMI) protection available for critical components, such as engine and control system. Full Naval integration is a key design element. ROM’s SHARC design will have multi-mission capability for carrying Expeditionary Modular Autonomous Vehicle (EMAV), Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), and Unmanned Underwater Systems (UUS) as well as other equipment, smaller land vehicles, shelters, fuel bladders, electrical generation equipment, personnel, and evacuation/medical platforms. For Phase II, ROM Development Corporation proposes to build a full-scale and operational 40’ Catamaran with twin 300 hp outboard diesel engines and basic level of autonomy in Phase II Base with a higher level of autonomy with a Phase II Option.  The craft will be capable of carrying the 14,000 lb. EMAV and other payload at 25 knots in sea state 2 and 20 knots in Sea State 3 at 80% MCR and have enough fuel to support the 200 NM range requirement.   The SHARC has been designed to allow both a bow and stern ramp enabling both bow and stern loading/off-loading as well as the potential to create a bridge to the beach/dock.  For transportability, the ROM SHARC complies with all road transportation requirements of the continental United States.  The craft will meet or exceed the requirements stated by the US Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) Statement of work and technical specifications. The stability and payload capability of ROM’s SHARC catamaran design is proven and cost effective to build large unit volumes. Using ROM’s knowledge of both specialty craft and production boat-building brings unique volume, low-cost and capability knowledge to the US Marines. With long-term, low-cost, and high-volume production in mind the design and engineering will be driven by manufacturing cost effectiveness. We will design to plug-and-play autonomous sensors and computers, as the technology is rapidly evolving and will need continuous upgrades.

RC urban farmers have limited crop choices and a short 6-7-month crop growing period.To meet consumer demand most produce is imported year round from warmer states leading tohigher produce prices and often inferior produce quality. Therefore there is an urgent need toinnovate GH structures for superior performance and durability for northern locations withextreme and unpredictable weather.We propose to investigate the applicability of a compound parabolic concentrator and oilheat transfer fluid system to convert solar energy to thermal energy. A heat exchanger systemlocated inside the highly insulated greenhouse will transfer the thermal energy to water which willbe circulated through the water lines placed in a rock bed. The circulating warm water willo o
sufficiently raise the soil temperature (nighttime temperature>50 F; daytime temperature >75 F)to permit cultivation of warm weather crops all year around. Additionally the proposed designmodeled after the Chinese Solar Greenhouses will enhance the structural integrity to providesuperior high wind and hail-resilience. Techno-economic analysis using a discounted cash flowrate of return (DCFROR) model will estimate financial performance and economic feasibility.Considering the unpredictable weather of RC the researchers believe that a laboratory-
scale prototype is required to gather real-time data to accurately evaluate the performanceefficiency of the GH. Synthetic data might not adequately capture the unexpected outcomes of afrequent hailstorm or adverse weather conditions typical to RC.Lack of affordable energy efficient greenhouses for unpredictable and extreme weathercoupled with the strong desire amongst the RC farmers to grow vegetables all year round are thepotential key market drivers for this product. Farmers of RC are highly interested in takingadvantage of the high demand for fresh vegetables and fruits to supplement their income.Therefore Shende LLC is confident of a strong market for their Energy-Efficient Extreme WinterSolar Greenhouse product in South Dakota and neighboring states.",  ,,,,Anuradha  Shende,,(605) 393-7012,anuradha.r.shende@gmail.com,,  ,

Ultra-wide band gap (UWBG) devices based on GaN, SiC, Diamond, Ga2O3 have attractive electronic and thermal properties that have positioned them to their full potential with offer savings in both energy and cost in high-power, high-temperature electronic device applications. Among these UWBG materials, SiC and CVD diamond are attractive for wafer application due to their high thermal conductivities and importantly availability in large size wafers. Whereas GaN and Ga2O3 have superior electronic properties in terms of device performances in their device categories.  There is a huge potential synergy in achieving highest performance in UWBG devices by realizing hydride structures by interface fusion technology which is the foundation of this proposal. This proposal addresses a novel approach and further advancement in interface infusion via surface activation, catalyzation, and chemical ordering to create ultra-sharp interfaces between dissimilar materials with lowest possible thermal resistance between devices to bonded substrates. Our methodological approach will advance device fabrication and bonding engineering to yield a commercially viable manufacturing system turkey product for advanced electronic devices. We propose Phase I option, and its goal is to optimize surface bonding processing conditions versus interface thermal resistance that will lead to design and improve the manufacturability, quality, and efficiency of thermal transport across heterogeneous interfaces via in-situ ultra-thin and ultra-pure surface catalyzation using our accelerated atomic fusion technology for bonding high thermal conductivity large area wafers with UWBG and ultra-high-power devices.

Currently, around a dozen nations have programs to develop and deploy MSRs. Challenges to the deployment of MSRs are due primarily to the corrosive and dynamic molten salt. For safe operation of the reactor it is paramount to accurately monitorandcontrolthemoltensalt properties. Measuring viscosity and density data improve safety and lead to efficiency optimization for flow through fuel and coolant heat exchangers. The viscosity and density measurements must be high-throughput and require only a small amount of fluid. The measurements also need to be precise, and the instrument must withstand the extreme, corrosive temperature and radiation environment of the molten salt. Viscosity and density measurement using cantilever oscillators to serve these challenging needs are of interest. This project proposes a viscosity and density measurement probe made out of diamond for use in molten salt reactors. The technology is based on measurements of the resonant vibrational modes of a cantilever oscillator submerged in the molten salt. The position of the resonant modes allows for determination of the viscosity and density. The oscillator is made from diamond so that it can withstand the harsh conditions of the molten salt. Also, the diamond allows for the optical detection and readout of the oscillator vibrations using a reflecting laser interferometry. GLCT will synthesize the diamond and process it into the cantilever oscillators. Photolithography and structure masking will be done at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) using the General User Program. Dry etching will be done at GLCT. Amplitude-frequency testing of the prototypes devices will be done at ANL. Success in the proposed effort will allow for the better monitoring of nuclear molten salt reactors, which will increase their safety, efficiency and commercial viability. Nuclear molten salt reactors overcome the primary hazard of traditional nuclear reactors; there is no meltdown risk with molten salt reactors. They are safer than traditional technology because they use molten salt as coolant rather than water, and because they operate at relatively low pressure near atmospheric. The waste from molten salt reactors is significantly less radioactive than traditional nuclear reactor technology. New, 100 megawatt thorium-MSRs are estimated to produce energy for $2,000 per watt compared to $2,300 per watt for coal and $4000 per watt for traditional nuclear.",  ,,,,Paul  Quayle,,(919) 593-8595,quayle@glcrystal.com,,  ,

Although the structural components are made out of corrosion resistant steels such as SS 316 or 800H alloys, (per ASME Section III Division 5 guidance), they do not provide enough protection. Hence, there is a need for developing surface protection interface that will inhibit corrosion. The Department of Energy (DOE) seeks novel solutions for advanced nuclear reactors, including high temperature Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) and molten metal reactors (MMRs). The innovative MSR designs include chloride- and fluoride-based molten salt reactors. Consequently, the materials used in the structural components of the reactor primary loop where the molten salt circulates must not only be corrosion-resistant but must also be compatible with the reactor components. Presently, weld overlay cladding, roll bonding etc. are used but do not provide extended life span. In this phase I STTR, we propose that the usage of bimetallic RHEAs, in the form of thick surface layers with proper pre- and post-processing, can provide long-term corrosion resistance for liquid-cooled, high-temperature reactor components. In this Phase I STTR, we propose to develop novel, thick-surface layer processes and components based on proven, bimetallic corrosion-resistant refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) coatings with enhanced corrosion and wear protection. The proposed thermal spray process has the capability to provide highly bonded thick coatings that are resistant to peeling, spalling, scratching, and debonding etc. We are focusing on the development of corrosion resistant RHEA thick coatings to protect the high temperature reactor components by using plasma spray and HVOF techniques. The selected RHEAs, formed from well-known, reactor-compatible elements, such as hafnium, zirconium, niobium, chromium, rhenium, vanadium, and molybdenum, will be synthesized in bulk and powder form suitable as feedstock for a thermal spray coating (Air Plasma Spray and High Velocity Oxygen Fuel), as well as solid components using spark plasma sintering. The coated substrates will subsequently be characterized and validated experimentally for their corrosion resistance, structural strength and mechanical properties. Thick bimetallic RHEA coatings will provide significant near- and long-term corrosion &amp; oxidation solutions along with high temperature capability for reactors; and fortunately, these solutions also serve other advanced reactors designs, high-efficiency power conversion units (e.g., liquid cooled reactors, CO2 Recompression Closed Brayton Cycles), high-temperature combustion cycles (e.g., Allam Cycles), concentrated solar power, and aerospace applications. The benefits of this endeavor will result in reactors that operate at increasingly higher temperatures, for improved power-generating performance, reduced maintenance cost, and lower CO2 footprint. In addition, by leveraging recent SNL patents and recent advances at DRS and SNL, we will demonstrate low-cost, near-term solutions for high-temperature applications. In particular, we will validate the application of various bimetallic RHEA compositions for industrial-grade nuclear reactor applications within two years. These advantages will inevitably result in more favorable economics for the RHEA-based SMRs and provide tremendous marketing opportunities at the domestic and international level.",  ,,,,salvador  rodriguez,,(505) 720-8668,sbrodri@sandia.gov,"Sandia National Laboratories, California (SNL-CA)",Sal  Rodriguez,

For this reason, local air quality patterns and trends are often inaccessible to disadvantaged communities (DACs). Many technologies that will be used for deep decarbonization of industrial and power facilities have the added co-benefit of reducing non-CO2 pollutants, such as criteria air pollutants, but there is a lack of information regarding the economic, social, health, and climate benefits from these emissions reductions. The impacts of pollutants from point-source emitters often affect communities of lower socioeconomic status or composed of ethnic and racial minorities. Understanding the full suite of benefits offered by advanced decarbonization, such as carbon capture and storage and hydrogen-fuel switching, will be important for advocate for equitable climate and energy solutions. We will develop the Local Climate and Air Quality Emissions Tracking Atlas (LOCAETA), an interface that enables local stakeholders, commercial users, urban researchers, and decision-makers to evaluate the impact of point-source emitters on local communities. We will apply machine learning to rapidly identify and characterize areas affected by point-sources and deploy atmospheric models to determine likely sources of pollutant transport at a neighborhood level. We will identify data sources necessary to quantify the impacts from point-source emitters in the state of Louisiana, which will serve as the initial proofing region before a larger geographic expansion that will eventually target nationwide data coverage. This analysis will be done using a range of public models and international, national, and regional datasets. LOCAETA will use 1) cutting-edge machine learning techniques to identify relationships between pollutant concentrations, point-source emitters, public health trends, and environmental justice; 2) investigate local transport of primary pollutants using atmospheric dispersion models to evaluate impacts to environmental systems and human health; 3) create a free online interface that is optimized for ease-of-use to share these data products; and 4) develop a database of detailed impacts from point-source emitters to facilitate more accurate modeling of changes to earth and environmental systems regarding critical infrastructure, natural resource, and energy resilience. There are currently no publicly available, up-to-date inventory of pollutant impacts from point source emitters in North America. Existing products are limited by scope and or scale. We will develop an inventory with LOCAETA, which could have tremendous applications because of the importance of air pollutants on human health and the quantity of point-source emitters that will need to be decarbonized. Decisions informed by LOCAETA data could save thousands of lives per year and help the United States achieve its decarbonization goals.

Each one of these commercial scale operations will sequester greater than one metric megaton per year of CO2 in geologic reservoirs, with an initial focus on storage in brine filled aquifers. To ensure safe storage with the injected CO2 behaving as predicted, and that there is not a risk of induced seismicity that develops due to over- pressuring of the reservoir and surrounding strata, the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program recently has funded efforts to develop ‘turn-key passive seismic monitoring and networks services’ that are rugged and robust enough to be installed and last for up to and over 30 years. The ‘turn-key’ nature of these systems refers to the system containing an intelligent level of automatic data processing and streamlined interpretation such that there is not a post-data acquisition burden placed on operators and decision makers. In this proposal we will demonstrate the feasibility of fiber optic electrical and electromagnetic sensors which may be deployed to secure carbon storage sites. By using these sensors to map the electrical resistivity of the reservoir, the CO2 can be mapped. This is because the resistivity is significantly affected when brine is replaced by CO2 or brine displaces fresher water. Paulsson Inc. (PI) proposes a system where fiber-optic based downhole sensors are used to monitor downhole Electric and Electromagnetic fields on a continuous basis. These sensors will provide data currently unavailable to the industry for monitoring the integrity of carbon storage sites. In the SBIR Phase I, we apply optical fiber to detect strain of custom designed cores of piezoelectric material such as PZT (Lead Zirconate Titanate). The fluctuating electric fields cause dimensional changes in the PZT which are detected using the high sensitivity strain measuring capability of optical fiber. For electric field sensors, sensitivity is amplified by wrapping multiple turns of fiber around custom designed cores or by interrogating multiple fiber wrapped cores in ‘parallel’. The sensors developed in this project will allow for higher resolution subsurface mapping, which will benefit the CO2 Sequestration, Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), Underground Gas Storage (UGS), and Unconventional Oil &amp; Gas Markets. Initially the CO2 sequestration market will be small, but these sensors can also be deployed in the UGS market to help alleviate regulator concerns of another blowout such as the one that occurred in Aliso Canyon, California.

Production of high purity (&gt;95%) oxygen at modular scale is an enabling technology for successful development and deployment of these systems. Cryogenic air separation units are the standard commercial technology for large scale, high purity oxygen production with unit O2 cost between $33-$70 per ton/day. However, there is no cost-effective offering for cryogenic system at such small range (10 – 50 ton/day oxygen), therefore, it is not an economically viable option for modular gasification application. The commercial non-cryogenic separation in this range is mostly based on conventional pressure-swing adsorption (PSA) and/or vacuum-pressure-swing adsorption (VPSA) and they can produce 90-93% purity oxygen at reasonable costs (~$50 to $70 per ton), but not high-purity oxygen, which does not meet DOE target. This proposed project addresses this specific need. Our technology concept involves use of a novel 1-stage/2-layer rapid cycle PSA (RPSA) process using unique fiber structured adsorbents to both enhance the oxygen productivity of a conventional PSA system (thus reducing the overall capital and operating cost) and enable the production of required high purity (&gt;95%) for oxygen. The introduction of a unique argon (Ar)- selective cellulose-derived carbon molecular sieve (CMS) fiber, following a first layer of LiX fiber, ensures the effective and thorough adsorptive-purification of air to cost-effectively produce high purity oxygen. In SBIR Phase 1 of this project, we plan to build on our developed LiX and CMS-based fiber adsorbents for N2- and Ar-selective adsorption. Pyrolysis carbonation conditions will be screened to optimize Ar-selectivity for the cellulose-derived CMS materials. The dual-layer fiber modules will be tested in a lab-scale RPSA unit to measure adsorption breakthrough and O2 purity to obtain necessary engineering design data and confirm techno-economic analysis. A 10 kg O2/day prototype system is planned to be designed, built, and tested in the SBIR Phase 2. Its successful demonstration will pave the way for our design and deployment of a 10-50 ton/day commercial modular system to meet the DOE’s goal for distributed power production of 1 to 5 MW, in collaboration with our partners, Georgia Institute of Technology and Generon. The anticipated benefits of the proposed technology will be development of a cost-effective modular high purity oxygen production technology for a number of industrial applications (such as medical oxygen supply and wastewater treatment, etc.) in addition to modular gasification for clean hydrogen and negative carbon emissions.

As 2D and 4D STEM detectors and scan generators continue to increase in speed, distortions in the acquired data have become increasingly evident due to these adverse characteristics of scan coils. One potential solution is to substitute these electromagnetic coils with alternatives with improved high-speed characteristics. While such a solution may be beneficial for new STEM instruments, it will likely be costly and disruptive—if not altogether impractical—to modify the large number of existing STEM instruments with new types of beam deflectors.We propose developing a new distortion-corrected scan generator based on our new ultra-fast digital scan controller called DE-FreeScan, which differs from most other scan controllers in that it enables the use of unconventional/arbitrary scan patterns and has fine control over the output voltages sent to the electron microscopes scan coils. This system will measure distortions present in the scan coils based on STEM acquisitions of calibration specimens. A model will be developed to account for distortions present in any arbitrary probe movement. Then, the output voltages from the scan generator for each scan point will be perturbed to compensate for the measured distortions during STEM acquisitions. During Phase I, Direct Electron will acquire STEM images of calibration specimens using DE-FreeScan with a variety of dwell times and three different scan patterns: raster, serpentine, and rectangular spiral. The distortion field for each image will be calculated using several methods, including optical flow analysis and the sampling moir&#233; method. Data acquired at different dwell times will be used to model the time constants of the microscope lenses. The distortion field model will be verified by post-processing ultra-fast STEM images. Finally, for the three specific scan patterns tested in Phase I, the scan generator output voltages will be perturbed according to the calculated model, allowing correction of scan distortions in hardware during acquisition instead of by software in post-processing. The resulting distortion-corrected STEM scan generator will enable low-distortion ultra-fast conventional and 4D STEM, while giving users the freedom to use any desired scan pattern. Critically, such a system would be compatible with nearly all existing STEM microscopes, without requiring expensive and disruptive changes to the microscope column.",  ,,,,Benjamin  Bammes,,(858) 384-0291,bbammes@directelectron.com,,  ,

With all the recent progress, one key system of the microscope, the scanning system, has fallen behind. The proposed development will introduce a fundamentally new type of scanning system that replaces slow electromagnetic scans with faster, more precise, electrostatic scanning. The capabilities of the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) have expanded tremendously in recent years, to the point that individual atom’s identity and lattice dynamics can now be probed by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). These capabilities are enabled and accelerated by technical developments in aberration correction, electron detectors, monochromators, spectrometers, and open-source software. Throughout this renaissance, the scanning system itself – a key component of every STEM - has remained relatively constant. To overcome the current limitations, a fundamentally new approach is required—replacing slow electromagnetic scan coils with electrostatic scanning. Phase I work will consist of proof-of- principle experiments and calculations leading toward the design of a practical, marketable electrostatic scanning system for STEM for building in Phase II. In Phase I, a prototype electrostatic scan system will be designed, built, and tested.

(2) fast control electronics—existing electromagnetic scan control electronics will be extensively modified to enable electrostatic scanning for testing low noise deflection voltages over a wide range of magnifications at high speed. (3) software—to match the hardware capabilities and with architecture and API providing advanced users access to arbitrary scans quickly and efficiently.

At present, direct detection is well-suited for biological cryo-EM, where illumination is relatively uniform and the electron exposure rate is limited. However, many structural biology experiments make use of lower magnifications to acquire large areas of multicellular tissues, resulting in high illumination on the camera. This is further compounded when the specimen is stained and thus can tolerate a much higher total exposure. Other experiments, such as micro-crystal electron diffraction (microED) or electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), also produce high illumination levels on certain pixels of the camera. In all these cases, high illumination often exceeds the capabilities of current direct detectors. We propose developing a new large-format (4096&#215;4096), high-speed direct detection camera with fully rad- hard pixels and high dynamic range (HDR). This new camera will make use of fully rad-hard design principles that have been successfully developed in the high-energy physics community to prevent most radiation damage on the detector. Additionally, the camera will include simultaneous high-dynamic range (HDR) acquisition to enable capture of high illumination without sacrificing sensitivity to single electrons. During Phase I, Direct Electron will characterize the radiation hardness and lifetime of its new fully rad-hard direct detection pixel design, as implemented in a small ultra-fast 1k&#215;1k sensor and demonstrate the use of this sensor for acquisition of high brightness TEM data, including tomography of stained biological specimens and high-speed microED without the use of a beamstop. In parallel, Direct Electron will identify and evaluate potential hardware solutions for transferring large-readout-area (4k x 4k) data to the end-user computer at very high speed (several-fold higher data rates than any of our current cameras), which will be necessary for the camera system to be developed and implemented in Phase II of this project. Successful development of a fully rad-hard high dynamic range direct detection camera will dramatically expand the capabilities of electron microscopy by significantly increasing both spatial and temporal resolution under high brightness conditions, including large-area tomography of multicellular biological specimens, high-speed microED, and EELS. Such a camera would obsolete the large number of indirect scintillator-coupled cameras currently used for these experiments.",  ,,,,Benjamin  Bammes,,(858) 384-0291,bbammes@directelectron.com,,  ,

Proposed coating materials must survive thermo-mechanical loading (e.g., no flaking or spalling) during exposure to the high-temperature conditions encountered during reactor operation and maintain metallurgical stability with no diffusion-induced composition changes or aging over extended time-durations. NanoCoatings, Inc.

Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) scientists will be consulted to confirm cladding and substrate materials selection, candidate component geometries, DOE-Laboratory or University sources for molten-salt exposures, and selection of components for Wire-AM demonstration (in Phase II). These unique Wire-AM fabrication methods offer several attractive features, including:
1) high deposition rate of high-density material with good material utilization, 2) reduced contamination and porosity compared to powder-based AM methods, 3) excellent bond strength to the underlying substrate, 4) low-cost equipment suitable for large geometry processing, 5) ability to control heat-input to reduce part distortion, and 6) robotic control to ensure uniform clad deposits. Haynes 244 wire material for Wire-AM method comparison will be provided by Haynes Corporation. CSM will perform GMAW to demonstrate feasibility of this AM method, while Kymera will utilize their TWAS method. In general, both methods produce melted material that is transferred and bonds with the substrate with microstructures resembling those of cast products, dendritic/columnar and graded to the substrate. We will coordinate with Haynes personnel to determine if post-process heat-treatment will be required. In Phase I, flat-substrates of ASME qualified material (e.g., IN617) will be clad by the Wire-AM methods with Pure Ni and Haynes 244 to enable tooling and process-parameter development and to provide coupons for characterization and testing. NanoCoatings, Inc. employees will utilize South Dakota Mines (SDM) equipment to characterize / test Wire-AM clad materials under an equipment user-fee arrangement. This will include: 1) NDE x-radiography or ultrasonic C-scan (at South Dakota State) for interface bond-integrity and defect/porosity characterization, 2) Optical metallography as a complementary assessment of bond quality, defects/porosity, and microstructure; 3) X-ray diffraction for phase identification, 4) Adhesive pull tests for deposit bond-strength, and 5) Corrosion/oxidation in high-temperature air. After demonstration of Wire-AM deposited materials on flat surfaces, equipment design modifications will be identified in Phase I to enable cladding of pipe or container internal surfaces in Phase II. Phase II planning will include identification of a facility for molten-salt corrosion-exposures (e.g., ORNL, other DOE- Laboratories (e.g., Idaho National Laboratory), or University (Virginia Tech)) on Wire-AM processed flat and curved coupons.

State-of-the-art thermal and cold neutron sources are large expensive national facilities, which serve diverse community of scientific and industrial users. The constant need to improve the instruments performance, stems from the fact that neutron methods are gaining in popularity, and becoming more and more powerful, while new neutron sources are not being constructed to keep pace with the developments and needs of the scientific community. Small research reactors at universities and National Labs, and laboratory-based neutron generators, are necessary not only for education and training, but also when samples cannot be transported to other facilities. However, the standard neutron techniques, which were developed for high-flux facilities, require much higher efficiencies to be used effectively with the low fluxes of small sources. Thus, the efficient use of neutron sources, such as with our proposed compact, portable single-crystal diffractometer, is important for the progress and broader use of these neutron techniques. We propose to design and demonstrate a compact, portable single-crystal neutron diffractometer, which will enable fast characterization of small samples. Our proposed device will be designed with off-the-shelf parts in a similar manner as the instrument CYCLOPS at ILL with eight flat detectors surrounding a sample in an octagonal shape. Our proposed device will be capable of being placed on available neutron beamlines at large neutron facilities such as SNS or HFIR as well as small research reactors at universities and laboratory neutron sources. Our diffractometer will enable very fast screening of new samples as they are developed. The outcome of our project would be the demonstration of a portable, compact single-crystal diffractometer with integrated software to characterize small samples. Our proposed instrument could be installed at unused beamlines at national facilities or small neutron sources and then moved into storage when not in use. The development of our new instrument will take a step in bringing neutron scattering techniques to a broader audience that has mostly relied on the availability and ease-of-use of laboratory X-ray diffractometers.",  ,,,,Jay  Cremer,,(650) 283-3350,ted@adelphitech.com,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Boris  Khaykovich,

To achieve this, techniques are needed to coherently convert between the microwave states used by the qubits and optical states required for long-distance communication, a conversion that needs to occur at cryogenic temperature (&lt; 100 mK). This is an active field of research that follows several parallel technicalities, which are hampered by one common bottleneck: the ability to efficiently couple light between optical fibers and Photonic Integrated Circuit (PIC) waveguides. The inefficiency of current coupling schemes not only reduces the fidelity of the interconversion by photon loss, but light scattered from fiber-to-chip interfaces is highly detrimental to qubits and other superconducting circuit elements that are needed for the interconversion process. HighRI Optics Inc., in collaboration with Molecular Foundry at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and BBN Raytheon, proposes to develop a novel lensed fiber for efficient fiber-to-chip coupling. The high refractive index lens will be imprinted on a single-mode fiber facet with an in-house fiber imprinter. Such a lens can still function in polymer mediums used for photonic packaging and can efficiently focus light into the waveguide while bonded at room or cryogenic temperature. This method can lead to low-cost manufacturing to accelerate commercialization, and the method is broadly adaptable for the photonic packaging community. Packaging of integrated photonic circuits (PIC) or miniaturized medical devices requires tedious placement and active alignment of the various micro-optical elements to each other. Coupling losses lead to significant contributions to the link power budget for digital computing and communications applications.

As microscope stages improve, it will become possible to capture these dynamics in three dimensions (3D) by repeatedly acquiring rapid continuous rotation tomography data. However, such data requires complex image processing to generate interpretable reconstructions of the specimen from the gluttony of acquired data. At present, the vast majority of this processing occurs after data acquisition has been completed, precluding the user from monitoring the specimen in real-time and hindering automation via tools such as machine learning. While a few national laboratories have successfully developed systems to transfer data in real-time to on- site supercomputing resources for processing, such solutions are untenable for the vast majority of TEM labs. To resolve these challenges and enable real-time reconstruction and feedback, we propose to provide direct access to high-speed camera data in GPU memory, in a format that can be readily used by custom image processing algorithms. To prevent competition for computing resources with data acquisition, this direct real- time access to camera data in GPU memory will use a second computer connected through an ultra-high- speed interface to the camera computer. An open API will be developed to enable community development. During Phase I, we will develop and demonstrate an application programming interface (API) that enables direct access to processed frames from our DE-16 camera system in shared memory on an Nvidia graphics card (GPU) in the camera computer system. Additionally, we will develop a prototype system in which data from the camera computer can be transferred to a GPU on a second computer. The bandwidth and network transfer overhead of this prototype system will be evaluated to prepare for expansion, optimization, and commercialization of this system in Phase II. The resulting add-on GPU-based platform will enable immediate feedback for complex electron microscopy experiments such as continuous-rotation tomography, which is invaluable to microscopists as they investigate dynamic specimens.

Aerosol size distributions are specifically named by DOE as a parameter that cannot be affordably monitored with currently available methods. The size and concentration of sub-micrometer and ultrafine aerosols are especially critical to evaluating the dynamics of aerosol processes, to identifying sources and origins of new particles and their role in cloud formation, as well evaluating human exposures important to health. Needed are means to map these concentrations with good time and spatial resolution.Vehicle-based platforms, such as instrumented Google street-view cars or mobile monitors, provide air quality data over a large urban environment. However, such ground-based mobile platforms require rapid time response, of the order of one second, as the sampled aerosol is constantly changing. For the critical ultrafine aerosol size range, which cannot be directly measured optically but instead is probed by electrical mobility, the current commercial methods do not have the necessary time resolution. Our approach separates airborne particles spatially in accordance with their electrical mobility, and then counts these particles as a function of their position (and hence size) through condensational growth and optical imaging. The complete size spectrum 10-500 nm size is captured with 10Hz resolution, making feasible accurate measurements on moving platforms.AMI technology uses an innovative approach to facilitate high time resolution measurements within a compact instrument size, representing a significant advance over existing commercially available technologies. Our Phase I project will experimentally evaluate three key components of this approach. First, we experimentally verify the capability of accurately capturing particle positions across the full width of the mobility separator. Second, we will determine the capacity for simultaneous measurement of positive and negative particle mobilities, as this approach has recently been shown to eliminate the need for bipolar ion source. Third, we will evaluate a new concept for the wide-size size range electrode, which has the potential to greatly reduce the required size and cost of the separator. These key steps will allow us in Phase II to design for cost-effective fabrication methods. Through establishing the efficacy of this innovative approach, we aim to provide a compact and affordable instrument for rapid, 1Hz, aerosol size distribution measurement over the critical size range of fine and ultrafine aerosols.Commercial applications span a wide range of industrial and laboratory research uses for which rapid measurements of aerosol size distributions are needed, such as near sources or on mobile platforms.

Flexible neutron shielding is only available through commercial vendors which utilize Boron-10 as the neutron absorber which generates secondary gamma radiation that decreases measurement sensitivity through background contamination. Areas that require neutron radiation shielding for scientific research including development of new energy storage technologies, biomedical imaging, and deep space missions, are constantly striving for environments where measurements of higher sensitivity can be performed, which our shielding product will provide. A flexible neutron shielding material will be developed that produces minimal secondary gamma radiation. The material will utilize Lithium-6 as the neutron absorber in a polyethylene-based resin.

As this transition progresses, many companies have started to re-purpose existing, aging assets. This re-purposing of aging assets can be prominently seen in the areas of biofuels processing and in hydrogen and carbon dioxide transmission pipelines. A core issue with repurposing aging assets lies in the often-overlooked complex piping systems and offsite piping networks that serve as the vascular network of any industrial processing operation. A leading driver of change in these industries is real world incidents that lead to the creation of new regulations governing the safe operation and management of these complex piping networks. Often, the industry’s software tools, management plans, and best practices lag any new regulations that are introduced. Common events, such as pump failures, in these complex networks can cause pressure pulsations or shocks that can catastrophically damage the downstream piping systems, leading to failure and environmental disaster. With the increasing complexity of modern-day piping systems and the multimodal demands that these systems face, improved simulation methods for predicting transient damage have never been more of a necessity in this ever-changing energy arena. To help Process Engineers accurately simulate upset conditions in complex piping networks, we will develop a scalable hydraulic transient software suite: SimPulse. The novelties of SimPulse are twofold: 1) a scalable backend that can manage a diverse range of event-driven transient phenomena in complex networks, and 2) a pipe-engineer tailored interface via our Standard Piping Language (SPL) input format that has been highly successful in our other commercial pipe-stress engineering products. The key challenge of modeling a piping network is the complex interconnection of pipes, junctions, valves, and fittings, coupled with the various event-driven phenomena that can occur, e.g., valve and pump failures, rapid phase transitions, and bursts. All these complexities require any simulation engine to be able to manage the computational scalability in both spatial and temporal contexts. Accurate simulation of hydraulic events is critical to the understanding of potential damage and the risk of rupture events causing widespread environmental damage. By connecting the hydraulic picture with the atmospheric plumes of leaks and bursts, this project will give a more accurate description of the overall risk landscape. The integration of high-performance computing libraries will allow scalability in this application domain not previously possible. At its core, SimPulse will solve hydraulic transients in complex piping networks, both in the normal operating state as well as after the occurrence of transient events. It will then relate this transient picture to potential damage via stress analysis, and risk mitigation. SimPulse will ensure that piping systems are safely code complaint, regardless of their complexity.",  ,,,,Donald  Brown,,(216) 658-2224,dbrown@e2g.com,,  ,

At the same time, an even larger amount of neutron optics will be required to build the new European Spallation Source in Sweden. These concurrent projects are stretching existing neutron manufacturers, all of which are presently located in Europe, beyond their capacities, thus presenting a unique opportunity for new American manufacturers. American Physics and Technology LLC (APT) is striving to become a trusted domestic supplier for these critically needed optics, one that manufactures the highest quality supermirror optics and competes on price as well. In our previous SBIR project, APT located in Richmond UT, with its suppliers: Rigaku Innovative Technologies (RIT) in Auburn Hills MI a worldwide leader in thin film deposition; Inrad Optics in Northvale NJ with 40+ years of expertise in manufacturing substrates for x-ray optics; and Exogenesis in Billerica MA, an innovator in atomic-scale surface modification technology; manufactured the first American made neutron supermirrors in &gt;20 years. This new proposed SBIR project will increase our capability to mass-produce low-cost conventional neutron guides, mirrors, and filters on flat substrates. In phase-I, we will: a) develop M=4 thin-film coatings, on small coupon samples, to achieve 80% neutron reflectivity at max q, to be measured at the SNS at ORNL; b) research the manufacture of substrates as large as 1000x150 mm made of glass, silicon, and metal, and with special attention to optimizing the surface quality and lowering cost; c) consider the technology and cost required for manufacturing the adjustable mounts and housings that are also required for the mirror assemblies. In phase-II we will demonstrate our ability to manufacture the required meter-sized optics. To date, we have made neutron supermirrors on glass, Si-crystal, and metal substrates, and our first attempts have already demonstrated M=4.5 performance with 75% neutron reflectivity at maximum q on a flat Si-crystal substrate. Our previous effort centered on making low-volume, high-cost, curved, metal, focusing mirrors using our proprietary cluster-beam surface-smoothing technologies. Our proposed project will add low-cost, high-volume, neutron optics to our product line. Our goal is to compete with the existing European suppliers using conventional manufacturing methods and by using our new innovative cluster-beam methods.

Nonetheless, ongoing manufacturing and metrology challenges associated with beamline focusing mirrors prevent the light sources from reaching their full potential. While the average brightness of synchrotron radiation sources is increasing, the utilization of this increase in brightness is held back by the quality of the beamline optics [2]. Currently, OptiPro has a Phase I SBIR underway for increasing the surface quality of specific beamline optics utilizing Elastic Emission Machining (EEM) to polish Kirkpatrick-Baez (K-B) mirrors. In this proposal we present an exciting ultra-precision optics polishing method based on the EEM method that, we believe, will greatly improve the surface figure and roughness of the other X-ray mirrors used in those beamlines, specifically the interior surfaces of the Wolter Mirrors. The current EEM method is not capable of polishing these interior surfaces, but a novel Fluid Jet Polishing Elastic Emission Machining (FJPEEM) system proposed herein, will be capable of just that.

Of particular concern is the near wellbore formation integrity of GBES systems that are subject to Thermal-Hydraulic-Mechanical-Chemical (THMC) loading conditions: during injection, storage, and production cycles. If operational parameters of GBES Systems are not optimized with data unique to sedimentary formations, near wellbore formation integrity issues can lead to reduced heat output and significantly delay commercialization targets. Formation integrity issues can cause wellbore instabilities, flow anomalies, injection/production problems, excessive horse-power requirements and even equipment breakdown. To optimize GBES systems in sedimentary formations and to avoid near wellbore formation integrity issues, this project proposes to develop an integrated characterization and coupled modeling workflow. The workflow will consider key THMC characteristics of sedimentary formations within the framework of coupled analytical and numerical models. Results will identify impact of formation and operational parameters on near wellbore formation integrity and wellbore operability limits. Based on the modeling results, we will demonstrate the feasibility of optimizing operational parameters while minimizing potential formation damage to maximize the heat output from GBES systems. The growth of the global thermal energy storage market is backed by increasing demand for electricity during peak hours, increasing commercialization of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, and demand for heating &amp; cooling applications for residential, industrial and infrastructure structures. The economic viability of GBES systems still depends heavily on operational constraints, including the number and frequency of storage cycles while maintaining the formation integrity and a healthy energy output. This project will result in a new, marketable, integrated characterization and modeling workflow to optimize GBES operations in sedimentary formations. Optimized GBES systems represent a flexible and in-demand energy storage asset class that, when paired with grid-scale intermittent renewable facilities, have the potential to disrupt current renewable energy markets and empower a rapid shift to net-zero in our energy generation infrastructure. This proposal targets optimization of operational parameters (including characteristics of storage cycles) to minimize and mitigate near wellbore risks associated with GBES system operations. Phase-II involves a collaboration with our commercial partner EarthBridge Energy LLC to further advance Phase I characterization and modeling workflows during and after a field demonstration of their GeoBatteryTM. Phase-III involves developing a commercial software product which allows non-specialists to run coupled THMC models, democratizing the use of high-end modeling technology within a wider user base.

The field of quantum photonics is continually developing and devices are being fabricated on scalable integrated photonic platforms, including silicon-on-insulator and silicon nitride. However, the heterogeneous integration of quantum photonic devices with optical fibers presents a challenge: The inherent insertion loss or limited coupling efficiency between chip and fiber limits the exchange of quantum information. While such insertion losses are typically overcome in classical photonics by simply increasing the power of the light source, this is not an option for quantum devices that operate at the level of single photons. The fact that quantum light sources and photon detectors may operate at cryogenic temperatures further complicates the fiber packaging problem. Low-loss coupling and packaging structures optimized for room temperature operation will experience deleterious reductions in coupling coupling efficiency owing to differential thermal contraction and shifts in temperature dependent refractive indices of the package and photonic circuit materials. As a result, there is a need for new fiber-chip photonic packaging solutions that can achieve low insertion loss over a wide temperature range. At memQ, we are developing quantum internet technologies based on rare earth ion (REI) optical transitions that operate in the telecom C-band. These sources of single photons and potential quantum memories are integrated directly with silicon photonic circuits, enabling the scalable fabrication of devices for managing quantum entanglement at the network-level, e.g., quantum repeaters. We have identified high insertion loss as a critical challenge to be overcome for the development of the quantum internet, and we have teamed up with Freedom Photonics, a leading laser manufacturer in California, to tackle this challenge. In Phase I of this SBIR, we will address two engineering challenges for low-loss cryogenic photonic packaging: (1) thermomechanical stability of the fiber-chip package and (2) Optical mode mismatch between photonic waveguides and fibers. We will address these challenges using the novel packaging technique of photonic wirebonding (PWB) in which flexible waveguides can be 3D-printed between chip and fiber. Freedom Photonics operates the first PWB tool in the US. Using PWB and thermally-engineered packaging, we seek to demonstrate insertion losses less than 3 dB at 4 K, at parity with those achieved at room temperature. The focus of Phase II will be to push for smaller insertion losses, to integrate our Er-doped photonic cavity devices with this new packaging, and to network devices together in two separate cryostats. This improved packaging will enable more efficient single photon sources. Based on our discussions with over 100 stakeholders in the community, these single photon sources would be valuable to researchers and engineers working on quantum networking and computing. Further, improved optical packaging will have considerable impact on the photonics industry, which is expected to approach $1 trillion in value by 2028.",  ,,,,Sean  Sullivan,,(513) 373-6645,sean@memq.tech,,  ,

An ongoing need with the operating reactor fleet is the performance of radiation fluence analyses to assess the lifetime remaining for reactor components. In addition to being time consuming, fluence analyses are performed with many approximations that require significant conservatism to maintain margin to material exposure limits. This has implications for many reactors where there is high interest to extend reactor lifetimes. Most reactors have already extended their lifetime to 60 years with a number seeking to extend lifetimes to 80 and possibly 100 years. The current conservatism of 10-15% in estimated fluence can have a profound effect on large component lifetime. The value of extending a nuclear reactor’s life is estimated at $300 million per year of extended operation. Fluence analyses are also the basis for component inspections and maintenance schedules and applies to in-vessel structures such as control blades, baffle bolts, and upper reactor vessel internals. The periodicity of such inspections is a significant maintenance expense for operating reactors that could be reduced with less uncertainty in calculated fluence values. This proposal seeks to develop a broadly applicable, first-of-a-kind computational capability to identify, quantify and potentially eliminate excess margin in existing fluence analyses leveraging advanced computing. The key advantage of the methodology is that it integrates high-resolution, high-fidelity predictions for all reactor core radiation source terms (neutron and gamma) in conjunction with highly accurate 3-dimensional radiation transport simulations. Through modeling of the as-built and as-loaded fuel loading patterns over the operating history of the reactor, higher accuracy of source terms with reduced uncertainties in predicted fluence will be achieved. Incorporation of 3-dimensional digital representations of reactor components and structures with the modeling and simulation capabilities will allow for Just-In-Time calculations of fluence to be performed for any region of materials concern both within and external to the reactor. Advanced analysis for beltline vessel fluence and excore response has been demonstrated using recently developed state-of-the-art capabilities for the reactor core and radiation transport. The technology has already been demonstrated for beltline vessel fluence and was shown to have an accuracy of &lt; 2% when compared with measured fluence coupon data. In Phase 1 of this proposal, the focus will be to extend this capability to integrate the geometry necessary to accurately represent the upper and lower internals and provide a streamlined methodology to extract the fluence for all regions. This capability will be demonstrated by partnering with a utility that is currently requiring upper internal surveillance during outages. Phase 2 will generalize to incorporate 3-D digital representations of all structures within core as well as ex-core structural materials allowing any region of concern to be modeled with high resolution.",  ,,,,Benjamin  Collins,,(865) 816-3465,ben.collins@veracitynuclear.com,,  ,

The limiting factor for fast acquisition of ET data is stage instability causing drift in all directions while tilting. Because ET requires many images taken within the exact same field of view, performance is further compromised by the quickly accumulating sample dose and a lack of tools to quantify dose for samples moving through 3D space. Achieving an order-of-magnitude performance improvement over existing solutions requires new technologies that innovate across multiple fronts including: 1) machine vison software that controls the goniometer and beam position to compensate for drift, 2) a method to accurately define and control accumulated dose for the sample area despite physical movement and 3) in situ holder designs that allows for higher degrees of tilt while still leveraging the advantages of MEMS technologies. The proposed Computationally Mediated Tomography (CMT) system will enable fast continuous tomography of samples on MEMS heating/biasing chips supporting a variety of in situ experiments. The Phase I effort will deliver a proof-of-concept machine vision solution that completely stabilizes the 3D movement of the sample while continuously tilting the goniometer using an off-the-shelf tomography holder.

Such scientific endeavors require powerful visualization workflows as a fundamental step to understanding and interpreting big data. An ideal data visualization workflow should provide scientists with a fast and intuitive tool to explore data interactively, identify interesting patterns, observe anomalies, and gain rapid insights into their unique discovery and decision- making processes. In many numerical simulations, e.g., geochemical and geophysical processes, multidimensional data attributes are acquired in 3D volumetric space with multiscale, disparate, and time- dependent dimensions. Despite many advances in visualizing massive volumetric datasets, the lack of an efficient data pipeline inhibits users from rapid visual interactions with the data. It is hypothesized that terabytes of 4D volumetric data can be stored, interpolated, and visualized interactively in real-time (i.e., 60 frame-per-second response) on consumer computers. This will be explored by transforming the data from a discrete form to a continuous form using context-aware implicit neural representations that reduce memory consumption by up to three orders of magnitude while keeping the rendering rate at 60 frame-per-second. The networks will be then converted into GPU program to construct a direct volumetric data rendering pipeline. Our technology, dubbed as neural-accelerated volumetric visualization, NAV2, relaxes the requirements of high-performance computing setup for visualizing big volumetric data, and establishes an intelligent, context-aware data rendering pipeline to explore complex scientific data across all scales interactively in real-time.

State of the art and future systems have to detect as few as a single Cherenkov photon in a high multiplicity environment with the best possible efficiency and with excellent time resolution. Photomultipliers (PMTs) and their variants are used but they suffer from strong sensitivity to magnetic fields and therefore force a complicated mechanical design. The transit time spread of standard PMTs is 250 ps or more which limits the achievable time resolution. Therefore, a strong need remains for a small size, compact, high rate, and magnetic field tolerant photo detector, such needs may be met by properly designed solid state devices. Due to magnetic field sensitivity of PMTs, a complex bulky design is used to avoid noise which limits the lifetime and range of applications. Thus, opportunities exist for magnetic field tolerant materials, especially for the semiconductors. While, Si based single photon counters are used, their response to UV light (the emission due to high energy particles is in the UV and deep UV region) is poor. Therefore, we propose the use of III-Nitride-based materials (thanks to their bandgap tunability from 206 nm to IR) single photon detector (SPD) developing p-i-n InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well avalanche photodiodes (APD) is highly feasible. The efficiency of III-Nitride based SPD-APD will be improved by suppressing the threading dislocations of structure by incorporating an AlGaN based superlattice. The dark current will also be suppressed by suppressing the threading dislocations, ultimately reducing the unwanted recombination sites. The overall effect of reducing dark current channels will lead to high single photon detection efficiency (SPD). In Phase II, our device will be waterproof packaged and will be used for Cherenkov light detection followed by image development demonstrating RICH. In Phase III, we will market such packaged devices. In Phase I, we will start from GaN growth on sapphire substrates and conduct the characterizations such as AFM, HRD, and Hall Effect measurements. After achieving high crystal quality, n-type GaN will be grown using Si as dopant followed by InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well structures optimized for absorption below 450 nm. Then a p-type GaN layer will be grown using Mg as a p-type dopant to form the p-i-n avalanche photodiode. The avalanche photodiode will be operated in linear mode to use as single photon detector. We will form an array of SPD-APDs that are ~25 &#215; 25 &#181;m2 over the area of a 100 mm substrate. The proof-of-concept device will be demonstrated at the end of Phase I. The single photon detection efficiency will be used as feedback to refine the design and device structure for Phase II proposal/work.

Plato is enabled by Advanced Scientific Computing Research libraries (e.g., Trilinos, Kokkos, OpenMPI, Spack, Dakota, and many more) to facilitate automated workflows in high-performance computing environments. While Plato provides performance portable multiphysics simulation, design under uncertainty, and design for additive manufacturing capabilities, its use often requires a specialist.

Phaedo would include a friendly web-based graphical user interface to facilitate problem setup, job submission, and visualization activities, including cloud deployment. We will also develop and document the forward and adjoint solvers needed to analyze the physics describing the behavior of solar cells and compute the total derivatives driving the optimization problem. Phaedo will then be employed to address cell efficiency, silver usage reduction, and metal contact reliability in solar cells – some of the most pressing engineering challenges in the solar community today. In particular, we will optimize the metal contact (also known as gridlines and fingers) design on solar cells to simultaneously maximize the current collection and therefore cell efficiency, minimize the usage of metal for manufacturing cost reduction, and minimize the stress in the metal contacts in response to external thermomechanical stress. Combined together, our approach would mitigate the stress-induced module degradation, such as cell cracks that typically propagate through the metal contacts, creating ‘dead areas’ in the solar cell. At the end of Phase I, we will demonstrate that the optimized metal contact design can, in fact, improve cell efficiency with a comparable or reduced usage of metal, and provide tolerance to stress that mimics inclement weather conditions. With a successful transition to Phase II, we will demonstrate the impact of our optimized metal contact design at the full-sized module level for its improved efficiency and reliability.

Repair and remediation operations are particularly challenging for these wellbores because of the range of types and conditions of wells; the widely varying leakage pathways encountered; the harsh environmental conditions that degrade most conventional materials; and the need to be effective for a very long time. A system is being proposed for repair and remediation of wellbores associated with CO2 storage facilities. The cornerstone of the proposed system is an extremely durable nano-modified polymer that will penetrate and seal very small but problematic leakage pathways as well as bond to and protect steel casing. In Phase I, the polymer will be modified to decrease its viscosity and extend its gel time to extend its utility for repair and remediation operations such as squeeze jobs and casing repair for wells associated with CO2 storage facilities. Using this polymer, a polymer modified cement with superior durability, flexibility and strength will also be developed in Phase I to replace the use of conventional cements in repair and remediation operation. In addition, the technical feasibility of an alternative delivery system for the polymer sealant using environmentally sensitive microcapsules will be established in Phase I. This delivery system can be used to engineer effective repair and remediation applications. A commercialization plan for the new repair system will be executed to aid in bringing the technology to the market. The key components of the system will be developed in Phase I. Phase II will include accelerated longevity testing of the system components under extreme environmental conditions, scaling of the microcapsule fabrication process to a commercial scale, and lab and field verification of the system effectiveness. The system will be available to be deployed in the increasing number of CO2 sequestration demonstrations, pilot operations, and commercial projects throughout the US and the world. There will be many wells associated with these facilities as many potential locations are located in formations that have numerous wellbores from previous oil and gas production – so-called legacy wells. It is in the best interest of the public and owners/operators of the wells to use a repair and remediation system that has been developed specifically for the challenges of these wells. In addition, a system that addresses the range of issues and conditions that may be encountered translates to more efficient and less costly field operations.",  ,,,,Daniel  Heras-Murcia,,(505) 355-8147,dhmurcia@ts-nano.com,,  ,

DOE Basic Energy Science Advisory Committee identifies synchrotron radiation sources as one of the five critical areas for basic energy science. They represent an enormous investment but also highly demanded advanced research facilities that play critical roles in the advance of both basic and applied science through their unique ability to analyze the structure and properties of materials. Our ability to utilize these ultrabright and coherent X-ray sources is limited by our ability to focus, monochromate, and manipulate X-rays with appropriate optics. In other words, diffraction-limited X-ray optics are necessary to make the most of these diffraction-limited radiation sources. However, on the battlefield for these research capabilities, US has been challenged in terms of the total number X-ray beamlines and the X-ray optics developments. US-based companies have barely any share in the market for high-precision and coherence-preserving X-ray optics. Argonne National Laboratory has invented a method of fabricating high-quality polymer-based refractive X-ray optics with the recently developed photon polymerization lithography technique. These refractive optics represent a very efficient and cost-effective domestic alternative, and they have already shown promise of outperforming commercial refractive optics for diffraction-limited applications. We expect a great potential for this technology to be adopted widely and become the basis of significant private sector investment. In this proposal, Argonne National Laboratory and Robot Nose Corporation (RN) will work together to commercialize this technology. We will center our effort on fast fabrication of high-resolution polymer compound refractive lenses for micro-focusing of hard-energy X-rays. Fast X-ray characterization methods will evaluate their performance for the optimization of the fabrication conditions. We also will commercialize our new concept of transfocator-on-chip, which enables the flexible usage of the optics for a broad experimental need at a competitive cost. Our polymer-based X-ray optics allows researchers to take the full advantage of the next-generation synchrotron radiation facilities for great scientific advances.

As communities look to tackle issues related to urban flooding and streamflow, automated sensors that are low-cost and easy to install will be crucial to monitoring and restoration efforts. The unique challenges posed by urban stream monitoring require an innovative approach to measuring hydrological parameters of interest including stage, discharge, and inundation events. The Hydrological Enduring Remote Observation Network (HERON) is being developed to meet these urgent requirements. HERON is a compact, low-cost solution that is designed to be easily and quickly installed at any urban location. It relies on remote sensing methodology, using a camera to capture imagery, an embedded processor to calculate stage, discharge, and inundation maps, and a cellular, wifi, or satellite modem to report results in real-time. HERON relies on a unique installation procedure, ensuring that multiple systems can be installed quickly and efficiently along any urban stream to create a network of systems. In Phase I, a proof-of-concept data collection system will be built to develop installation procedures, investigate different camera modalities and performance tiers, and gather relevant data for algorithm development. HERON algorithms will be refined and optimized for each camera and results will be compared to ground truth measurements. Using these results, a trade study and various system design concepts will be created to quantify performance versus cost for various system configurations. A low-cost, compact, easy-to-use system for monitoring streams will have many commercial applications and public benefits. HERON systems will provide most immediate value to researchers and scientists studying urban streams who currently are not able to collect as much data, and in as many locations, as they require. However, since the system will be portable and self-powered, it will also have wide application as a streamgage in rural, hard to access locations as well. The systems will find utility in monitoring areas that are prone to flooding, where stakeholders, such as local municipalities, can benefit more timely and accurate information affecting their localities. Additionally, in areas where inundation mapping is of particular concern (e.g., coastal cities or urban areas with poor drainage), HERON will provide a means to create a sensor network capable of providing flood maps in real-time to decision makers. By lowering the time and cost to set up a monitoring network, HERON provides a new tool for resource and environmental managers and planners to engage in routine, continuous monitoring of sites to ensure compliance with rules and regulations, assess current conditions, and make predictions about future conditions.",  ,,,,Seth  Zuckerman,,(571) 255-4080,szuckerman@arete.com,,  ,

First, depth imaging is limited by light scattering and diffraction in biological tissue. Second, classical high flux multiphoton optical imaging causes photo-damage to cellular viability and perturbations to molecular biological processes. This renders the sample unusable for repeated in situ imaging and prohibits measurements of dynamic biological processes within the same biological system over different time intervals. Technologies utilizing single photon detection, with the promise of very low photon fluxes, single photon sensing, time gated photon sensing and ghost imaging using entangled photon pairs capabilities, promise to directly address the above challenges and limitations. While there is considerable activity towards the development of quantum photon sources (e.g., solid state lasers and systems for generation of entangled photons), there is significantly less research and development devoted to quantum photon detectors, i.e., single photon avalanche photodetectors (SPADs). Further, efforts on SPADs have been solely limited to those operating in the visible and telecommunications bands, and not in the biologically important 2080-2340 nm band which is a local minimum in the optical absorption of H2O. SPADS operating at 2080-2340 nm are required for development of the next generation of quantum bioimaging system technology. In this DoE SBIR program, Amethyst Research will develop a technology that will be able to deliver a new class of photo detectors directly addressing the current ‘technology gap’ of SPADs operating in the 2080-2340 nm window.

Also, owing to the shallow implant design of the gain layer, the radiation tolerance of LGADs is limited.

A critical element in geologic carbon sequestration is monitoring, validation and accounting for the injected CO2 volume during and after injection. Controlled Source Electro-Magnetics (CSEM) is a geophysical technique that uses variations in electrical properties of reservoir rocks to map their fluid variations. Applied to oil and gas exploration, differences in resistivity between oil- or gas-filled reservoirs and brine-filled reservoirs can enable CSEM to image potential prospects. The reservoirs targeted for CO2 sequestration are typically brine-filled sandstone reservoirs, at depths greater than 4,500 ft. The free chloride ions contained in these reservoirs enable electric current to move with comparatively less resistance – the rocks are relatively conductive. The injection of CO2 into a brine-filled reservoir results in a solution of H2O, CO2, and chlorides (e.g., NaCl, KCl, or CaCl2) with substantially reduced conductivity (Boerner et al., 2015). The increase in resistivity is a consequence of the substantial reduction in free chloride ions present in solution, caused by the free ions binding to CO2 molecules. The change in resistivity can be an order of magnitude or more depending on the salinity of the brine, which presents a significant opportunity for measuring the extent of the CO2 brine solution plume. We have demonstrated that this can be measured in a pilot study within the DOE’s CarbonSAFE program (Brajas-Olalde et al., 2021; Strack et al., 2022a).The CSEM monitoring service would help ensure the safe and compliant operation of industrial scale CO2 storage facilities. Specifically, the CSEM system would enable operators of CCS facilities to make better judgements about the state and integrity of the storage formation, and prudent decisions on the safe operation of the facility. Additionally, the CSEM system can measure the extent of the CO2 brine plume, helping to ensure the safe operation of any storage facility, which is critical to the long-term effectiveness of carbon sequestration. The intent of the CSEM monitoring system is to complement active and passive seismic monitoring systems, to address the potential inability of seismic monitoring systems to image the extent of the CO2 brine plume. Passive and active seismic are proven imaging technologies for monitoring reservoir and caprock integrity, however there are legitimate concerns whether active seismic imaging can accurately measure the extent of the plume. CSEM imaging technology takes advantage of the large resistivity contrast between brine-filled reservoir rocks and reservoir rocks filled with a CO2 brine solution, compared to the relatively small difference in acoustic impedance between brine-filled reservoir rocks and reservoir rocks filled with a CO2 brine solution; thus, both technologies are complementary to each other.",  ,,,,Peter  Duncan,,(713) 395-2408,pduncan@microseismic.com,,  ,

We are addressing these specific issues in the proposed program with a goal of developing a compact, large solid angle coverage single crystal neutron diffractometer. The problem will be addressed by developing the desired diffractometer using truly hemispherical, portable thermal neutron detectors recently developed at RMD.

Conventional spectroscopic techniques, however, average thousands of non-sequential left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized spectra together before generating a circular dichroism spectrum, leading to long acquisition times and significant baseline drift in time-resolved experiments. These drawbacks limit the accessibility of time-resolved circular dichroism spectroscopy, and hampers efforts to develop new diagnostic platforms for the advancement of next-generation energy and communication technology. In this proposal, PSI proposes the modeling, design, and validation of a transient-grating, time-resolved circular dichroism module for background-free, wavelength-agnostic investigations of material chirality. This approach uses two, cross-polarized laser pulses to induce a transient grating in sample that deflects a third probe pulse if, and only if, the sample has a circular dichroism response at that wavelength. The lack of any electro- optical devices or bandwidth limiting optics in the transient grating approach allows for a versatile spectrometer aimed at making time-resolved circular dichroism an accessible diagnostic technique for next-generation material characterization. The Phase I program will involve the development of an instrument model, the initial optical design of the transient grating spectrometer, a validation experiment, and the design of a prototype module. The commercial application of the transient-grating, time-resolved circular dichroism model stems from the technique’s continued application in measuring the complicated spin-dynamics of advanced material systems.

The framework will leverage various ASCR-funded numerical packages thus offering improved efficiency relative to the existing state-of-the-practice commercial platforms. The proposed framework will be encoded into a suite of numerical tools – Network Risk Assessment Toolkit (NetRAT) for commercial deployment. During Phase I, PEC, with support from consultant Dr. Michael Shields, will develop Network-level Risk Assessment Module (NetLevRAM) that will utilize RMT-based technique and leverage various ASCR-funded libraries to exploit the structure of large, sparse matrices representing energy grids. A part of the technical approach will focus on careful manipulation of matrix algebra computations to estimate eigenvalue bounds for network risk assessment. Another focus will be on utilization of various ASCR-funded numerical packages, e.g., STRUMPACK, Trilinos, Dakota, and OpenMPI, to gain computational efficiency, and their integration with opensource package UQpy to develop an extensible commercial module ECMUQpy. The performance of the toolkit will be assessed across several computational platforms using testbed data. The feasibility of our proposed technology will be demonstrated during Phase I, and a Phase II effort will focus on advancing our network risk analysis algorithms, expanding our validation dataset, and building out the front-end graphical user interface (GUI) for the field-deployable platform. Our finished toolkit will be at market-ready status at the end of Phase II; interested users will be broad-ranging, from field engineers to energy grid stakeholders and local emergency response/planning personnel. We also envision a potentially broader user base comprising military and civilian critical infrastructure owners/users (e.g., NNSA sites, commercial NPPs, DOE, DOT, EPA).",  ,,,,Eric  Sammarco,,(512) 380-1988,esammarco@protection-consultants.com,,  ,

The largest bottleneck for quantum networking is optical loss, which reduces quantum information fidelity and occurs at the component and system- level interconnects. Developing ultra-low loss interconnects is critical for realizing quantum networks in the near term. To solve the challenge of ultra-low-loss optical interconnects, this program will develop a standard fiber to photonic chip connector based on gray-scale 3D printing. As more quantum technologies take advantage of photonic and electronic integrated circuits, we require techniques for efficiently extracting light off chip and into long-distance fibers that connect the network. Our gray-scale lithography approach provides the best control of connector geometries, optical interfaces, and refractive indices of any technology and thus will allow us to achieve the lowest optical losses and develop swappable design that are customized for different quantum platforms. In Phase I, we will leverage our ongoing work developing chip-based quantum technologies and 3D gray-scale printing to create ultra-low loss connectors between entangled-photon sources, quantum encoding and routing devices, and optical fibers. Combined, these elements comprise the foundation for implementing a quantum network. We will design, fabricate, and evaluate prototype connectors to demonstrate our capability. Phase I will target connecting two devices with &lt; 1 dB connection loss, which will pave the way for a Phase II effort that will target tens of devices with &lt; 0.5 dB loss at each interconnect. Our mode-converter technology will enable ultra-low loss optical interconnects between integrated chips and current fiber-based networks, greatly increasing the capacity of near-term quantum networks without the bottleneck of optical loss limiting the network scale. This approach will reduce infrastructure requirements to expedite development of some of the first quantum networks. These devices will become key components for every node within a quantum network, which will enable advanced quantum computing, secure communication, and distributed quantum sensing. Note that low-loss interconnects could also have a major role in classical telecommunications as well, increasing system efficiency and bandwidth.",  ,,,,Chad  Ropp,,(978) 738-8166,cropp@psicorp.com,,  ,

In concrete terms, these goals mean developing reactors that operate at increased temperatures without sacrificing safety, keeping costs low, and preventing proliferation and physical resistance vulnerabilities. These increased operating temperatures, however, drive accelerated failure of the engineering materials used in reactor construc- tion, and therefore remain out of reach for today’s materials technology. Broadly, the overarching objective for this Small Business Innovation Research effort is to evaluate the potential for improved reactor integrity by additively manufacturing S31600 high alloy steel (S316) and N06625 nickel super alloy (Ni 625) with enhanced strength and durability. The innovation driving this proposal comes from recent pro- gress in the engineering of functionally graded materials made with metal additive manufacturing, which use re- peated geometric patterns to enhance an engineered products’ performance. In Phase I of this effort, the team proposes to design and validate a functionally graded bimetal compatible with today’s metal additive manufacturing equipment and quantify its thermomechanical resilience. The technical data will directly inform a supporting computational design workflow for prototype iteration and improvement. At the completion of Phase I, the team anticipates having an advanced engineering material for service in next-genera- tion nuclear energy systems to be prototyped in further Phase II tests. If the technology is shown to be feasible, the team will commercialize an advanced material solution that reduces barriers currently preventing development of next-generation nuclear reactors by increasing high-temperature cor- rosion resistance. Specifically, the proposed technology will be used to fabricate components or subsystems such as heat exchangers, directly enabling more efficient energy generation. While heat exchangers are the initial com- mercial focus, the team remains open to additional customer-driven market opportunities to maximize commercial success. The public will benefit by an increase in a safe, durable, domestic power supply without the production of carbon dioxide emitting resources, which ensures a low-cost and abundant source of energy essential for maintaining the quality of life experienced by today’s citizens. Moreover, commercial success will lead to the creation of new advanced manufacturing jobs at the early stages of a nascent energy technology, and generation of signif- icant revenues from a global market.

To enable measurements of winds and aerosols in urban atmospheres Michigan Aerospace Corporation is proposing a Phase I effort to develop and test an atmospheric Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) optimized for measurements in the urban air boundary layer. The LiDAR instrument to be proposed will make range resolved measurements of horizontal and vertical winds at fine spatial and temporal resolution to capture dynamic eddy features prevalent in congested urban settings. The instrument will be designed to track aerosol motion from near the ground up to the top of the boundary layer with estimates of boundary layer height provided. The system will be designed for unattended operation in urban settings and will be comprised mainly of Commercial of the Shelf (COTS) components to improve instrument reliability in harsh urban settings and manage sensor costs. The proposed instrument will be a benefit not only to urban atmospheric science but also to the recently surging commercial opportunity of urban air mobility. Urban air traffic will need timely and local information about atmospheric conditions to ensure the safety of passengers and urban citizens which the LiDAR technology will be capable of providing. Flight planning and regulatory compliance will also benefit from the currently unavailable high resolution urban wind profile.

In this approach, an XFEL pulse (5-10 keV) serves as a pump, creating population inversion in a solid medium and resulting in highly coherent amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) radiation. This radiation can be further filtered and returned with an X-ray cavity for subsequent seeding, similarly to a conventional active medium laser oscillator. However, the focused high intensity X-ray pulses are destructive to the lasing medium in a single shot; thus, in an oscillator configuration, it is required for an active medium material to be replenished with a new fresh sample before the next shot on the sub-microsecond time scale. In Phase I, our proposed solution will use copper as the gain medium, lasing at Ka1 transition. In order to maximize the number of copper atoms in the interaction region, this device will use copper foil targets, and to ensure replenishment of the copper gain medium, it will be rotated up to a target velocity of 300m/s. The disk will be driven with high-speed electric motors and supported by high-speed low friction bearings in order to achieve the required velocities. The spindle topology, foil support frame and critical dynamic balancing systematics will be studied. At these high speeds imbalances can be caused by deviations in the angular mass distributions on the order of &lt;10 milligrams. Tradeoffs between a low friction low load air bearing solution and precision preloaded mechanical bearings will be studied. Alignment mechanisms and tolerance budgets will be established to ensure that the foil remains within the critical Rayleigh range of the pump laser. Considerations for operating conditions, such as atmosphere, gas or vacuum and a containment chamber with appropriately considered laser windows will be developed. A commercial version of the system may be utilized at multiple X-ray FEL facilities for ASE R&amp;D. In addition, with some modifications, the system can be applied in other areas where non-degradable diagnostics, or beam targets are intercepted by beams of photons or charged particles, when the intensity is destructive to the sample without rapid replenishment. Such scenarios are quite ubiquitous, including well familiar to RadiaBeam high speed interceptive beam diagnostics, as well as rotating anodes and collimators for high intensity industrial accelerators (i.e., such as required for FLASH radiation therapy).",  ,,,,Ron  Agustsson,,(310) 822-5845,agustsson@radiabeam.com,,  ,

Advanced machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are applied to automate the mining of zettabytes of internet data. However, the mining of the much more limited, highly heterogeneous, multimodal, disparate, uncertain, non-uniform, and unstructured scientific data requires specialized ML/AI algorithms that are not fully developed and not widely deployed. The development of such ML/AI methods is critical for many scientific problems. For example, we need to improve our fundamental understanding of the subsurface conditions and processes based on available geologic, geochemical, and geophysical data. These scientific advances are critical to addressing energy security and climate change issues facing our nation. We need to accelerate the development of our country’s green energy portfolio. We need to be able to extract energy from geothermal reservoirs for sustainable energy development. We need to be able to store energy generated by solar and wind farms in the subsurface. To address these demands, we will develop ML/AI methods and tools specifically designed to improve our understanding of complex subsurface processes impacting the flow of fluids and heat in the subsurface. We have the experience and skills to create these tools. We propose to develop commercial software, GeoML, for (1) characterization and parameterization of subsurface conditions and processes impacting the flow of fluids and heat, (2) discovery of hidden data signatures informing the spatiotemporal characteristics of these processes, and (3) optimization data acquisitions strategies, and (4) prediction of future states and reservoir behavior under different energy injection/extraction scenarios.

Our work will focus on geothermal extraction and energy storage. Many subsurface reservoirs are suitable and can be applied for both tasks. GeoML will be capable of evaluating site prospectivities and selecting optimal energy storage and extraction locations and strategies at site and regional scales (Phase I) and a national scale (Phase II). GeoML will utilize cloud computing and data management resources. We will develop commercial software (GeoML) providing user-friendly, fast, robust, and defensible tools for predicting geothermal extraction and energy storage. To achieve this, our tool will rely on ML analyses and an ML-developed fast simplified/reduced-order simulator for modeling subsurface conditions and energy extraction/storage prospectivity. We will process existing geologic, geochemical, and geophysical datasets collected under DOE-funded projects and available on DOE data-dissemination websites. In Phase II, we will execute aggressive market and technological research to meet the needs of our customers and advance production and commercialization. We will also demonstrate GeoML capabilities to address the energy security of our nation.

The global thermal energy storage market size is projected to reach $369 million by 2025, at a CAGR of 14.4%, from an estimated $188 million in 2020. Based on these market evaluations, we believe that investment in GeoML is a commercially valuable proposition. Currently, energy research is primarily limited to national laboratories, large academic institutions, and companies with extensive resources to invest in detailed exploration and production analyses. With the deployment and commercial use of GeoML, smaller companies and academic institutions, and even state-level/local governments and Native American tribes, could evaluate and develop their energy resources.

Most real-world applications involve chemical reaction networks in which many simultaneous chemical reactions of many species occur. Advances in high-performance computer simulations and laboratory automation provide an increasingly detailed picture of these chemical reaction networks, but the underlying representation in terms of a graph of chemical species and reactions quickly becomes intractable to analyze as the complexity of the network grows. Network or graph models are often used to represent macroscopic dynamics over processes whose microscopic dynamics do not occur on practical temporal or spatial scales. Chemical reaction networks follow this pattern and represent first principles traversal of a high dimensions potential energy surface. Methods such as DFT can capture these paths, but cannot scale to useful macroscopic dimensions. Moreover, common graph or network representation of chemical reactions does not faithfully represent common higher-order or n-ary relationships. The approach described in this proposal uses approximations of these first principles to provide a fine enough selection method to find high quality paths from higher-order generalizations of graphs known as hypergraphs and thereby reduce overall DFT evaluation. The methods we use are built on novel geometric and topological tools which find mathematical meaningful global structures in practically applicable to chemical reaction data for Li-ion batteries and solid-state chemistry. The initial effort will focus on the extraction, representation, and analysis of Li-Ion Battery Electrolyte (LIBE) dataset. This dataset contains complete data related to the reaction chemistry present at the Surface Electrode Interphase (SEI). Our core objective is to provide principled exploration of large and applicable complex chemical reaction networks and thereby reduce the number of validation cycles by DFT. This is divided into three tasks: 1. Develop ETL software pipelines to build novel data representations of chemical reaction networks; 2. Develop computational reaction synthesis tools from topological data analysis and spectral theory for these novel data representations; 3. Demonstrate these new tools and showcase flexibility of data representation in the context of SEI chemical reactions. The new representation and methods can be compared to existing work on the same dataset which use a kinetic Monte Carlo inspired search over graphs. The phase I project will focus on chemical reaction networks related to the synthesis of lithium ion battery electrodes (inorganic chemistry) and chemical degradation processes of electrolytes in lithium ion batteries (organic chemistry). This has a direct commercial application to the development of improved lithium ion batteries for transportation and electronics, in alignment with the goals of the 2022 CHIPS and Science act. If successful, our approach can be applied to many other problems involving chemical reaction networks in Phase II, such as the development of new extreme-UV photoresists for the manufacture of next-generation microchips and “one-pot” chemical synthesis reactions that reduce the time, cost, and environmental impact of pharmaceutical synthesis and biopolymers.",  ,,,,Jay  Hineman,,(919) 670-0808,jay.hineman@geomdata.com,,  ,

CUPID (CUORE Upgrade with Particle Identification) is a ton-scale 0?ßß experiment, including researchers from more than 30 institutions in 7 countries. CUPID will use molybdenum-100 containing scintillating bolometers as both the source and detector of 0?ßß events. The proposed SBIR program will further the partnership between RMD and MIT, working with the CUPID Collaboration. In our previous DOE-funded project, RMD developed the crystal growth and processing methods for lithium molybdate (LMO) scintillating bolometers of size and background-purity required for CUPID. The LMO crystals produced to date at RMD have utilized natural molybdenum, but the eventual crystals needed for CUPID will be enriched in 100Mo. Challenges in using enriched 100Mo for LMO scintillating bolometers include purification and reclamation. Suitable purity is needed for low-radioactivity background and strong scintillation signal. Reclamation of 100Mo from the residuals of crystal growth is required because of the significant expense and scarcity of enriched molybdenum. Thus, the goals of the proposed SBIR program are to develop chemical processes to reclaim molybdenum trioxide (100MoO3) from the LMO residuals and to purify the 100MoO3, making it suitable for subsequent LMO crystal growth. The efficacy of the developed chemical processes will be verified by growth and testing of LMO crystals needed for the CUPID experiment. The LMO crystals grown with purified MoO3 will be evaluated by chemical analysis and by cryogenic testing of the scintillating bolometers. Initial Phase-I work will use natural molybdenum. In the Phase-II project, we will scale-up and apply it to enriched 100MoO3 in sufficient volume to produce LMO crystals needed for CUPID.",  ,,,,Joshua  Tower,,(617) 668-6822,jtower@rmdinc.com,,  ,

General statement of how this problem is being addressed: We plan to construct an initial numerical model and a high-speed and accurate ML-assisted computational prediction model of physical phenomenon (gas concentration spread and changes) and economic analysis under various environmental factors, (2) verify the developed algorithm with small-scale (&lt;1 acre) controlled experiments (&gt;100 repetitions) utilizing the previously-developed sensor network, and (3) develop a user interface app with a merge of an economical prediction model.What is to be done in Phase 1: During the phase 1, this STTR proposal aims to develop a computational model with a machine learning algorithm to enable the unmanned identification of near-real-time localization of weed/herbivore attacks in biofuel crops (sorghum) yield with minimal numbers of distributed sensors. Specifically, the aimed computational model will convolute several parameters through a machine learning model over a farming season for accurate prediction of the crop damage points including the location, timing and orders in hexanal detection within the sensor network, wind speed and direction, temperature, and humidity data in order to maximize the accuracy with minimal numbers of distributed sensors. It will further refine its interface with individual farmers by establishing user-friendly alerting and field status reporting. More importantly, the computation model integrated with the ultra-low power sensor network will also provide economical gain status monitoring by considering the status of reduced labors, farming supplies and equipment maintenance. Previously, our team developed and demonstrated innovative near-zero-power and thus long-term deployable gas (hexanal) sensors in completely off-grid sorghum fields in Nebraska, enabling the first continuous monitoring of gas emission from the field without the needs for battery replacements. The key enabling technology was to make the gas sensors normally-dormant (thus nearly zero-power) but continuously monitoring. It subsequently demonstrated unmanned and near-real-time detection of the released hexanal from stressed sorghums utilizing the wirelessly-tethered network of distributed gas sensors in the actual sorghum field. This preliminary validation was performed in multiple sorghum fields in Nebraska and Puerto Rico, previously sponsored by the ARPA-E OPEN 2018 project. Building on top of these previous demonstration, this proposal plans to seek to develop a computational algorithm that enables the accuracy in pin-pointing (localizing) the location of stressed sorghums for rapid treatment by farmers, and optimizes the number of deployed sensors for economically sound solutions for actual sorghum farming. We believe that this development of such a computational model and the utilization of the developed low power sensor network will provide a key step toward autonomous smart farming and the paradigm shift in scouting crops, ultimately leading to significant enhancement in the production of biofuels as well as in the reduction of pesticides and costs significantly.This integrated system will lead ultimately enabling localized treatment, instead of over-spraying chemicals everywhere, recovering the current crop loss of 10~30% total biofuel crop production. This will help reduce the overall crop production cost by 10~30%. It will help the farming cost reduced, the biofuel crops and farm soils be much healthier due to lower dose of chemicals, and thus higher biofuel production efficiencies. Additionally, recovering the sorghum production loss due to this development will contribute to the sequestration of greenhouse gases (GHG) and improvement of fuel efficiency.",  ,,,,Seungbeom  Noh,,(801) 927-0215,moses.noh@utah.edu,University of Utah,Seungbeom  Noh,

However, Fourier’s law will become invalid at micro/nano-scale, which can cause a large discrepancy in the thermal and electrical performance between the simulation results and the actual application. To improve the current state-of-the-art, a new semiconductor device simulation software that adopts the advanced phonon frequency-dependent Monte Carlo simulation technique to replace the conventional Fourier’s law for the thermal transport modeling is proposed. Monte Carlo simulations track the phonon movement and scattering so that the thermal properties of the nanomaterial can be extracted stochastically. The simulation accuracy will be improved because the proposed Monte-Carlo-based software can incorporate detailed phonon transport physics. The Monte Carlo simulation will be coupled with Charon and Trilinos software packages, which are funded by the Department of Energy and its Office of Advanced Scientific Computing and Research, form a complete semiconductor device simulation software. In Phase I, the coupling between the frequency-dependent phonon Monte Carlo code, Charon, and Trilinos will be performed. Simple one- and two-dimensional test cases will be performed to calibrate the software. In addition, a basic user interface and a material database will be created to improve the user-friendliness of Trilinos and Charon.

The method has provided unique information about the dynamics of soft heterogeneous materials, including confirmation of the de Gennes model of polymer reptation and quantitative measurement of bending constants of biologically relevant lipid membranes. However, scientists continue to clamor for even higher resolution than NSE can provide. Biomaterials, polymers, glasses, and artificially nanostructured materials all manifest slow molecular motions because of weak or competing interactions between subunits and are amenable to study with neutrons, provided sufficiently long dynamical correlation times can be achieved. All these materials have important applications to advanced technologies so understanding them is key to technological progress. General statement of how this problem is being addressed: We will address the need for high-resolution neutron spectroscopy by using a technique called Neutron Resonance Spin Echo (NRSE). While similar to NSE in many respects, this method has the potential to exceed the NSE capabilities, if 2 technical hurdles can be overcome. The major impediments to successful high-resolution NRSE are the availability of two technologies: a very high frequency, efficient, radiofrequency (rf) flipper for neutrons and a method to correct certain magnetic aberrations. Based on previous STTR support and follow-on research we have developed a suitable rf flipper and we have invented a method to correct the magnetic aberrations. Both technologies need refinement to make them suitable for implementation at a neutron source such as the Oak Ridge National Laboratory nuclear reactor. In this proposal we seek to perfect the two technologies and to combine them into a single, operationally convenient device. Commercial Applications and Other Benefits: In view of the increasing demand for the unique scientific information that high resolution neutron spectroscopy can provide, we expect several major instrumentation upgrades at both U.S. and foreign neutron centers will require make use of the NRSE method over the coming decade, creating a market for the devices we will design.

During Phase I, a new and innovative Urban Hydrology Measurement Sensing Suite (UHMSS) will be developed with the capablity of improving the spatial characterization of urban flow by measuring parameters such as depth, flow, and temperature and wirelessly transmitting the data for real-time monitoring. UHMSS will enable highly-detailed and low-latency hydrologic information gathering by developing a robust, low-power, low-cost sensing suite which can be deployed as a distributed network across heterogeneous environments.

We need to improve the purity of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) generated oxygen &gt;98%. It is well-known that current PSA system oxygen concentration is limited to 95%. Currently used PSA system with zeolite adsorbent can be improved. The microstructure of the adsorbent surface affects oxygen purity. Our improvement on PSA oxygen generator is mainly based on energy recovery, optimized bed adsorbent design and treatment process. Our work includes characterizing the adsorption capacity, adsorption force and adsorption speed of the adsorbent for nitrogen gases variation with the pressure. When the adsorbent bed is depressurized, these adsorbent components will be desorbed, regenerating the adsorbent. These processes are completed on our re-designed multi-layer adsorbents bed to maximize oxygen production and to accelerate adsorbents recovery. We augment the separation operations by designing the optimal treatment process including automated control of adsorption, desorption, flushing, other processes to improve oxygen purity and productivity.

In order to expand the accessibility of this great DOE resource, this project focuses on incorporating MFEM into an existing software product, enabling scientists and engineers without computational programming expertise the opportunity to leverage MFEM in a user-friendly capacity. Overall, this combination of technologies will make HPC-enabled simulations more accessible to non-expert users and democratize EM and multi-physics simulation capability all while increasing addressable problem size through HPC use.

As much as three quarters of this material is single use, and only a small proportion is currently recycled. In 2018, 36 million tons of plastic waste were generated in the United States and 24 percent of that waste was recycled or incinerated. The remaining material was either sent to landfills or escaped into the environment. The Department of Energy recognizes the significance of this environmental problem and is seeking innovative research to develop a solution. Southeastern Biochemicals recognizes this opportunity to capture plastic waste before it reaches the landfills and the environment and profitably upcycle it into biochemicals. Their approach is to use a fermentation technology in which plastic wastes are heated to convert them into an oil. This oil is then consumed by microorganisms that convert it into biochemicals. Previous work at Southeastern Biochemicals has demonstrated the proof-of-concept of the process to convert polypropylene into biochemicals in Y. lipolytica, however the product yields were lower than necessary for economic viability. The objective of this project is to apply the principles of genome engineering and microbiome science to leverage metabolically engineered organisms to significantly improve the yield of biochemicals in our process. In this project, we will focus on the upcycling of polypropylene, which is the third largest volume of plastic produced today but has one of the lowest recycle rates. We will assess and engineer two oleaginous yeasts, Y. lipolytica and R. toruloides, to produce fatty acids and fatty alcohols, which are ingredients in many consumer products including detergents, surfactants, and paint.

Improving the efficiency of the converter target will allow these projects to proceed without in-house development and translates into lower operating costs and the ability to operate with higher beam currents. By focusing on the total particle shower after the converter, not just positrons, we will reduce the irradiation of nearby accelerator components, minimizing the activation and degradation of those components. This means that one does not have to wait for the radioactivity to decay to access the accelerator vault for maintenance, an important consideration for high energy facilities operating around the clock. During this project, an effective positron converter centered around a free surface GaInSn liquid metal jet will be designed. Free surface liquid metal jets allow for significantly greater electron beam power densities than possible with solid targets. Higher power densities lead to greater positron production and importantly, allow CW operation.

This intermittent process of alternating injection/production in each well is repeated many times. The hot water/steam that is produced by the well cluster via this process will feed an on-site portable small-scale (0.5-1 MW) geothermal power plant. While one well of the cluster is undergoing injection, its neighbor will be undergoing production, thereby providing continuous feed for the power plant, which will in turn provide continuous renewable power. Multiple well clusters can simultaneously be served with multiple power plants using this process. This geothermal project is unique in that it merely recycles already-existing shale wells that sit dormant, instead of drilling new wells which all other geothermal projects do. This project produces no oil or gas and addresses the creation of Enhanced Geothermal Systems in a selected sedimentary area with large temperature-gradients, which is of particular interest to DOE. The Haynesville shale area (TX &amp; LA) has over 10,000 wells with over 1,000 already shut-in, many of them with temperatures in excess of 390?F. However, rather than containing adequately large amounts of native hot water to act as its own hydrothermal resource, the reservoir’s heat must be “mined” using cold water that is injected from the surface, is consequently heated by the rock at the bottom of the wellbore, then flows back to the surface. Moreover, accessing these geothermal resources requires a complex well- completion strategy designed such that the injected water contacts a large surface area of rockface for efficient heat conduction, while still providing a hydraulically conductive subsurface pathway both for the injected cold water to enter the formation, and for the heated water to flow back to the surface. To enable a quick and economical start of the geothermal power generation project, we take advantage of the following current conditions: 1) these shale reservoirs have thousands of wells already drilled and currently inactive, that can be used for geothermal projects, and can quickly be accessed at low cost; 2) these shale wells have already undergone expensive completion programs connecting them to a large fracture network with intimate connection to the rock volume in the reservoir; and 3) modern technology for geothermal power plants includes small portable units, each of which can be used aggressively for a few years to serve one small cluster of wells, and then moved to the next cluster of wells. The principals of Renascent Energy Management LLC, and Ivan E. Terez (PI) &amp; Kenneth R. Kibodeaux, will conduct the research in the company’s office. Ramsgate Engineering Inc. will be engaged as a consultancy to help evaluate downhole tubing/packer changes, and fluid lift design. The overall market opportunity is quite substantial as a large portion of the current 10,000+ Haynesville shale wells are already depleted and have approached their economic limit after only 4-6 years of production, and many of their bottomhole temperatures are above 390?F. Furthermore, there are other shale basins that exhibit similar high temperatures. Thus, conversions of these numerous older shut-in wells may become quite a viable option for generating electricity. Estimated electricity production will be about 1 GW with the modular development and using 1,000 wells, which is a low-side estimate of the already shut-in wells in the Haynesville field.",  ,,,,Ivan  Terez,,(713) 855-2466,i.terez@renascentenergy.us,,  ,

Gamma- and X-ray imaging and spectroscopy instruments are frequently utilized to detect, localize, and characterize nuclear materials, photons, or particles of light. These detector systems include a large number of simultaneously working detector elements. The challenge is to properly address the need of large channel count, high-precision and high-speed data acquisition (DAQ) system for such a densely populated detector system. Pacific Microchip Corp. proposes to develop a 256-channel data acquisition (DAQ) system based on a 32-channel 12-bit 0.5GS/s ADC ASIC developed under the DoE SBIR award DE-SC0017213. This ADC ASIC also includes a PLL clock synthesizer to generate a low-jitter sampling clock on-chip (a single reference clock is used for channel synchronization of the proposed DAQ system), a JESD204B standard compliant high-speed data interface, an I2C interface for programming configuration registers and precision low-noise biasing circuits. Eight ADC ASICs are required for 256 acquisition channels. A commercial Virtex Ultrascale FPGA will receive data from two ADC ASICs – a total of 64 data lanes each running at 8Gb/s. The FPGAs will also implement custom digital signal processing (DSP) and high-speed data transmitting. A QSFP+ transceiver is used to transform the electrical 4x10Gb/s data from FPGAs to the optical mode and transmit it through a single optical fiber at aggregate 40Gbps. In Phase I, we will provide the proof of implementation feasibility for a 256-channel DAQ system based on the Pacific Microchip Corp.’s 32-channel ADC ASIC. Phase II project will result in the improved performance ADC device and a fabricated and tested complete 256-channel data acquisition system. According to the latest market study released by MarketsandMarkets, the data acquisition market is projected to reach USD 2.3 billion by 2026 from USD 1.7 billion in 2021, at a CAGR of 5.5%. Examples of commercial applications for the proposed DAQ system include imaging systems for airport security, border/customs control, industrial radiography for non-destructive defect detection, radiography in medicine. Currently, there is no DAQ system able to perform 256-channel data acquisition with 12-bit 500MS/s ADC per channel followed by commercial FPGAs for digital signal processing. The status of market lead in providing the DAQ system for detector signal processing will contribute to the success of our product.",  ,,,,Reza  Ramezani,,(310) 683-2628,reza@pacificmicrochip.com,,  ,

Tires on electric cars wear out 20% faster on average because of increased torque and weight, so the impact of tire pollution will grow in significance as electric vehicles continue to grow in popularity. Simulation tools used for other aspects of tire and automotive design cannot accurately predict tread wear because intricate tread patterns are too computationally expensive to model with traditional hexahedral and tetrahedral elements used for finite element analysis. In this Phase I SBIR, the company will apply its patent-pending isogeometric analysis ap- proach to predict tire tread wear. In this approach, the time-intensive meshing and defeaturing approximation steps are eliminated. Instead, the computer-aided design model that will be used for manufacturing is used directly in the simulation, immersed in a smooth spline computation domain. The company will partner with a leading rubber fatigue calculation provider to ensure accurate application of its technology to this domain. The ASCR-funded MFEM library will be used to accelerate the compute of locally adaptive regions of the computation domain. In Phase I, the company will enhance MFEM to be able to compute on adapted isogeometric bases, and will integrate this to its isogeometric analysis solver. Industry-specific functionality will be added to the isogeometric analysis solver. A proof of concept workflow will be completed, demonstrating a tire-tread simulation directly on a fully detailed computer-aided design tire model. The proposed workflow is also applicable to the development and simulation of entire non- pneumatic (airless) tires, which feature similar geometric complexity as tire tread. Non-pneumatic tires that don’t go flat may be critical to the broad utilization of autonomous vehicles. Additionally, this technology will be applicable to other industries, including aerospace, defense, automotive, and nuclear energy, that have shown interest in the time-saving, accurate isogeometric analysis approach to finite element analysis.",  ,,,,Mitchell  Hortin,,(801) 717-2296,mitch@coreform.com,,  ,

In the emerging fields of quantum computing and spintronics, chiral phenomena such as electron spin can be exploited leading to advances in data storage and transfer efficiency, cryptography, computational biology and drug design, and many other technologies. Despite these promising applications, time resolved circular dichroism spectroscopy remains challenging due to weak signals and polarization sensitivity of dispersive and reflective optics. Furthermore, circular dichroism is often measured by time averaging left- and right- polarized components separately leading to integrated optical and electronic noise. Liquid crystal polymer based cycloidal diffractive waveplates (CDW) make feasible high efficiency, broadband diffraction gratings. The optical function of the gratings is obtained by spatially modulating the optical axis orientation, so-called geometrical phase modulation. The waveplate nature of the grating provides spatially separated spectral distributions of left and right circularly polarized light. Instead of using a Pockels cell or photo-elastic modulator to change the polarization across multiple probe pulses in a transient circular dichroism spectrometer, a CDW provides instantaneous and simultaneous formation of spatially separated spectral distributions of the left and right circularly polarized components such that real-time circular dichroism measurements become possible within a single pump-probe shot. This eliminates errors in transient circular dichroism spectra due to variations in probe power from shot to shot and does not limit the shot frequency to the speed of a Pockels cell. In the proposed effort, a high-speed circular dichroism spectrometer will be designed as an addon option to a commercial pump-probe ultrafast spectrometer. High efficiency, broadband CDWs will be designed to maximize contrast between the left and right circularly polarized diffraction orders for both the visible and NIR bands.

Furthermore, the slow nature of data acquisition limits their use to materials that are robust under the electron beam. With the advancement of direct electron detectors, several functional materials that are electron beam sensitive such as perovskites, metal organic frameworks and lithium ion battery materials can now be studied in 3D by electron tomography. However, the current methods use the microscope’s goniometer to tilt the sample, which limits the speed of data acquisition and also has a limit in its tilt range, resulting in artifacts in the reconstruction due to the presence of a “missing wedge”.Proposal of Solution: In our preliminary work, we have developed a prototype that uses a DC motor with a fine gearhead that rotates the sample as opposed to the conventional approach in which the rod is rotated by the goniometer. In this proposal, we propose to extend our aforementioned preliminary efforts in electron tomography by achieving the following:Improved tomography holder with higher concentricity: Using advanced manufacturing techniques, we will build a holder that provides better concentricity and provide sample rotation using a built-in piezo motor. Add in situ capabilities. This will allow use of chips or MEMS devices that are typically used for in situ TEM experiments. To take advantage of the 360 degree rotation we will also prototype a continuous rotation tomography holder with a built-in heater that will heat a sample installed on a tungsten needle. Develop a control system: A feedback control system will be developed connecting the holder, detector and the microscope’s stage using Python that will allow users to perform in situ tomography experiments from a single program.Plan: For the first phase of the project, we would i) develop and prototype two versions of in situ continuous rotation tomography holders: a) holder compatible with currently available MEMS devices and b) holder with a heating attachment and tungsten needle. ii) develop a feedback control system that keeps the sample at eucentric height and in the field of view at all tilt angles with minimum radiation damage. iii) demonstrate a heating experiment using the prototype at NCEM, Berkeley Lab.Commercial Applications: Electron tomography holder with in situ capabilities can be used to understand failure mechanisms in various materials of interest in energy harvesting and storage applications.",  ,,,,Alpesh  Shukla,,(510) 439-7225,akshukla@zonexus.com,,  ,

Collecting well logs are often passive and associated with additional costs. In addition, many logging packages cannot sustain high-temperature formations often observed in geothermal conditions. In these conditions, surface and downhole drilling data such as weight-on-bit (WOB), rpm, torque, vibration, and cuttings can be leveraged for real-time prediction of petrophysical properties. In addition, at the rig site, drill cuttings are commonly monitored and examined by mud loggers, mud engineers, pore pressure specialists, and other on-site personnel. These samples provide a direct source of information about the formation and help to answer specific questions that well logs data cannot explain during formation evaluation. Predicting permeability and porosity from these data while drilling will also overcome many challenges, reducing the cost of coring, increasing the time value of its utility while drilling, characterizing subsurface physical and chemical changes, and assisting in real-time decision-making. The primary objective of phase 1 work is to leverage drilling data and cuttings using a novel physics-informed machine learning workflow. The workflow combines physics-based simulation, laboratory experiments, and an advanced data-driven approach for estimating petrophysical properties. This proposal is also leveraged by access to cores and cutting samples collected from geothermal well sites available at academic partner institutions. Available data in GDR (Geothermal Data Repository) can be leveraged for developing a robust workflow. Greenpath systems, with the help of academic partner, will have access to unique resources such as geothermal wells core and drill cuttings and high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) laboratory set-ups to perform the laboratory experiments.

The goal of the project is to develop a stand-alone resonator system that is accurate, precise and robust, and therefore can be used as the basis for a laboratory instrument as well as an on-line process monitoring sensor. Molten salt systems are highly relevant to liquid fuel media and heat transfer fluids in advanced power generation and storage systems. Measurement and monitoring of the density and viscosity of molten salts is a critical yet unmet need for the engineering and operation of advanced nuclear reactors as well as concentrated solar power systems. Viscosity and density sensors for nuclear power applications must also be resistant to ionizing radiation, and our proposed design enables addressing this challenge. The proposed system excites a multi-lump cylindrical resonator at a frequency near the resonance frequency. The change in oscillation amplitude and phase when the resonator is immersed in the medium is measured, and for viscous materials such as molten salts, these parameters can be used to extract the viscosity and density of the surrounding medium at known temperature. Measurements made using a torsional resonator system are advantageous due to the small form factor and absence of motors or moving parts. Thus, the system may be configured for use as an in- line monitoring sensor with the electronics distanced from the sensor, in addition to being used as a sensitive laboratory instrument. Building upon research that was previously used to measure the viscoelastic properties of fluids at low temperature, we will design and demonstrate a minimum viable prototype of a robust, accurate torsional resonator viscosity and density measurement system. A commercially available high temperature viscometer and crucible will be used to control the temperature for the Phase I MVP development, which will allow us to focus efforts on the design and implementation of the resonator and signal processing.

While carbon emissions associated with electricity production have reduced significantly over the past decade due to a precipitous decline in solar, wind, and battery costs, several sectors including chemicals and industrial transportation remain hard- to-abate. Specifically, by shifting chemical and fuel production away from fossil-based high-temperature processes towards the use of renewable feedstocks and electricity (i.e., “electrifying” the industry), we can substantially reduce carbon emissions from this sector. However, the electrochemical production of chemicals and fuels from renewable feedstocks is still an emerging industry, and for many processes is not economically viable. To deploy numerous electrochemical processes at the rate at which the climate crisis demands, a new approach is needed for the design, discovery, and optimization of novel electrocatalysts and systems. Here we propose a conceptually new approach for uncovering the operating configuration of active sites on the surface of catalysts based on our proprietary ultrahigh-throughput experimental characterization of catalysts, computational modeling, and multi-modal machine learning. We will invert the existing paradigm – which uses a simulation of a material’s structure to predict its function – and instead start with catalyst’s functional data and reconstruct the surface structure of a catalyst from a pool of possible unit cells. This approach eliminates the need for prohibitively slow and expensive experimental structural analysis, enabling us to rapidly discover novel catalyst materials optimized to device architecture and electrochemical environment. Ultimately, the proposed technology will result in dramatically accelerated development and deployment of novel electrochemical processes that address the climate crisis. In Phase I, we will focus on electrocatalytic activity as the main function input complemented by density functional theory modeling and optical microscopy for nanoparticles within a combinatorial 3-element design space. We will explore systems with well-understood phase diagrams and simple-pathway reactions – such as oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions utilized in fuel cells – to demonstrate the potential of this approach. Electrocatalytic activity data will be collected using Stoicheia’s proprietary high-throughput synthesis and screening technology, which will be complemented by computational modeling and artificial intelligence. In Phase I, we will demonstrate that large-scale, high-quality functional data in combination with computational modeling can be utilized to build a multi-modal artificial intelligence framework for accurately predicting structural characteristics of electrocatalysts. The development of better electrocatalysts is critical for achieving a sustainable future, and at a fundamental level, deep understanding of the ways in which molecules interact with catalyst materials will enable the efficient design of electrochemical systems for accelerated time to market. The proposed work enables novel electrocatalysts to be discovered at a significantly faster pace, higher accuracy, and drastically reduced compute power – without the burden of characterizing each material’s structure – representing a paradigm shift in the way new materials are designed and commercialized. Indeed, this foundational understanding will have significant economic impact. For instance, high-performance, earth-abundant catalysts for oxygen reduction in fuel cells, oxygen evolution in water-splitting electrolyzers, and electroreduction of CO2 will provide significant climate benefits as well as unlock hundreds of billions of dollars of value. The proposed work will empower Stoicheia to effect significant improvements broadly across electrochemistry, each of which will bring the global chemical and energy industries closer to decarbonization.

Consequently, the past decade has seen significant improvements in the detector technology including the Mixed Mode Pixel Array Detector (MM-PAD), DECTRIS’s PILATUS, and TIMEPIX from MEDIPIX collaboration. All these detector platforms currently rely on the use of a Silicon, or a relatively thin CdTe semiconductor bump bonded to their respective readout platform. Although the use of CdTe extends the energy range of these detectors, further increase in energy performance is highly desirable. To address this issue, RMD proposes to develop an x-ray imaging platform based on TlBr semiconductor converter layer that can be directly deposited on a readout sensor using economical vapor deposition process. We plan to use the Timepix chip as the readout sensor for this purpose. With its extraordinarily high stopping power arising from its high effective atomic number (ZTl=81, ZBr = 35) and high density (7.6 gm/cm3), high resistivity, and excellent charge transport properties, particularly in thin layers, TlBr is extremely attractive for high resolution X-ray imaging even for energies well above 100 KeV. Low melting temperature of TlBr (480 &#176;C) permits its thermal vapor deposition directly onto readout chips, thereby eliminating the need for bump bonding. Recently we have demonstrated efficacy of this approach which makes it worthy of pursuing from the technology development and commercialization perspective. The Phase I effort develops the design concept and the film deposition process and characterizes candidate TlBr films to demonstrate stability at operating bias with suitable electrode materials. The results of the Phase-I effort will be the design concept, the film deposition process as a flow chart, samples of films and the electrical and x-ray detector characterization of the films. The electrical characterization of the films includes measurements of the resistivity and the current voltage curves, and the radiological and stability characterization includes the measurement of x-rays in single pixels. TlBr films will be deposited on several Timepix chips and the resulting imaging x-ray detectors will be characterized. The Phase-II effort will further optimize the deposition process, deposit films on Timepix chips, characterize the imaging performance, and develop a readout platform suitable for structural biology applications at synchrotron facilities. Thus, the outcome of the proposed Phase I/Phase II program will be an advanced hard X-ray detector with high sensitivity for energies ranging from 8 keV to 100 keV and above that can operate at high global count rates with wide dynamic range, single photon sensitivity and high spatial and energy resolution. Commercial potential of such a detector is high and RMD will pursue that path. The proposed X-ray camera design will find use in virtually any situation where high-resolution X-ray imaging is desired or needed. A potential commercial application includes of dental radiography where high spatial resolution and contrast are required. An example is the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of electronic circuitry, where feature sizes in integrated circuit interconnects (e.g., solder balls) can be on the order of only a few microns.",  ,,,,James  Christian,,(617) 668-6897,jchristian@rmdinc.com,,  ,

In order to predict how these watersheds will behave under current and future weather dynamics (e.g. if , how and where flooding would occur due to intense rainfall), we need dense measurements of river stage and river velocity. Current instruments are too expensive to deploy in the quantities needed to provide these dense measurements. A novel low-cost, non contact, autonomous sensor (and associated software) is being developed which can automatically measure river stage and river velocity. The sensor will automatically send data on river stage and velocity to a cloud based server from where the data will be accessible to end users in near real time. In Phase I we will develop our sensor and the associated software and test and validate it. Validation will be done by deploying thirty sensors to an urban watershed and co locating these sensors with existing commercial instrumentation for measuring river stage and velocity. This system will allow state, city and federal agencies to get the required high spatial density data that they need to accurately model urban watersheds at an affordable price point.

Fluorescent light for image contrast is also the basis of most optical “super-resolution” techniques that achieve far-field spatial resolution beyond the classical limit. However, non-invasive imaging techniques have been developed that use only native fluorophores, or bypass fluorescence in favor of other forms of inherent (endogenous) contrast. Molecular identification can be done endogenously by probingthe Raman spectrum, although this is a weak process and requires coherent methods to enhance the signal using pulsed lasers. To date, non-fluorescent super-resolution imaging methods that target coherent nonlinear processes such as coherent Raman spectroscopy and harmonic generation have been exceedingly rare and demonstrated limited effectiveness. We will build an imaging system for examining endogenous contrast mechanisms in biological samples, with chemical specificity, achieving super-resolution for all contrast mechanisms including coherent Raman scattering. We will employ a novel use of an imaging scheme known as multiphoton spatial- frequency modulated imaging. In Phase I, we will build the microscope and characterize its imaging performance. Performance will be measured with test targets and compared to numerical models. We will demonstrate resolution-enhanced biological imaging of endogenous fluorophores, coherent Raman signals, and harmonic generation signals. We plan to target structures that are relevant to metabolic processes with applications toward biofuel generation. Our proposed instrument will provide a valuable tool enabling biological research to proceed with enhanced spatial resolution for a variety of contrast mechanisms beyond fluorescence. Our technology can be added as a bolt-on module to the front end of existing multiphoton microscopes, or be built as a stand-alone instrument. The technology is relatively insensitive to wavelength, and can be used toprovide enhanced resolution of nonlinear signals from the UV to the mid-infrared. Other application spaces for our instrument include materials science, advanced manufacturing, biomedical research, and homeland security.",  ,,,,Keith  Wernsing,,(505) 216-5015,kwernsing@mesaphotonics.com,,  ,

In one machine, suspect items, devices and supplies can be chemically sterilized to a high degree of confidence in a process that is so rapid as to be practical and easy. The Phase I completed prototype successfully achieved 0% recoverable bacterial spores in 10 minutes (greater than 6-log reduction) when those spores were located on the distal (furthest) portion of the internal instrument channel of a simulated surgical scope. The technical challenges in delivering the Topic's desired specifications and performance were achieved for Phase I. Further refinements are planned in Phase II work plans including optimized design and treatment cycles as well as all safety and regulatory and GLP studies which will be included in the final FDA 510(k) clearance application. PURioLABS believes the PURitALL Desktop can be field-ready within 24 months. According to the CDC: In the United States, approximately 46.5 million surgical procedures including approximately 5 million gastrointestinal endoscopies—are performed each year. Each procedure involves contact by a medical device or surgical instrument with a patient’s sterile tissue or mucous membranes. A major risk of all such procedures is the introduction of pathogens that can lead to infection. Of the approximately two million American patients who acquire an HAI (Healthcare Associated Infection) annually, an estimated 90,000 will die. The average cost of a single case is over $25,000, with the direct cost of HAIs to hospitals estimated at between $28 billion and $45 billion annually. For the warfighter and the supporting forward medical units, lower infection risk equals higher average readiness. For the battlefield and civilian opportunities to lower infection rates, the PURitALL Desktop features an innovative, fast, eco-friendly multi-modal antimicrobial technology that is applied to the exterior surfaces and interior channels of medical devices and supplies. The original core technology has proven efficacy via independent laboratories, is recently deployed as a mobile cabinet in hospital pilots and is acknowledged by leading U.S. epidemiologists as very promising. Our Phase I PURitALL Desktop has further advanced the core technology to provide mobile and rugged sterilization capability with nominal power requirements, a lighter construction, flexible interior space for a variety of devices while not leaving behind harsh chemicals, solid waste or environmental impact.

that support neurorecovery and mitigate risk for secondary conditions. Our published clinical research
suggests that acute cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL-6 levels are associated with outcome after severe TBI, and
these temporal IL-6 profiles over the first week identified potential sub-acute and chronic peripheral inflammatory
markers, including IL-6, that associate with long-term functional outcome. Our published work shows that higher
serum sIL-6R during the first 3 months post-injury are associated with worse overall cognitive performance
assessed 6- and 12- months post-injury, yet higher ratios of sgp130/sIL-6R are associated with better cognitive
testing performance indicating a potential protective effect of sgp130 against sIL-6R associated “trans-signaling”.
Depression is also linked to sIL-6R levels, and our clinical data show a moderating effect of sIL-6R on global
outcomes wherein high sIL-6R signaling loads favor a detrimental IL-6 “trans-signaling” environment that we
propose facilitates CNS damage, while low sIL-6R loads favor beneficial classical signaling that we propose
supports neurorecovery. These clinical data suggest that sIL-6R is a modifiable target in the post-acute
rehabilitation phase of TBI recovery for which sgp130 may be a viable treatment that improves outcome.
These clinical research findings are complemented by in vivo studies using the controlled cortical impact injury
(CCI) model of TBI in mice and rats showing sgp130-Fc bioconjugates can reduce cognitive deficits, CNS pro-
inflammatory signaling, and histological damage associated with CCI. However, various mutations and
conjugations of sgp130-Fc, including anti-transferrin receptor (anti-mTfR Oligo) sgp130-Fc bioconjugates, may
facilitate blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration and reduce CNS sIL-6R trans-signaling after TBI. Thus, this SBIR
will focus on proof-of-concept in vitro studies to develop and assess novel sgp130-Fc bioconjugates, with IgG1
mAbs as isotype controls (Phase I), and develop novel anti-TfR Oligo/sgp130-Fc bioconjugates and assess their
effects in vivo using the CCI mouse model of TBI (Phase II). We will select lead bioconjugate candidates by
testing 1° and 2° endpoints for efficacy following treatment in male and female mice after severe CCI. These
include PK assays, microglial activation/uptake, sIL-6R trans-signaling blockade, and treatment efficacy.
Treatment efficacy will be assessed by examining reduced serum/CNS load of pro-inflammatory and CNS
biomarkers, brain tissue sparing, normalization of cellular immunity, and improvements in neurobehavioral
assessments. This work will support future studies developing viable human sgp130-Fc bioconjugates for
clinical, rehabilitation phase treatment after moderate to severe TBI.",  ,,,,WILLIAM E HASKINS,,(210) 563-4492,will@gryphonbio.com,,  ,

VCP modulates the human and rodent complement system. During the past two decades, we have studied VCP extensively in a number of preclinical inflammatory disease models including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and spinal cord injury (SCI) and demonstrated that controlling complement mediated inflammation by VCP has significantly improved outcomes, leading to our hypothesis that VCP can be potentially used for therapeutic treatments of these diseases. AD is one of the most devastating diseases amongst the aging population in the world and the 6th leading cause of death in the US. It is well known that amyloid proteins and plaques are associated with activation of several proinflammatory mediators, especially complement components. Interestingly, ApoE genotypes that significantly facilitate A- deposit, are strongly involved in regulation of classical complement cascade. These pro-inflammatory mediators can cause damage on their own as well as working in synergy with each other, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration. Over time, the damaging role of complement components overpowers their beneficial effects as the disease progresses. As a result, complement pathways have become potential targets for developing treatments of diseases such as AD. To provide a proof of concept, we investigated the role of complement pathways regulated by VCP in AD mice model. In this model, VCP was shown to be effective in preventing memory loss. To further develop VCP as a potential treatment for AD, in this SBIR phase I study, we will aim at characterizing high qualify humanized recombinant VCP (hrVCP) and at the assessment of candidate hrVCP in animal models in a more clinical relevant manner by an independent CRO company with two specific aims: 1) To subject hrVCP to a full battery of in-house analytical characterization and stability profiling; ; Specific Aim 2: To validate our previous findings by testing efficacy of hrVCP in APP/PS1 AD models with collaboration of an independent CRO laboratory. Our milestone goals include development of active and stable hrVCP pre-formulation in Saline, production of more hrVCP if resources allow, and validation of efficacy data in AD models from a laboratory other than our own. If we are successful, PK/safety assessments and other preclinical studies of purified hrVCP protein will be the goal of Phase II studies, along with even more rigorous safety studies including in vitro cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and bone marrow toxicity studies in stem cells derived tissue cells. We expect that the SBIR phase1 studies will lead to development of hrVCP for a commercial scale therapeutic approach to target the progression of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration anticipated in AD patients.",  ,,,,JIANHUA  ZHOU,,6179534160,jianyi1966@hotmail.com,,  ,

The development of genetic medicines such as gene and cell therapies like Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)
T cells has necessitated new technologies that can monitor the biodistribution of these therapies in human
patients. Imaging is particularly well suited to provide such quantitative measurements of a genetic medicine
over time. Vellum Biosciences is a platform imaging company geared to fill this void in technology, providing
repeatable, robust, sensitive measures of a genetic medicine in situ with clear applications in new drug
development, clinical research, and eventually clinical practice. Vellum’s technology is based on positron
emission tomography (PET) radiotracer derivatives of the synthetic antibiotic trimethoprim (TMP) and its protein
target dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). When DHFR is expressed in a genetically delivered medicine (e.g.
mRNA, lentiviral or adenoviral vectors), TMP radiotracers can be used to measure the expression of the protein
products in any tissue within the body. This strategy has been used to monitor the trafficking of CAR T cells
targeting several solid tumors in animals. In this STTR phase 1, we propose the development of a commercially
viable radiosynthetic route for broad, widespread distribution of TMP radiotracers. In AIM1, we will develop a
two-step radiosynthetic process which shall decrease the need for HPLC purification and co-develop a single
vessel synthesis which will be applicable to many commercial radiosynthesis modules. In AIM2, we focus on a
cartridge-based, solid-phase workup of the radiochemical products. Taken together these short-term goals
provide both the feasibility and tractability for commercial radiopharmacy production of TMP radiotracers. More
broadly, imaging is expected to be particularly important in the coming decades to validate and prioritize new
genetic medicine therapies. We have already formed relationships with global pharmaceutical companies to use
these technologies and envision that these approaches are critical to the advancement of next-generation
medicines for the continued improvement of human health.",  ,,,,MARK A SELLMYER,,(617) 543-6546,mark.sellmyer@uphs.upenn.edu,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,  ,

treatment. This cost is on an upward trajectory. We have less understanding of the impact of falls and risk in
the Spanish-speaking Hispanic/Latino population. Although a variety of community-based public health
programs are addressing fall prevention, these programs are in English and are not effectively translated and
delivered to culturally diverse communities. The Hispanic American population age 65 and over was 4 million
in 2016 and is projected to grow to 19.9 million by 2060 or 21% of that total age group. Elderly Hispanics in this
specific population frequently fall and are worried about falling. Exercise programs can reduce fall risk for older
adults by improving muscle strength, balance, and gait instabilities. Fall prevention programs are encouraged
by the CDC, NIA, and many other organizations, and are often provided by community-based organizations
and other institutions. Barriers to offering Spanish speaking exercise programs include difficulty in finding
qualified instructors who speak Spanish and many age 60 and over are typically unaware of proper exercise
regimens. KINIMA Seniors in Spanish aims to reduce fall risk in the Hispanic population through the use of its
novel mobile assistive technology for fall prevention. KINIMA Inc., is a women-owned company incorporated in
2016 and incubated in both University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton Venture Initiative Program and Stanford
University’s StartX and commercially offered. KINIMA Seniors in Spanish is a ground-breaking, novel
technology that uses computer vision with no on-body sensors, an innovative side-by-side view through
augmented reality guidance with proprietary content, body joint tracking and artificial intelligence, plus multiple
forms of feedback to provide a digital 2-way comprehensive fall prevention exercise platform. The proposed
Phase I study seeks to determine the KINIMA Seniors in Spanish mobile phone motion tracking platform’s
feasibility, acceptability, and accuracy to support fall prevention in Hispanic/Latino settings. To that end, project
AIMS are: 1) Evaluate KINIMA Seniors in Spanish acceptability, engagement and capability for subjects to
complete sessions with little or no intervention by human staff; 2) determine specific forms of content and
features that best promote the desired physical movement among the targeted populations; and 3) determine
the effectiveness of the KINIMA Seniors in Spanish technology for automated tracking of participant
movement. The KINIMA automated assessments will be compared against tracking by a human, which is the
approach taken by most clinicians today to assess fall risk. These AIMS support the mission and research
priorities of reducing falls and fall risk among Spanish-speaking seniors. This Phase I study is a major
milestone and allows the project study group to assess user acceptability of the features and effectiveness of
the automated measures. Phase II will determine the efficacy of the platform in improving fall risk outcomes

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on advancing a bin packing algorithm to minimize void space in outbound shipping containers. The 3-Dimentional Bin Packing Problem (3D-BPP) is a classic Nonlinear Programming (NP)-hard problem that has been studied for decades. To solve the problem, an effective and easy-to-implement constrained, quantum accelerated, deep reinforcement learning model is being developed. Monte Carlo Tree Search is an unsupervised, heuristic search algorithm technique in which the learning agent learns to predict the expected value of a variable occurring at the end of a sequence of states. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) extends this technique by allowing the learned state-values to guide actions which subsequently change the environment state. A proof-of-concept assessment showed that the learned strategy meaningfully outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Outcome success metrics for this project are greater than90% utilization rate, sub 24 hours of model training time, and greater than2500 parcels/hour for any given data set.

Caveolin-1 is a promising therapeutic target in fibrotic diseases. The profibrotic effects of caveolin-1 deficiency in cells and in mouse models is suppressed by a peptide equivalent to its active site (caveolin-1 scaffolding domain, CSD). We have shown the beneficial effects of CSD in two independent models of PO-induced cardiac disease [transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and angiotensin II (AngII) infusion] and also in aged mice. In all these models, CSD almost completely suppressed pathological alterations in ventricular function, fibrosis, and microvascular leakage. However, CSD lacks suitable pharmacologic properties for drug development. To address this issue, we developed novel, modified versions of CSD. We first divided CSD into three subregions (amino acids 82- 89, 88-95, 94-101) and found they all suppressed fibrotic disease in vivo. To improve their pharmacology, we modified CSD and each subregion to be water soluble and protected from proteolysis. This modification also enhanced their uptake by cells and increased their ability to inhibit several purified kinases in vitro. So far, we have only had the opportunity to test the modified, water-soluble version of 82-89 (W82-89) in an HF model. W82-89 would be an excellent Lead Compound based on its effects on cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and microvascular leakage. However, because of the distinct pharmacological properties of our four modified peptides, it is quite possible that another peptide is more effective than W82-89. Thus, to select a Lead Compound, we will perform a side-by-side comparison of the four candidates. We will then determine the Therapeutic Index (ratio between toxic and beneficial doses) of the Lead Compound. Specifically, we will: 1) Select a Lead Compound using two model systems: AngII- and Isoproterenol-Induced HF. AngII and isoproter- enol infusion are two frequently used, mechanistically distinct, model systems for inducing HF in mice. Studies will be performed both in a prophylactic and in a therapeutic format (i.e. treatment begins only after disease is established). We will consider these studies to be a success if a Lead Compound is selected that suppresses the pathological effects of AngII and isoproterenol on ventricular function (Ejection Fraction [EF], fractional shortening [FS], isovolumic relaxation time [IVRT]) and cardiac hypertrophy [heart weight/body weight ratio] by >50% and the effects on fibrosis and microvascular leakage by >75%. 2) Determine the Therapeutic Index of the Lead Compound. The dose-dependence of the Lead Compound’s beneficial effects will be determined using doses above and below our current standard dose. Its toxicity will be evaluated in a Single-Treatment Maximum Tolerated Dose Experiment using 1X, 5X, 25X, and 125X our current standard dose. We will consider these studies to be a success if the Therapeutic Index is >50. In summary, these studies will provide a novel Lead Compound that meets our Criteria for Success, both in terms of suppression of HF and of safety.",  ,,,,STANLEY R HOFFMAN,,8437929640,hoffmas@musc.edu,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,  ,

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project aims to develop technology to perform unconstrained sign language recognition and natural sign language production. Specifically, current methods to train language translation models are ill-equipped to handle the sign language domain due to the lack of training data within this domain. Additionally, all currently established methods (apart from motion capture, which is unscalable) for producing American Sign Language (ASL) result in stilted, unnatural signing from an avatar. This project will develop solutions to these issues within the domain of ASL via semi-supervised expert-augmented models and data augmentation techniques. Technical hurdles include the lack of models to handle high-dimensional low-resource language domains, and lack of sufficiently large datasets. Technical milestones include creating semi-supervised datasets, engineering data augmentation techniques, generating a natural signing avatar, and performing extensive usability testing.

_x000D_
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will advance knowledge in the field of spoken dialogue systems in several ways. First, the project establishes a new research area by noting that AI and spoken dialogue systems have yet to be applied to nutrition. Typically, conversational agents focus on factual question answering or tasks such as flight booking, but there is an opportunity to leverage big data for learning relationships between diet and health. Second, this project will develop a neural generative chatbot model with memory, demonstrating the benefit of personalized conversational interactions with intelligent agents that remember the history of conversations and personal details about the user. While manually writing chatbot responses ensures more control over the output, the drawback is that the responses are less interesting, diverse, and flexible. This work proposes generative Transformers in order to generate more realistic, human-like responses and knowledge graphs as a novel method for remembering the conversation and diet tracking history of each user for personalized feedback. Finally, this project proposes the application of causal inference, often used for medical diagnosis, to the new, challenging task of predicting which foods lead to outcomes such as gut symptoms, weight loss, or muscle building._x000D_

_x000D_
This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a generalizable platform that can rapidly search through vast materials spaces for higher performance electrocatalyst materials, displacing the current materials which are simply the best amongst the limited candidates tested to date. Using this project’s proprietary Megalibrary technology, which enables the rapid synthesis of libraries of tens of thousands of unique, well-defined, monodisperse, and complex metal nanoparticles in a single experiment, coupled with high-throughput screening technologies, it is possible to quickly probe hundreds of thousands of unique catalyst candidates to find electrocatalysts optimized for performance. To accomplish this goal, the project must adapt protocols to allow the synthesis of electrocatalyst Megalibraries on electrodes and enable electrocatalyst screening. Additionally, the approach requires robust and high-throughput screening methods that can site-specifically interrogate the electrocatalytic properties of the catalyst candidates. Using these two innovations, it will be possible to then demonstrate the power of the platform by searching the entirety of a three element platinium and materials (Pt-M1-M2) space for the best hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst on a per platinum-atom basis. This demonstration will solidify the ability to translate this platform to a much broader materials space and set of reactions, which can impact businesses and industries globally._x000D_

Evaluation for neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia requires a 5-part white blood cell (WBC) differential with
platelet count. Currently, instruments capable of these measurements must be operated in a CLIA-certified
laboratory and rely on complex workflows involving multiple reagents, extensive calibration and maintenance,
and operation by highly trained personnel. Turnaround times of hours or days delay administration of critical
treatments, such as chemotherapy, anti-psychotic medications, and blood transfusions. Cellia Science will
address the need for more rapid blood cell differential tests and develop a device to diagnose neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia suitable for point-of-care or low-resource settings. This device will implement label-free deep
UV imaging combined with microfluidic “blood smear” preparation and cell classification algorithms to perform
blood cell differentials. Cellia’s deep UV images are pseudo-colorized and appear similar to Giemsa-stained
images, the current gold standard for manual differentials. However, because we are directly detecting the
nucleic acids in the cells, our images are inherently quantitative nucleic acid mass maps with subcellular detail
and femtogram sensitivity. In Phase I of this project, we will develop a microfluidic sample cartridge prototype,
verify its ability to form the desired cell monolayers, and evaluate the accuracy and precision of counts
performed using the cartridge with our imaging device prototype. Blood samples will span the clinically relevant
range of hematocrit levels to verify device functionality at varying blood viscosities. Accuracy and precision of
the device will be evaluated with samples from healthy patients as well as from patients with neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia to demonstrate acceptable performance for the target patient population. Successful
development of the microfluidic sample cartridge will demonstrate the feasibility of a scalable, robust sample

Radiation exposure can be potentially lethal via the hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) and the gastrointestinal-ARS (GI-ARS). The U.S. government has committed to supporting development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) to mitigate morbidity and mortality of these radiation syndromes. Re-purposed leukemia drugs have proven useful in treatment of the H-ARS in preclinical models, but there remains no effective MCM for GI-ARS. Ceramedix, Inc. is developing a pipeline of therapeutic candidates with the goal of preventing and mitigating illness due to radiation exposure. Our lead candidate, CX-01, is an anti-ceramide single-chain variable antibody fragment (scFv) that binds ceramide on the exocellular leaflet of the plasma membrane of radiation-injured endothelial cells in the GI tract and in other organs. By binding ceramide, ceramide-rich platforms are disrupted, thereby preventing cellular death. Extensive data in multiple species, including non- human primates (NHPs), show that disrupting the ceramide signaling pathway protects and mitigates the GI- ARS. We have demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in NHPs as well as mortality benefits in mice. CX-01 may be administered subcutaneously, a critical advantage during mass casualty events. Ceramedix’ therapeutics may have broad application in multiple additional diseases. Ceramide-rich platform signaling is a ubiquitous damage response pathway that drives cell injury and death in response to diverse disease and environmental stimuli. Ceramedix has generated significant preclinical data supporting treatment of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. Ceramedix is also exploring other diseases including diabetic nephropathy and pulmonary injury (fibrosis and other pulmonary syndromes). The overall goal of this work is to validate that CX-01 demonstrates equivalent potency and efficacy as a precursor non-humanized scFv molecule. We will perform in vitro and in vivo pharmacological studies to support CX-01 IND acceptance. The ability to prevent and treat GI-ARS would have profound benefits in protecting civilians and defense personnel. There is no current treatment for GI-ARS, particularly one suitable for field administration following a mass casualty event. USG has prioritized this critical unmet medical need.

The Princeton Net Zero America study suggests that a of minimum 0.9 gigatons /year of CO2 sequestration is required to transition the country to a net-zero economy, which is 1.3 times larger than the country’s oil production on a volume-equivalent basis. One of the many substantial challenges to achieving this feat is identifying and profiling capturable CO2 streams from emitters across the United States. Software that could robustly address this challenge would provide benefits to society and the country. For example, climate change is recognized as the largest threat facing humanity and the security of the United States; Transitioning the US economy to net-zero CO2 emissions is one of the largest wealth creation opportunities of our generation. _x000D_

The proposed CO2 National Capture Opportunities and Readiness Data software will enable users to identify sources of CO2 (e.g., cement manufacturers and ethanol refineries) that could be profitably turned into carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) projects. The database would provide the break-even CO2 capture cost, technology readiness level (TRL), and lifecycle CO2 emissions of any prospective CCS project across the country by integrating the latest public data and scientific research into a single end-user platform.A novel integration of advances in multiple disciplines is required for successful project completion: 1) big data fusion, 2) CO2 capture stream characterization, 3) lifecycle assessment, 4) advanced techno-economic assessments, and 5) software engineering. Additionally, this project will also advance the status-quo by creating dynamic results that can be easily re-generated as needed (e.g., with new technologies deployed or policies enacted)._x000D_

Individual cells achieve this diversity via unique gene regulatory programs – where in, unique sets of regulatory elements (REs) precisely instruct each cell which genes to express and when. Mapping such gene regulatory programs are central to molecular biology and genomics, as mis-regulation is a major cause of disease – mapping not only helps in diagnosis but also enables therapies that can intervene and correct mis-regulation. Single cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC) has emerged as the popular mapping assay to delineate REs unique to each cell. When scATAC is performed alongside single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA), the researcher has access to both REs and gene expression, allowing them to obtain unprecedented insight into the gene regulatory programs of living cells. There is only one problem – there are often multiple REs in the neighborhood of a gene and without the ability to link specific REs to its target genes, a mechanistic view of gene regulation is lacking, limiting our ability to enable precise diagnosis and drug discovery programs. High throughput chromatin interaction capture assay and sequencing (HiC) presents a three-dimensional view of the genome, often informing the missing link between RE and their target genes. Indeed, several KOLs – e.g., Dr. Tomi Pastinen calls scATAC, scRNA and scHiC as the “trifecta of modalities” that can truly delineate gene regulatory programs of individual cells (see Dr. Pastinen’s letter and 30+ additional letters of support). Recognizing the value, several academic labs have developed scHiC protocols, which has already unraveled incredibly detailed mechanistic insights of gene regulation of complex microenvironments including breast cancer, prostate cancer, hippocampus – several of these studies are discussed in this application. Despite the enthusiasm around scHiC data, adoption has been restricted to a few labs because of (1) severe experimental inefficiencies that result in exorbitant costs (upwards of $20,000 per sample), and (2) because current scHiC protocols involve complex plate- or combinatorial indexing workflows that are challenging to setup and execute. Via a self-funded phase-1 program, we tackled problem (1) to drastically improve efficiency of scHiC and consequently, drive costs down from earlier $10 per cell, to <$2 per cell, details of which are discussed both in research and commercial plans. We then used our rigorous product development expertise to translate the resultant scHiC chemistry into kits that were extensively validated by multiple KOLs (see letters from Joe Ecker, Longzhi Tan and others). Upon validation, these KOLs have become customers using Arima’s scHiC, referred to as A-scHiC kits, in their single cell workflows instead of the inefficient former academic protocols. Webinars and conference presentations from these early adopters created a ripple in the community and in a span of few months, we have sold >1,000 reactions of A-scHiC kits to tens of academic labs (despite no marketing activity from Arima), who have embedded our kits within both the plate- and combinatorial indexing single cell workflows. The scope of phase-2 program is to tackle problem (2) to enable widespread adoption. In particular, we propose to build off the A-scHiC chemistry toward what we refer to as the sc3DGR chemistry that is performed upstream of 10X genomics (10XG) Chromium – i.e., the output of sc3DGR kit will be an input into the 10X ATAC (flavor1) or 10X Multiome (flavor2) kits, to concurrently capture scHiC and scATAC (flavor1), or, scHiC, scATAC and scRNA (flavor2), respectively. Such a chemistry will not only solve the ease to use problem (2) given its combability with the market leader 10XG, but importantly, it will enable multiomic analyses of the “trifecta” from the same individual cell concurrently, thus enabling cell perturbation, characterization and screening use-cases for precision mapping, diagnosis, and therapy. Once the sc3DGR chemistry is finalized, we translate it into robust kits, to be validated by 14 KOLs (see letters of support) across academia and pharma (AbbVie, AstraZeneca & Genentech). For Arima, the chemistry, the informatics, the easy end-to-end workflows, the overall workflow cost, the KOL-based go-to-market strategy – all play major factors in a seamless commercialization process of this leapfrog technology for delineating gene regulation programs of individual cells.",  ,,,,ANTHONY  SCHMITT,,6178429022,anthony@arimagenomics.com,,  ,

Creation of herbicides which are effective, naturally produced, scalable, and deployed using the current agronomic practices could alter the foundations of crop production in the United States and around the world. In view of the projected 8% annual increase in global food and agriculture market, shrinking areas under cultivation that lead to the need for higher productivity per acre, and increasing demand for nutritional food items, the need for sustainable alternatives to current synthetic herbicides that do not promote herbicide resistant weeds is becoming clearer. Widespread adoption of the proposed technology is expected to benefit farmers and crop producers reducing societal strain, financial burden, and environmental stress from crop losses due to herbicide resistant weeds by eliminating these weeds through an environmentally safe method, without the use of excess fuel, time, equipment, and synthetic herbicides._x000D_
_x000D_
The intellectual merit of this project is in developing a novel natural herbicide product that, when applied to herbicide resistant weeds, will cause seed or plant cell's membranes to degrade and lose integrity. Thus, the novel product is intended to work both as pre-emergent weed prevention and post-emergent weed control herbicide. The product will be an environmentally safe blend of natural plant extracts and excipients. The herbicide formulations will be sprayable onto soil or onto plant leaves and stems. The cost and time needed to initially screen herbicide rates, outcomes, and best practices typically is many years. The greenhouse screening approach takes months and provides valuable information to ensure that field trials, which are more expensive and impacted by changes in weather, are efficient in cost and outcomes. This project will initially focus on greenhouse validation of weed control of the most resistant weeds known in different geographical locations in the U.S. Dose response data for 50%-to-90% inhibition control/efficacy of herbicide resistant weeds will provide the information to develop a herbicide use label, directions for best practices, and good stewardship by using only the amount of herbicide needed for control without overuse._x000D_

In 2020, the total cost of cancer care was nearly $210 billion. Due to the nature of current cancer diagnostics, most cancers are diagnosed and treated during late-stages. This results in a large economic burden to patients, families, healthcare providers, and facilities. To advance the health and welfare of the public and reduce the nation’s healthcare burden, there is a need for cancer screening, diagnostic, and monitoring devices that are non-invasive, cost-effective, easy-to-use, and accurate. The proposed platform for the early detection of multiple types of epithelial cancers 1) addresses the lack of effective non-invasive portable screening devices; 2) provides faster, more discriminatory assessments in near real-time; 3) yields the most precise and accurate results to identify cancers earlier, when interventions are more impactful, less expensive, less invasive, and more likely to improve patient outcomes._x000D_

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to establish the feasibility of developing the first portable, programmable, single cell cytology platform for early detection of multiple types of epithelial cancers, suitable for use at the point-of-care. The proposed technology will uniquely combine microfluidics and artificial intelligence (AI) to act as a sensor and provide predictive analysis, allowing for the accurate classification of potentially cancerous tissue. The platform will support near real-time, multiparameter, single-cell cytology measurements and will provide a method for automated analysis of a plurality of key metrics. Proof of concept has been established for the application area of oral cavity cancers, with the approach demonstrating superior performance metrics compared to other diagnostics (tissue reflectance, tissue auto fluorescence, salivary testing, and cytology testing). It is the only adjunct that can distinguish between mild, moderate, and severe dysplasia. The key objectives for this project are to develop methodologies to link different clinical specimen types to the microfluidics environment, and a biomarker discovery process to identify biomarkers for different applications that are amenable to the platform.

The long-term objective of this project is to create a sensor-based monitoring technology for use by caregivers,
clinicians, and individuals living with Alzheimer’s disease or Alzheimer’s disease related dementia (AD/ADRD)
to mitigate the risk of pressure injuries related to prolonged sitting. Pressure injury prevalence is
disproportionately high in the aging AD/ADRD population due to physiological, cognitive, and mobility changes
that lead to increased sitting time and reduced awareness of risk factors. Impact on the AD/ADRD population is
devastating because it leads to pain that often is untreated, hospital stays which further reduce function,
increase likelihood of needing additional care support, and earlier death than those who do not experience a
pressure injury. This project specifically addresses external risk factors of pressure, shear, movement, and
microclimate at the sitting surface by providing feedback to the caregiver in real-time from a multi-sensing
system embedded in a seat cover. These factors can’t be readily “seen” by the caregiver and apathy may
prevent someone with AD/ADRD from seeking assistance to mitigate a problem, the feedback will increase
caregiver awareness so that they can take action before pressure injuries appear. While sensors exist to detect
moisture or fall risk, none continuously detect and display meaningful data to the caregiver about pressure,
shear, movement or microclimate factors directly between the person and their sitting surface. The goal of this
project is to engage with caregivers of individuals with AD/ADRD and stakeholders who are experts in sensor
technology, pressure injury prevention, and medical device innovation to design an acceptable, usable, and
feasible multi-sensing seat cover and associated software integration. The research design uses mixed
methods and includes the use of a survey, a series of focus groups with caregivers who have had experience
with pressure injuries in the AD/ADRD population, and usability assessments. An expert stakeholder design
review team will meet throughout the project to review user requirements from caregivers and build a
comprehensive set of design requirements. Prototype development of the multi-sensor technology will occur
throughout the project with consideration of caregiver and stakeholder requirement feedback. The resulting
proof-of-concept multi-sensing seat cover and updated user-facing software will undergo initial performance
testing for accuracy, durability, and validity. This project is based on the premise that by providing day-long
meaningful detail about the conditions directly between a person with AD/ADRD and their sitting surface,
caregivers will have access to information that currently does not exist, and they can then take appropriate
therapeutic action to mitigate risks. This system has the potential to reduce pressure injury prevalence
therapeutically through awareness, early detection, and risk mitigation.",  ,,,,ROB  WUDLICK,,(612) 916-3389,rwudlick@gmail.com,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,  ,

On earth, FESS can take over some of the applications that are required to deliver high power for a short amount of time, such as electric vehicle charging stations or hospital back-up power units.

_x000D_
_x000D_
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of integrating the proposed magnetic bearing into a carbon-fiber flywheel. The complexity of this task comes from having the three main parts of the flywheel (composite rim, metal core, and magnets) created using different manufacturing processes. The magnetic materials need to be protected as they will not withstand the high speeds of FESS. De-risking this manufacturing process is crucial in continuing the development of this technology and in scaling up. Another challenge is that the high speeds of FESS are expected to cause high gyroscopic torques during satellite maneuvers. Therefore, investigating ways to increase bearing stiffness (e.g., by changing magnet size and position, or modifying coil shape), while assessing the effect of gyroscopic torques through numerical models, will be paramount. Finally, the magnetic bearing has the distinctive feature of being able to tilt the flywheel (within its gap tolerances), without requiring an external gimbal actuator. This feature could possibly allow the technology to be used for dual purposes, and its implications will be investigated at a system level._x000D_

Sanaria’s Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ) Vaccine, composed of radiation attenuated PfSPZ administered by intravenous injection, assessed in 1740 subjects aged 5 months to 61 years in 6 countries in US, Europe and Africa, is safe and protective for 18 months in Africa, while PfSPZ-CVac (chemo-attenuated) conferred 100% protection against heterologous controlled human malaria infection for at least 12 weeks. PfSPZ are produced using aseptically reared female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. Only females ingest blood, so in the current manufacturing process, aseptic male mosquitoes are superfluous, consuming growth medium and occupy space that could otherwise be used for production of more females at no additional cost or effort. In this project we plan to make the aseptic mosquito rearing process 2-fold more efficient (reducing costs of vaccine manufacture by 10-15%) by removing male mosquitoes from the system at the embryonic stage. This will be achieved by creating a mosquito line in which males are conditionally expressing a lethal insect-specific hybrid toxin, originally produced by spiders. The lethality will be induced on a switch, using the Tetracycline-controlled gene expression system. In our specific aims we will: 1. Establish a driver line: a transgenic A. stephensi line carrying the Tet-On transactivator (rtTA). A transgenic line will be created by inserting the rtTA, under the tight control of the vasa promoter, which is expressed in the first few hours after egg laying. The construct will be inserted using piggyBac-based germline modification. In the absence of doxycycline, rtTA should not bind to the Tetracycline responsive element (TRE) and thus the lethal gene will be inactive when expression is not wanted. 2. Establish a Y-linked docking A. stephensi line. We have identified specific Y-chromosome genomic loci which can be used to target integration of the locus of X (lox) docking sites. RFP under the 3xP3 promoter, flanked by two lox sites will be introduced to the identified Y sequences using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated homology-derived repair. 3. Establish an effector line: A. stephensi carrying Y-linked spider hybrid toxin under the control of the Tetracycline Response Element (TRE). The Y-linked docking line will be used to integrate a gene cassette containing TRE, minimal promoter and the hybrid toxin via lox sites using the cre/lox recombinase-mediated cassette exchange. In this transgenic line the lethal hybrid toxin will be expressed only in male mosquitoes when both doxycycline and rtTA are available; in the absence of doxycycline and rtTA no lethality is anticipated. 4. Generate a transgenic conditional male-lethal sexing strain of A. stephensi. Females from the driver line will be crossed with males from the effector line. In the progenitor male eggs, the rtTA will bind to TRE in the presence of doxycycline, driving the expression of the toxin and induce male lethality, while in the absence of doxycycline both sexes will survive.",  ,,,,PETER F BILLINGSLEY,,2404032721,pbillingsley@sanaria.com,,  ,

To achieve precision guidance for these vehicles, improved radar guidance systems are needed to meet the accuracy and rate requirements for target detection and recognition in high-speed flight, but design and evaluation of these radar systems is complicated by the harsh operating conditions associated with hypersonic weapons. The Navy has identified a clear need for development of a computational modeling and simulation framework that specifically addresses mission-specific design challenges associated with hypersonic radar seeker subsystems. The overarching objective of the effort is development of a digital engineering-based framework integrating engineering and engagement modeling and simulation (M&S) tools for configurable evaluation of radar seekers in hypersonic environments to inform low-level design tradeoffs. In Phase I, the CFD Research team developed the Hypersonic Digital Engineering Testbed for Evaluating ConcepT Radars (HyDETECTR), a prototype digital engineering framework for capturing radar interference from the hypersonic environment through integrated engineering-level modeling and simulation tools. The team developed the digital engineering architecture and configurable radar modeling component of HyDETECTR, and demonstrated their application to resolution of radar interference for an antenna exposed to the hypersonic environment for a prescribed trajectory. Phase II will capitalize on the Phase I results and focus on extensions including; consideration of additional environmental effects to form more accurate interference models; integration with engagement-level simulation for evaluation against mission-specific criteria; integration with data analytics and design optimization tools to support design tradeoff studies; extensive technology validation; and insertion into Navy radar concept evaluation workflow.

The goal of this project is to develop a prototype sequencing platform and the associated methodology capable
of directly sequencing the mono-methylated derivatives of cytosine. Recently, LC-MS/MS methods to assess the
presence of the mono-methylated isomers of cytosine, i.e., 5-methylcytosine (m5C), 4-methylcytidine (m4C), 3-
methylcytidine (m3C), 2`-O-methylcytidine (Cm), as well as the bismethyl derivative 5-methyl-2`-O-methylcytidine
(m5Cm), have made promising discoveries that these modifications change when cells are exposed to oxidative
and inflammatory stress, micronutrient stress, and heat shock stress. Moreover, the placement and extent of
methylated cytosine RNA nucleotides is now believed to be important in neurodevelopment, appears to impact
intelligence, and changes with cancer, eczema, and metabolic disorders. However, no technology currently
exists that is capable of sequencing and quantifying these chemical marks, severely limiting the field’s
understanding and potential utilization of these modifications as biomarkers (for diagnostics, prognostics, and
therapeutic purposes, as examples). In order to enable the proposed feat, during this project, we will specifically
be developing a novel nanopore-based reader with the sensitivity to directly differentiate the mono-methylated
isomers of cytosine as well as the associated sequencing platform for semi-automated, stable, high-accuracy
sequencing measurements. We will then demonstrate and optimize the developed sequencing methodology
through various sequencing demonstrations, including sequencing and mapping the mono-methylated derivates
of cytosine across RNA from two different cell lines. Upon the completion of this project, we will have developed,
optimized, and fully demonstrated the world’s first functioning prototype sequencer capable of directly
sequencing the mono-methylated derivatives of cytosine.",  ,,,,ERIC  ERVIN,,(801) 582-0146,eervin@electronicbio.com,,  ,

Patients with severe AKI often require continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) because it enables hemodynamic stability and better volume control. Anticoagulation therapy is frequently used to keep the CRRT circuit (especially the blood filter) from clotting as many critically ill patients are prothrombotic, and/or when CRRT is commonly performed for multiple days. However, both systemic heparin and regional citrate anticoagulation therapy are associated with higher costs, increased circuit complexity, and complications. Consequently, we propose to develop an anticoagulant-free blood filter (the HemoCartridge) based on the ultra-high-flux and blood compatible silicon nanopore membrane (SNM) technology for extended extracorporeal applications. The HemoCartridge will operate clot free with little to no anticoagulation for the length of a CRRT session to eliminate the costs, complexity, and complications of administering anticoagulation therapy, reduce blood loss, reduce the cost of CRRT due to filter clotting and replacement, and reduce the risk of not delivering an adequate dialytic dose to the critically ill AKI patient. In this SBIR Phase II proposal, we will develop a clinical-scale HemoCartridge and then assess uremic toxin clearance and hemocompatibility on the bench top and in the anephric porcine model.",  ,,,,CHARLES  BLAHA,,4407243139,charlie@siliconkidney.com,,  ,

This curing process accounts for ~25-50% of the component acquisition cost, and can be greatly reduced using a novel ONA manufacturing approach developed in a collaboration between the Metis Design Corporation (MDC) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). ONA stands for Out-of-oven conductively heated Nano-porous network enhanced Accelerated cure cycle. Using ONA, autoclaves or ovens are replaced with flexible resistive CNT surface heaters, which is much more energy efficient. Nano-porous networks (NPN) are sized and dispersed appropriately to promote resin flow and consolidation through capillary pressure, and improve interlaminar toughness by locally creating a polymer nanocomposite (PNC). Accelerated curing can be achieved using the CNT heats that have low thermal mass, and the fact that there is no volume of air to heat in the ONA approach. ONA has proven to produce high-quality, void-free laminates with identical mechanical properties (and improved damage tolerance) compared with autoclave-cured laminates using existing prepreg systems. Compared to traditional autoclave curing, ONA benefits include 2-3 orders of magnitude reduction in total power consumption, 1.5-3x faster cycle-times, elimination of geometric constraints of a pressure vessel, and enabling low-cost tooling.",Jenna  Roeche,,() -,SBIR@AFWERX.AF.MIL,Seth  Kessler,,(617) 661-5616,skessler@metisdesign.com,,  ,

To train for these missions, SOF requires highly specialized and mission-contextualized training facilities and equipment where they can conduct crawl-, walk-, run-repetitions to hone their tradecraft before mission execution. For example, the skills necessary to covertly conduct reconnaissance and characterization of physical, analog, and digital security systems of a foreign installation, gain undetected entry into that installation, and then complete necessary steps to recover critical assets secured in that installation requires a pinnacle level of planning and rehearsal that is truly SOF-peculiar. Support for this type of hyperspecialized training facility, which aims to provide the most ecologically valid planning and rehearsal capabilities possible, requires: (i) dedicated tradecraft subject-matter experts; (ii) the ability to rapidly recreate all aspects of mission-critical environments (e.g., replicate the anticipated security systems that will need to be defeated); (iii) the ability to induce stress and cognitive workload akin to what trainees will experience on target; and (iv) the ability to quickly reconfigure the overall facility and minute details of a training scenario to support the effective training repetitions that yield the necessary SOF Operator readiness. There are fundamental limitations of the infrastructure and solutions that currently support this hyperspecialized training, including (i) an inability to rapidly reconfigure macro- and micro-elements of training facilities to achieve the variance in scenario repetitions needed to achieve the highest possible mission readiness; (ii) significant costs and lead times associated with acquiring specialized equipment and regionally appropriate assets needed to achieve ecological validity in training environment fidelity; (iii) an inability to create highly dynamic and adaptive training scenarios tailored to an individual's skills and performance on a per scenario basis; and (iv) an inability to repeatably stimulate multiple operator sensory channels with enough variance across scenario repetitions to effectively induce the stress that operators experience on target. Congress just passed the CHIPS act which includes instructions for the NSF to invest in XR technology because they recognize the power and cost savings of virtual training.

Historically, the limitation of situational awareness has been the availability of data. However, in today's data-saturated battlefield, the challenge has shifted to efficiently harnessing the torrent of source data to construct an accurate picture of the battlespace. For a typical Maritime Operations Center (MOC), the Common Operational Picture (COP) is the visual representation of the collective situational awareness. As the Navy develops the Maritime Tactical Command and Control (MTC2) system, the NavyÆs next generation command and control platform, it is paramount that the underlying data management and analytics can effectively leverage the deluge of multi-modal geospatial and non-geospatial data. To meet these challenges, the Machina Cognita Technologies (MCT) team (MCT, University at Buffalo, and Voyager Search) proposes to develop the Multi-modal Evidential Deduction for Upgraded Situational Awareness (MEDUSA) engine. The system will streamline the data management pipeline, leverage Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to drive accurate and targeted analytics, and create and integrate enhanced data layers and geospatial visualizations. Overall, the MEDUSA system will lead to increased situational awareness and enhanced geospatial analytics to accelerate and support kill chain requirements. The MEDUSA system will be designed to be an end-to-end data enhancement and visualization system supporting analysis for kill chain requirements. It will ingest multi-model COP source data, generate enhanced predictive data layers, and output real-time geographic visualizations to aid in threat analysis and environmental assessment. The efficiencies gained from a streamlined prediction analysis will lead to a clear and rapidly understandable operational picture providing increased situational awareness. MEDUSA will be composed of four primary components: a data correlation and entity disambiguation engine, semantic state space and entity embedding models, geospatial analytics algorithms, and an enhanced visualization tool. MEDUSA will expand and expedite the available data behind each entity displayed on the COP through an entity disambiguation step. By providing a single correlated view of the known information pertaining to each entity, MEDUSA will be able to help expedite the kill chain process. MEDUSA will then utilize semantic embedding space algorithms to encapsulate both the world state information as well as entity state information to enable analysis of the entire situation by deep learning-powered geospatial analytics algorithms. Next, MEDUSA will provide a collection of geospatial analytics algorithms to empower visualizations providing commanders with rapid, enhanced situational awareness. Finally, the MEDUSA system will provide semantically filterable and mission-specific data layers and visualizations.",Nicholas N Gizzi,APM S&T,6195532861,Nicholas.j.gizzi.civ@us.navy.mil,Jonathan  Day,,7035979686,jonathan.day@machinacognita.com,,  ,

The system will provide for local storage of recordings of 1,000 hours per radio, 5,000 hours total. For this research, ReyComm Communications System envisions building on system architecture to streamline the rapid deployment of this man-carry system and add capabilities and features through software development. ReyComm's Phase II goal is to de-risk follow-on research and accelerate system maturity by testing of full-scale prototypes and, eventually, full-scale hardware/software testing. ReyComm is concurrently expanding ReyComm Communication System capabilities to include the software capabilities mentioned above through additional R&D. This Phase II research will perform Laboratory and field testing per the direct input from the 53rd Air Traffic Control Commander to operate as described, be man-portable, and rapidly deployable, and meet the local recording ability. The three key R&D objectives of this proposal are: Objective 1. Deliver a five-frequency Air Traffic Control Sustainment System: 2 UHF, 2 VHF, one LMR, and associated antennas and masts. Objective 2. Develop “CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM” into a Primary Crash Phone System. Wirelessly link the primary location/Control Point to four nodes via party line and individual ring lines with a range of no less than one mile. Objective 3. Develop capabilities to independently record two-way audio from five ground-to-air devices and provide sufficient localized storage to record 1000 hours per unit or 5000 hours total. In addition, develop capabilities to transcribe the five independent two-way audio conversations to text. These three objectives are articulated within the Work Plan and Task Outline below, and in the MOU, with discrete timelines and acceptance criteria. The goal is to expand the functionality and further the R&D on bringing ReyComm Communication System from three independent ReyComm solutions to a deployable integrated system.

The 45 SFS has explored autonomous quadrupedal unmanned ground vehicles (Q-UGVs) to automate and augment perimeter security, free up manpower, reduce hazards to Defenders, and maintain an active security posture. Patrol environments are extremely dynamic and full of debris such as fallen trees, temporary construction, and wreckage that can disrupt the robots’ ability to autonomously navigate on predetermined pathways. Airmen must manually travel to a downed robot, troubleshoot the issue, reprogram the robot, and redeploy it. Depending on the location this can take hours and takes a Defender from their other duties. It disables a critical security monitoring asset, the robot, out of operation, blinding the base to threats and intrusions. From a command and control (C2) perspective, robot C2 is currently highly manual. Defenders are required to use handheld controllers to program and operate the robots which creates an additional manning burden that negates the robots’ intended time/manpower benefits. These challenges negate the intended benefits of the robots by creating additional inefficiencies and burdens. Because of the growing strategic importance of the Space Domain, ensuring safe and undisrupted space launch operations from PSFB/CCSFS is critical and any threat detection capabilities fielded must operate effectively.   45 SFS and the broader DAF force protection community needs an ability to plan robotic missions, execute these missions, and integrate the robotic sensors for base wide situational awareness remotely from the Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC). The 45 SFS recognizes the opportunity to use ARES Security’s AVERT Mission Planning and Operations (MPO) and the proposed RDT&E to enable security robots to autonomously improvise, adapt, and overcome obstacles encountered in the field so that security and disaster assessment missions can be accomplished. As PSFB/CCSFS, the DAF, and the broader DoD continue to embrace autonomous air, ground, and sea platforms, the need for enhanced C2 and AI-based learning will need to keep up with operational requirements from the field. This will ensure DAF/DoD bases remain defended and the DoD keeps pace with evolving technology in warfare.   AVERT MPO enables autonomous mission resiliency. The DAF approach to Resiliency is rooted in the quick recovery of mission capability when the unexpected happens. The DAF requires resiliency in their autonomous platforms and systems to maximize their performance in the field. Without resilience these autonomous platforms bog down Defenders’ time and negate any benefits the systems might bring. AVERT MPO enables a BDOC operator to remotely control the missions and operations of multiple Q-UGVs and introduces the means to overcome Q-UGV challenges without traveling to the location of the Q-UGV while on mission.",Jenna  Roeche,,() -,SBIR@AFWERX.AF.MIL,John  Halsema,,(703) 264-5671,jhalsema@aressecuritycorp.com,,  ,

The most effective way to identify a DeepFake is through audio, voice, and language queues. Native language speakers are the most effective way to identify DeepFakes. The Air Force suffers a shortage of skilled linguists in strategic threat languages - specifically Russian and Ukrainian. They can take 44 weeks for basic proficiency and 5-6 years for mastery. There are millions of sound bits and videos circulating across Publicly Available Information (PAI) sources and social media (Tik Tok, Instagram, Facebook). All of these contain synthetically manipulated DeepFake content and the number is growing exponentially. The Air Force simply does not have the numbers of native speakers or cryptologists to keep up with the flood of DeepFake content in PAI. This risks adversary DeepFake content proliferating across PAI and spreading disinformation which can reduce the speed and accuracy of Air Force tactical and operational decision-making. This ultimately weakens the Air Force’s ability to gather intelligence, formulate decisions, and execute air combat power rapidly and effectively against adversaries. The Air Force therefore has a need for a capability that rapidly detects DeepFake content across large volumes of PAI at scale, without being constrained by cryptologist and linguist skill and personnel shortages.  To address this need, 16th Air Force’s Air Force Cryptologic Office (AFCO) proposes to partner with Anonymous AI (d/b/a DeepMedia) on an SBIR Direct to Phase II (D2P2) to modify and adapt DeepID, DeepMedia’s commercial DeepFake detection and biometric analysis platform. DeepMedia will develop a customized deepfake detection platform so the AFCO can detect, attribute, and characterize DeepFake audio, video, and text footage. DeepMedia will perform non-recurring engineering (NRE) and research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E) to develop a customized algorithm set and bespoke platform that enables AFCO analysts to assess open-source intelligence (OSINT), primarily through publicly available information (PAI) sources including social media, news, and press releases for DeepFake threats. Given AFCO’s mission set, the focus will primarily be on audio, voice, and language manipulation, as defined by the end-user. The end result will be the introduction of a custom, Air Force-specific DeepFake detection tool that empowers AFCO and broader information warfare and intelligence communities with a new capability to detect audio / language / voice media manipulation, attribute its source, and determine malicious intent faster and more efficiently.",Jenna  Roeche,,() -,SBIR@AFWERX.AF.MIL,Rijul  Gupta,,(405) 765-3169,rijul@deepmedia.ai,,  ,

To combat this issue, the team at framergy and the University of Louisville (UoL) have teamed up to develop a series of battery materials that are based upon the combination of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and deep eutectic solvents (DESs). DES are known for the low vapor pressures and flammability, something that has made them materials of interest in fire resistance applications. Meanwhile, MOFs are highly porous, tunable materials that are known for their strong ability to interact with guest molecules, engendering them with high ionic conductivities.

lungs with painful, invasive treatments, and costly hospitalizations. Current treatments are not
effective enough in controlling airleaks and medical providers are seeking new therapies. There
is strong evidence that a locally delivered therapeutic via inhalation would have a major impact
on reducing the burden of this disease by promoting closure of the airleak directly. However, there
are no approved therapies to achieve the aim of quickly resolving airleaks via inhalation, and
effective treatment remains a significant unmet need.Therefore, we are developing a minimally invasive inhaled aerosol that aims to seal an
airleak quickly and efficiently in the lung to prevent painful procedures and costly hospitalizations.
The goal of this Phase I project is to develop and test the feasibility and efficacy of our novel
inhaled dry powder aerosol formulation using an in-vivo pulmonary airleak model. Successful
completion of this Phase I effort will position us to demonstrate safety in an in-vivo toxicology
study and prepare for a first-in-human clinical study. Translation of this technology into a clinically
beneficial medical product has the potential to significantly improve the lives of patients with

How do you know that a plane is friend or foe? Or that a remote device can be updated with new software, while keeping out updates from adversaries? How do you know a security badge is authentic? These functions and more are often enabled by a semiconductor circuit known as a PUF (Physical Unclonable Function) which is a digital fingerprint for chips.  This project intends to develop a new generation of chip-level secure ID capabilities with a new PUF technology. A PUF is a hardware structure with one or more unique manufacturing characteristics which can act as an immutable cryptographic root-of-trust (also known as a secure ID). Consequently, PUFs are an ideal foundation and are used in many secure applications, including supply-chain assurance/anti-counterfeiting, secure firmware updates, and trusted/secure communications - even ID badges. This project extends our previous work to build a novel hybrid quantum/classical photonics PUF. We will compare our theoretical model that was developed in Phase I against the operation of our first quantum hybrid PUF (QPUF) prototype chip. The company independently fabricated and characterized this first QPUF chip after Phase I ended. We will use the data from this analysis to drive further enhancements to this foundational technology. Recent applications of machine learning (ML) techniques have exposed flaws in current PUF designs, potentially compromising critical government and defense operational security – which can also jeopardize warfighter safety.

HGSOC has the lowest survival rates. More than 20% of HGSOCs harbor genetic mutations (e.g. BRCA1/2MUT) that cause defects in homologous recombination (HR), which causes sensitivity to PARPi. However, responses to PARPi are rarely durable and resistance is acquired rapidly. Another 50% of HGSOCs do not harbor defects in HR and instead overexpress Cyclin E (CCNE1) through amplification, copy number gain, or transcriptional means. Unlike BRCA1/BRCA2-mutant tumors, which initially respond to platinum- based chemotherapy, CCNE1-amplified tumors are associated with primary platinum failure. A recent study revealed that 1) Cyclin E (CCNE1) induction increases ATR signaling and sensitivity to WEE1 kinase inhibitor and ATR inhibitor (WEE1i-ATRi) treatment, 2) WEE1i-ATRi increases tumor regression in a CCNE1-level- dependent manner in PDXs, 3) Differential molecular effects of WEE1i and ATRi promote replication fork collapse, and 4) CCNE1 amplification is a reliable biomarker predictive of response to WEE1i-ATRi. These findings indicated that a combination of WEE1 kinase inhibitor (WEE1i) and ATR inhibitor (ATRi) is a feasible approach for the treatment of PARPi-resistant Cyclin E (CCNE1) overexpressing (CCNE1HIGH) high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). These results provide a strong rationale for Atrin to develop a first-in-class combination of WEE1i and ATRi that can allow lower-dosing strategies to mitigate off-target toxicity for the treatment of HGSOCs. Atrin Pharmaceuticals, Inc has been in the field of DDR for over a decade and is pioneering the development of next-generation, selective ATRi. We have discovered ATRN-119 as a highly selective ATRi and have received FDA IND approval (IND #141317). In parallel, we have also discovered a highly selective WEE1 inhibitor demonstrating high potency on WEE1 kinase, superior selectivity over PLK1, and significant anti-growth activity against various cancer cell lines of NCI-60 panel with high potency. In addition, our WEE1i exhibits superior potency in OVCAR8 cells compared to AZD1775. Pharmacokinetic (PK) study in mice shows superior oral bioavailability compared to AZD1775. In an OVCAR-3 xenograft tumor model, it alone completely halts tumor growth without causing loss of body weight. Importantly, our WEE1i sensitizes the ovarian cancer cell line (OVCAR8) to ATRN-119. Given these promising results, we proposed to 1) Quantify sensitivity of HGSOC to our WEE1i and ATRN-119 alone as well the combination in PDX models of HGSOC. 2) Identify additional biomarkers to expand target patient populations, 3) Evaluate the toxicity, and 4) Obtain a GMP batch of API. The success of our Direct-to-Phase II project will further support chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) to manufacture clinical supply of our novel WEE1i and complete FDA-required IND-enabling pharmacology safety and toxicology studies. In addition, findings from this project will inform clinical trial protocols using our first-in-class combination for the treatment of HGSOC, which critically needs more efficacious treatments.",  ,,,,OREN  GILAD,,2155896356,oren.gilad@aprea.com,,  ,

The PATCH system is an innovative end-to-end cyber protection framework on aeronautical data through integration of computer/network security procedures and data protection software to ensure that the integrity of the aeronautical data is maintained through all the threat surfaces along the data chain, without causing unnecessary burden on the aircrew or mission planning staff. PATCH uses procedures identified through a comprehensive white hat analysis to minimize the threat surface along the data chain. Its blockchain-based hash tree, integrated with digital signatures, ensures the integrity of aeronautical data and improves their traceability along the data flow path, which can be established through system document review. As a result, PATCH can mitigate all risks, including errant and malicious tampering, that could impact the integrity of the mission-critical aeronautical data at all stages, unlike CRC or hash codes, which can be spoofed, thereby preventing propagation of corrupted data from reaching the aircraft and compromising the mission, which directly addresses the Navy requirements. In Phase II, Intellisense plans to finalize the selection of two Navy platforms with the largest threat surface (such as the T-45 and CH-53K) based on an updated white hat analysis, develop a formal design of the PATCH system to meet platform requirements, implement PATCH algorithms and procedures, develop a formal qualification testing (FQT) plan and a FQT environment, and conduct formal qualification testing on PATCH algorithms and procedures. The FQT environment will also be used to demonstrate that PATCHÆs protection is sufficient to mitigate all risks that could compromise the integrity of aeronautical data along the data flow.",Jerod N Swinehart,TPOC,3013422966,jerod.a.swinehart.civ@us.navy.mil,Wenjian  Wang,,3103201827,wwang@intellisenseinc.com,,  ,

Heavy metals are significant environmental pollutants because they tend to persist, bioaccumulate and can result in serious adverse acute or chronic health effects after ingested or inhaled. Traditionally, trace metals are measured from human tissues or fluids (blood or urine) in centralized laboratories using complex analytical methods such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). However, in view of the intensive labor, analytical costs and long turnaround times associated with centralized laboratory analyses, there is an immediate need for a portable and inexpensive system for on-site monitoring of human exposure to heavy metals. These rapid, field measurements of human exposure in the population would greatly help epidemiology researchers to conduct their studies and also help the regulatory institutions with better determination of safety limits and prevention of diseases caused by heavy metal exposures. An important goal of this Direct to Phase II proposal is to develop a technology that meet the technical and practical needs of environmental researchers, clinicians, and epidemiologists. The ultimate goal is to deliver a reliable field prototype of a sensing instrument for the current unmet needs for rapid testing of trace amounts of metals in urine samples, and to accelerate the commercialization of this product. In this Phase IIB study, Giner will develop and demonstrate the heavy metals monitor prototype from bench-top assay platform to a field-ready instrument with a portable size, with integrated components for assay operation, electronic units and software packages for data processing and user interface. Meanwhile Giner will develop and fabricate a series of disposable microfluidic lab-on-a-chip cartridge for convenient measurements of multiple metal(s) and metal combinations from large numbers of human subjects. The various cartridge designs will allow the monitor instrument to determine the presence and concentrations of multiple metals. The overall performances of the prototype will then be evaluated thoroughly through a large scale of field testing with four renowned epidemiology collaborators, as well as a team of user experience specialists, which would improve the sensing capabilities, tool reliability and usability towards commercialization. This proposed project will achieve a critical step towards the commercial release of a heavy metal field monitor, which has the potential to become a critical tool to support environmental and public health community for developing strategies to prevent toxic metals-related diseases. Giner is teaming up with leading commercial partners which specialize in the development and commercialization of screening and diagnostic technologies.",  ,,,,AVNI A ARGUN,,7815290581,aargun@ginerinc.com,,  ,

Combat medics often provide care in no or low-light conditions, surrounded by the chaos of combat, and with the limited dexterity that accompanies bulky body armor, gloves, and heavy equipment. Far-forward medical care is also limited by available resources, which are often only what a combat medic can fit in their aid bag. Therefore, a procedure such as airway management that currently requires a high degree of skill becomes substantially more complex. The purpose of this research and development project is to significantly enhance the effectiveness of one of their most basic lifesaving airway management tools, the nasopharyngeal airway (NPA). The NPA factors prominently within Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) guidelines and within civilian acute care, however, NPAs are not universally effective in relieving airway obstruction, they are underutilized in the TCCC environment, and they are in desperate need of an innovative overhaul. The NPA, also known as the nasal trumpet (because of its flared proximal end), is designed to be inserted into the nose and into the upper airway of a patient in order to relieve breathing obstruction caused by the collapse of airway soft tissues that occurs during depressed levels of consciousness. Upper airway collapse (the airway above the vocal cords) can occur in conditions such as severe head injury, coma, stroke, severe trauma, or anesthesia. The NPA, which has remained largely unchanged since its invention in 1881, has been considered an essential part of hospital and prehospital emergency care kits since at least the 1970s. However, despite the NPA’s simplicity and its prominence within TCCC guidelines, the literature demonstrates that prehospital NPA’s appear to be underutilized within Role 1 and Role 2 levels of care. This assertion is further supported by information within TCCC Guidelines Change 17-01 which states “combat medics have been observed to perform surgical airways on a number of occasions for casualties who were unconscious from hemorrhagic shock or traumatic brain injury (TBI), but who had no direct maxillofacial injuries or documented airway problems.” This is troubling, because the failure rate for combat medic-performed cricothyroidotomy is as high as 33%. NPA’s are also not always effective in relieving airway obstruction. Based upon the known shortcomings of the existing 140-year-old NPA and contemporary knowledge gained regarding the mechanisms of upper airway collapse, we are developing a concept next-level NPA (nl-NPA) which aims to address DoD user needs by effectively opening the entire upper airway. The nl-NPA also aims to be easy to place and to minimize airway trauma during insertion.",Hugh  Connacher,,(301) 619-9804,hugh.i.connacher.civ@health.mil,Jeffery  Smith,,(210) 459-9361,jsmith@olifantmedical.com,,  ,

This results in frame-to-frame fixed pattern noise (FPN) in image data, which affects the ability to detect and classify targets. The problem becomes worse when dealing with polarization because of the image processing involved in generating the polarization images. Most of the factory correction approaches are inadequate due to the drift of pixel response over time. Mechanical correction in the field is often cumbersome, impractical, and inadequate to accommodate changing scene conditions. Scene-based nonuniformity correction (SBNUC) methods can work continuously without blocking the optical path and have no moving parts to break; however, they typically depend on the motion of the scene. To address these challenges, Charles River Analytics proposes Visual Enhancement and Non-Uniformity Elimination (VENUE) software to compensate for noise in infrared polarimetric microgrid sensors.

Knowing the defense landscape more fully will allow leadership to assess potential concerns in the system and what new technology needs there are in both hardware, software, and tacticsOptTek’s proven approach to the optimization of complex systems, which includes advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) techniques like metaheuristics, mathematical programming, neural networks, and novel spatial correlated interpolation algorithms, will help an analyst understand the design space of parameters associated with the MDS for defense against multi-threat missile raid scenarios. We will leverage our novel data fusion techniques to combine results from medium-fidelity digital simulations such as AFSIM to help guide the analyst to make efficient use of high-fidelity simulations for systems like EDISS/EDP. By sampling the study space efficiently, reporting meaningful metrics to the analyst, and accurately mapping the results of the simulations, we will extract more useful information from many, many fewer simulation runs than a manual analysis of the space would allow.

An efficient, cost-effective, automated approach is needed to generate system architecture models for legacy systems from all its disparate sources of information (e.g. specifications, spreadsheets, and automated tools). Trident proposes to develop a novel Automated System Architecture Generation (ASAG) tool that uses machine learning (ML)/artificial intelligence (AI) models to automate the development of a system architecture models, in SysML format from disparate sources, integrates SysML models together to provide traceability across a mission, and identifies the impacts of a baseline change across the models. A multilayer, time independent ML model will be used to automate the capture of dissimilarly formatted source data, normalize the data into a common format, resolve conflicts between sources, and fill in missing data to ensure a SysML-compliant model after all sources are integrated. In the Phase I, Trident performed research and analysis to design the ASAG system architecture. Leveraging experience in developing two related tool suites, Trident demonstrated the feasibility of the ASAG tool within a mature SysML analysis framework with baseline impact analysis capability. In the Phase II, Trident will develop an initial ASAG prototype tool for evaluation by MDA’s digital engineering team. The ASAG results will be evaluated against a manually developed system architecture for both accuracy and time saved. Feedback and lessons learned in Phase II will be used to develop a final ASAG prototype tool in Phase III for assimilation into MDA’s digital engineering environment.

Ultimately, the final authority on target classification and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) strategy is the sonar operator.

Existing contact-free methods to measure airborne particles have employed various light-scattering techniques to obtain particle information, however, these techniques are severely limited in their accuracy due to their reliance on assumptions about particle shape, source, and refractive index. Perhaps the most promising technique to overcome these issues is digital in-line holography (DIH) which has many advantages over traditional light-scattering techniques. In this proposal, we build on previous DIH work by the team by incorporating lasers of multiple wavelengths to obtain color holographic information for each particle, providing an additional measurement parameter based on the particle’s chromatic absorption properties. Machine learning algorithms can then be applied to the color holograms to determine particle type. In Phase I, we will perform Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) modeling to evaluate the system’s theoretical response to various biological and non-biological particle types and determine the system's optimal configuration. Simulated holograms from the DDA model runs will be used to train, test, and evaluate machine learning algorithms.

Eliciting neutralizing antibodies (nAb) against HIV will likely be required to create effective therapeutic vaccines that attenuate HIV disease progression, reduce HIV infectiousness, or even effect sustained remission in the absence of daily antiretroviral drug therapy. However, eliciting such antibodies is a challenge that can be frustrated at multiple steps in B-cell development, particularly in HIV-infected people. Of greatest relevance to this application, low-affinity germline B cells reactive to neutralizing epitopes may not successfully compete with cells binding non-neutralizing epitopes for antigen, or the amount of antigen acquired may be insufficient to stimulate Tfh cells to provide the required help. Tendel Therapies Inc. developed B-cell adjuvant technology that augments Tfh cells and is designed for use with vectored vaccines. Our preliminary data show that the adjuvant acts on both Tfh and B cells to promote uniquely intense and durable antibody responses. We propose to use these adjuvants in combination with two promising B-cell immunogens to reliably elicit tier-2 neutralizing antibodies in macaques: (i) an advanced BG505 SOSIP-like trimer designed to promote focused responses to nAb targets and minimize reactivity of non-neutralizing Env epitopes such as the V3 loop or non-neutralizing CD4 binding site sub-regions, and (ii) bacteriophage VLPs displaying the HIV fusion peptide (FP) in highly multimeric form. We hypothesize that novel Tfh-targeting adjuvants promote broader nAb responses to an advanced HIV Env immunogen via mechanisms including democratic naïve B-cell recruitment and stimulation of Tfh responses. Aim 1. Assess the intensity and durability of nAb, Tfh, and germinal center B-cell responses to an advanced HIV envelope trimer, delivered with or without Tendel adjuvants, as mRNA in lipid nanoparticles. The goals are (i) to test if Tendel adjuvants have similar potency for augmentation of antibody responses to mRNA-vectored vaccination against native-like HIV Env trimers, as previously shown for augmentation of responses against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain; and (ii) to select one regimen for evaluation in Aim 2 subsequent to fusion-peptide priming. Aim 2. Evaluate the effect of priming immunization with the HIV Env fusion peptide, FP8, on neutralization breadth achieved by Tendel adjuvants and HIV Env native-like trimers. This priming regimen is intended to provide an additional epitopic focus for nAb responses. Due to the combination of anti- FP nAbs with other nAbs provided by trimer immunization, the FP8-primed regimen should result in nAb responses of increased breadth and perhaps higher titer.",  ,,,,ELLEN E SPARGER,,5307548461,eesparger@ucdavis.edu,,  ,

These two features, a Scenario Self-Authoring Module and a Less-Than-Lethal Practice Range, will provide our DAF partners the relevant, customizable, and accessible training they need to rapidly mobilize and deploy in their unique environments. However, ALL our customers, whether Federal, State, Local, Educational (private campus safety), and Entertainment (Casinos) law enforcement/security organizations will benefit from these features. All customers using the SSVR training platform in the future will be able to customize scenarios towards their own diverse training objectives.  Furthermore, all will benefit from the Less-Than-Lethal practice range by virtual employment of their specific weapons.  This will also provide SSVR further opportunity for commercialization by expanding our Less-Than-Lethal virtual offerings. This proposal could not be more relevant or timely.  Historical events and evolving issues make it imperative that DoD and all levels of law enforcement get the absolute best training available before experiencing the stressors of likely events they will face.  The ANG’s security mission frequently calls on them to perform a wide variety of Domestic Ops (DOMOPS) involving scenarios they can’t realistically train for.  The Scenario Self-Authoring Module will not only allow very specific and relevant training through a wide variety of environments, avatars, and threat weapons but provide applicable crowds/protests/demonstrations with the ability to size and control crowd reactions. Again, this training capability is not only applicable across the DoD but to all our customers and not available anywhere else. Further, the DoD has a Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) role, with numerous other Federal Government Agencies, to support a whole of government response to acts of terrorism, attacks, or natural/manmade disasters.  The National Security Strategy of the United States of America notes that “potential adversaries are developing advanced weapons and capabilities that could threaten U.S. critical infrastructure. Adversaries may also strategically target attacks to exploit interdependencies between infrastructure sectors and magnify cascading failures between them, posing incident response challenges above and beyond those created by catastrophic natural hazards.” Training and preparation in response to these contingencies are required, for the Air National Guard, and potentially the active duty.  The mission specific focus for this SBIR is the Emergency Support Function (ESF) 13, Public Safety and Security located in the National Response Framework (NRF).",Jenna  Roeche,,() -,SBIR@AFWERX.AF.MIL,JEFFREY  JARRARD,,(413) 438-7787,jeff@streetsmartsvr.com,,  ,

Both the Space Force and Air Force require advanced pointing for imaging and targeting, laser communications, directed energy, and energy transmission systems. Existing pointing systems often account for a significant allocation of Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C). Positional systems are one of the most resource intensive functions of many applications, for example, an air or spacecraft body provides first order position, followed by a gimbal, which gives you course pointing, and finally, a fast-steering mirror gives you fine angular position. In both defense and commercial markets, there is a premium on the most current / real time knowledge of what is happening on the ground. In space, the orbit of a space imaging satellite defines what can be observed below on earth. If an area of interest is outside of the sensor’s view, it is required to redirect its orientation to an object and stop and stare. The speed at which one can point a sensor from space to ground is the key performance parameter to responsive space imaging. Light Steering Technologies, Inc. is seeking to advance its patented technology which has the potential to enable a major advancement in beam steering for space imaging applications.

However, these solutions are not readily adaptable to use in the harsh environmental conditions required by the Military and Aerospace segment, nor are they capable of the high passive loss requirements. For example, the commercially available solutions in the 850 to 940nm band (so called SWDM band) are typically rated from 0 to 70C and are manufactured using complex chip on board die placement and utilize molded plastic optics. Operation over extended temperature ranges and other environmental factors such as mechanical shock and vibration are not possible. Additionally, the receiver sensitivity is generally at -11dBm (OMA) and fiber coupled powers are in the -3dBm range. This provides a loss budget of 8dBm, of which only 2dB is allocated to passive (connector) loss. Transceivers in the traditional telecom wavelength range of 1310 to 1550nm operate on single mode optical fiber, which has shown to not be robust in the Navy operating environment. Here we propose a Wavelength Configurable Transmitter (WCT) in both the SWDM and CWDM band capable of operating in the extreme military environment; that offers an addition 7dB of passive loss budget; and that is built using traditional TO packaged lasers in a hermetic optical path. The design uses a strain relieved OM4 or OM5 fiber optic pigtail with an FC-PC connector and the optical power from the lasers is collimated through the hermetic assembly. A series of filters is used to combine the individual wavelengths and direct them to the multimode fiber output. The TO can packaged lasers are actively aligned to the lenses to maximize fiber coupled power. The TO can components will be laser welded in place and back filled with epoxy (or laser seam sealed) to complete the hermetic assembly. A flex circuit is used to connect the TO laser components to a printed circuit board containing the laser drivers and associated circuitry. VCSELs in the SWDM band with output power capable of meeting the loss budget are not commercially available, and one objective of this project is to design and fabricate these lasers. DFB lasers with sufficient coupling to multimode fiber are more commercially available and these will be utilized in the program. The target is minimum of +3dBm fiber launch power per wavelength. When coupled with the Wavelength Configurable Receiver (WCR) receiver being developed by PSI for the Navy, a 15dB total link budget is achievable. The proposed architecture offers a high degree of configurability. For example, SWDM and CWDM bands could even be mixed within the WCT. Furthermore, the WCT could be made bidirectional by mixing components from the WCR. The signaling speed of each channel can be readily customized to any rate up to 28Gbps, possibly even 28GBd, making the total data throughput 200Gbps.",Obidon N Bassinan,Electronics Engineer,3013424122,obidon.bassinan.civ@us.navy.mil,Jim  Tatum,,9723420870,jim.tatum@photonsciences.com,,  ,

This results in large amounts of information being processed, requires constant communication with staff from the airwing and multiple ship work centers, while addressing frequent mission changes before air plan execution. The proposed SBIR Phase 2 project seeks to provide workload relief to Strike Ops personnel and expedite the availability of air plans and load plans by prototyping the use of intelligent software agents capable of analyzing mission, airwing, and ship requirements. The agents take into account available ship resourcesĀto generate Air and Load Plans based on learned planning rules and user preferences.

Research state-of-the-art schedule generation algorithms based on heuristic schedule generation methods. Research intelligent agent learning capabilities using deep convolutional neural network architectures.

In space ionizing Gamma rays are produced by neutron stars, pulsars, supernova explosions, and regions surrounding black holes. Manmade gamma ray sources are isotopes used in hospitals and medical diagnostic centers, radioactive materials used in sterilization of medical devices, pharmaceuticals and packaging, high-energy physics facilities such as cyclotrons and synchrotrons, fission in nuclear reactors, and nuclear weapons. Attenuation of Gamma rays is dependent upon the incident radiation energy, the thickness, density, and atomic number of the constituent elements of the irradiated material.  Large masses of concrete, lead, depleted uranium, steel plates, other high-Z materials, and water are uses as shielding.  Other shielding materials include specially formulated glass and glass ceramics, more compliant materials such as lead wool, and polymer composite materials with embedded metals.   Weapons effects shielding is a critical anti-denial and survivability technology for performing DoD missions in the Land, Air, Sea, and Space Domains, and DoDI 3150.09, CBRN Survivability Policy provides requirements. Likewise, the Department of Energy  has Order 458.1 for Radiation Protection of the Public and the Environment, and the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission  maintains standards for nuclear reactors, nuclear materials, radioactive waste, and nuclear security.  Thus, there are numerous government and commercial applications for g-ray shielding.  DARPA therefore seeks innovation in novel materials for shielding Gamma rays at MeV to GeV energies, capable of withstanding high fluences, that can be produced inexpensively and in large quantities, and ideally with flexible form factors, specifically, shielding for 1-100 MeV energy providing 2X or greater linear attenuation coefficient. The challenge for a flexible form factor composite solution is overcoming the principle of “mass in the path”.  GT solves this problem with a proprietary moldable nanotape which provides several mechanisms for EM attenuation to supplement the mechanism of “mass in the path”.  Confirming calculations were performed using a “RadHard by Design” approach with empirical data.  GT’s objective will be to design, analyze, and test several designs. The empirical test data from Cobalt-60 testing will be used to reverse calculate the linear attenuation.  GT has defined levels of Radiation Hardness Assurance (RHA) in terms of total ionizing dose (TID) received for different exposure levels.  Expounding upon manufacturing and scaling is a further objective.

Periodontal disease (PD) is globally the most common chronic inflammatory disease in humans, which according
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) affect 47% of U.S. adults 30 years of age or older and
rt60% of those over 65 years.1 Given that the course of PD is marked by a discontinuous pattern of disease
activity and inactivity showing exacerbation and remission of tissue destruction,2-4 a critical challenge for
clinicians is not detection of clinical features of periodontal disease, but rather identification of patients who have
an elevated risk for expressing active/progressing disease. Unfortunately, current guidelines and classifications
rely exclusively on clinical and radiographic measurements to identify existing disease. While these records are
a good reflection of a patient’s past history,5, 6 they fail to provide information on the current status of active
disease or identify individuals and sites at risk for future disease.4, 5 This is because active disease involves
tissue destructive processes (biologic phenotype)6, 8, 9 that precede and subsequently trigger the resulting clinical
signs and symptoms (clinical phenotype). A host of salivary biomarkers for PD have been identified7, 10, 11 and
multiple commercial assays are currently available for use in the clinic, but most lack specificity for tissue
destruction and/or are not amenable to point-of-care (POC) real-time testing. Matrix metalloproteinase-8 is
amongst the most widely documented, abundant biomarkers in saliva, and uniquely suited to quantitatively
assess the extent and degree of tissue destruction.8, 9, 12-14 As an enzyme, it is present in both active and latent
(inactive) forms, the relative expression of which dictate the extent of tissue breakdown during active periods of
disease.8, 9 Hence, we hypothesize that the ratio of active and total MMP-8 (MMP-8Active/MMP-8Total) will constitute
a more meaningful biological measure of disease activity than total MMP-8. However, measures of disease
activity to date have not been possible due to the lack of commercially available antibodies for “active” MMP-8.
Building off our team’s success in development of Disease Activity Specific Monoclonal Antibody (DASMAB)
against MMP-8, we propose here to leverage these unique assets to develop a targeted molecular assay for
quantifying disease activity. In this Phase I proposal, we plan to develop and validate an optimized DASMAB-
based ELISA assay through the following aims: (1) identify and select the best mAb pairs (capture and detection)
for each MMP-8 form to produce ELISA kit prototypes, and (2) analytical and clinical validation of disease activity
of ELISA prototypes. Successful development and validation of the first DASMAB-based disease activity assay
will precede a clinical POC diagnostic product that will offer clinicians with not only the means to quantify the
extent and estimate the rate of disease progression in real-time, but also assess response to therapy and predict
the most likely outcome of future events. These technological innovations will allow clinicians to make more
effective outcome-driven decisions and personalize preventive strategies to improve patient care.",  ,,,,ROBERT  GELLIBOLIAN,,(818) 839-0414,robert@cellectgen.com,,  ,

It is cost prohibitive to employ today’s drones in a large quantity and single-use operations, and so a new generation of drones needs to be designed in a cost-focused approach that still meets required performance and mission objectives. Since the intent is not to recover a drone, there is a need to design and develop an expendable, low-cost, long-endurance, payload-carrying drone that is flexible enough to adapt to a variety of environments and operational scenarios.  Additionally, the launch platform needs to be scalable for deploying large numbers of drones within a time span of minutes while requiring minimal operator input, setup, and physical footprint. DYZNE Technologies conducted a Phase I trade study that involved analyzing a large trade space of both vehicle design concepts and launcher systems that could meet or exceed desired capabilities of the ILED program. DZYNE used its extensive experience in UAS engineering and development to comprehensively evaluate the complex interplay of system capability, material cost, available battery technology, manufacturing techniques, operator skill, and overall system cost. The output of this trade study was the recommended approach of a simplified tube launch design, which DZYNE is uniquely suited to perform the detailed engineering and manufacturing based on its extensive experience in developing ground-based tube-launched systems. Lessons learned from prior programs will be applied to the design, program planning, cost and schedule. Being able to apply these lessons-learned up front will allow the company to identify and reduce risk to development and test. The ILED simplified tube-launched sUAS would be an extension of the knowledge and expertise honed over years of designing tube launched systems. The proposed design would allow the aerial vehicle to be both stored and pneumatically launched from an expendable cannister and contain a number of innovative features to maximize performance while keeping system costs low. The combined storage and launch canister characteristic length and diameter were selected to maximize vehicle performance versus cost, with the minimal number of simplified folding joints for the wing and tail surfaces.

The overarching goal of this project is to develop a light-weight customizable material of high impact performance for defense applications such as armor systems. Mallinda’s vitrimer will enable the onsite part production, assembly, repair, and reshaping. The polymer design facilitates the thermally activated covalent bond exchange reaction which allows these agile manufacturability features. Multi-layer armor system is necessary for structural and ballistic protection, minimum deflection, stress transmission etc. To adapt Mallinda’s Vitrimax for this purpose, the commercial resin needs to meet the end-user defined impact performance and process parameters for efficient, cost-effective part production. Targeted properties for vitrimax such as glass transition temperature, Tg  1hr, cure time < 20 min, good fiber affinity will be achieved by adjusting various material and process parameters including the formulation, cure cycle, mixing ratio, additives content, processing temperature, and solvent content. The modified vitrimax will be employed to attain the performance matrices for the composite backing layer of a vehicle armor system. Plain weave S2 glass fiber, ballistic grade aramid fiber, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) will be used as starting reinforcements. Resin content will be optimized in the range of 15 to 40 wt.%. Areal density, water absorption, tensile strength and modulus, flexural strength and modulus, interlaminar shear strength will be the guiding parameters for the composite backing layer. For multi-hit ballistic protection, alumina particle reinforced vitrimer layer will fabricated to serve as a ceramic front layer in the system. 80 wt.% alumina in elastomeric vitrimer layer will be fabricated by compression molding at the vitrimer’s re-processable temperature. Ballistic tests will be performed on composite backing layer as well as multilayered panel using MIL-STD-662 via V50 test. The targeted V50 value for the composite backing layer is at a minimum of 760 m/s for FSP and for the hybrid layer is at a minimum of 900 m/s for API. Visual inspection of the damage, depth of penetration, muzzle velocity, projectile type, distance between the panel and the projectile hit will be investigated for a given areal density-thickness of a panel. Based on the performance, a prototype panel of optimized hybrid layers for a composite armored vehicle (CAV) will be developed. Finally, onsite ability to assembly, reshape and repair will be demonstrated. Vitrimer based material will pave the way to simple on-demand manufacturing processes for composite integral armor (CIA) system. The dynamic material will result in ease of operations and logistics for the Department of Defense (DOD) and ultimately reduce the sustainment cost.",Luke  Baldwin,,(937) 255-1503,luke.baldwin.1@us.af.mil,Philip  Taynton,,(626) 353-2098,philip@mallinda.com,,  ,

The USSF is tasked with protecting and defending US interests in space. USSF now has an even greater surveillance task for space domain awareness and control in that region, but its current capabilities and architecture are limited by technologies and an architecture designed for the legacy GEO mission. Existing ground and near-earth computing systems are not only stressed by the increased range and volume, but also by limited Earth to satellite communication options in that space and navigation challenges due to the chaotic nature of cislunar orbits. To address the challenges posed to the current architecture, the USSF is exploring trusted autonomous space-based computing systems with artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities operating in cislunar space.

These actors are constantly developing new technologies and capabilities that are a central threat to American security. The innovations in this proposal are focused on Space Mobility and Logistics, Space Domain Awareness, and Blue Sky strategic capabilities. To win the space tech development race, the United States must leverage its industrial and technological advantage, open new innovation paths, and tap into the best and brightest minds of our nation and that of our allies and partners. We can no longer afford to be constrained to a paradigm that directs specified solutions over a span of decades while our competition moves at breakneck speed, unconstrained by ethics or international norms, to bring their new capabilities to bear. USSPACECOM has outlined the need to deliver decisive space capabilities into the hands of warfighters faster and with more breadth of opportunity than our adversaries can match. In order to deliver a broad pool of capabilities to our warfighters, the DoD must have a mechanism to deliver capabilities at the speed of relevance. SpaceX’s use and strategic defense of its Starlink systems is a prime example of the industry’s ability to support military operations through rapid delivery and agile operations.  In response to the need for rapid access to commercial capabilities from the US and trusted ally innovation centers, Saber Astronautics proposes to develop the Space Application Marketplace (SAM). SAM closes the loop between the massive untapped potential in our innovation sectors and the warfighters needing rapid access to the newest innovation by creating a platform for companies to build, test, and deploy their applications to high-side networks within weeks, instead of months to years. Just as the app store on mobile devices revolutionized e-commerce and created new markets for developers across the globe, the Space Application Marketplace aims to revolutionize the way DoD entities field commercial technologies. Creating an app store on top of Space Cockpit will give game-changing capability to warfighters: Providing direct access to a broad new pool of technical capabilities, from a wide range of commercial companies; Gives warfighters the ability to give rapid and direct feedback to suppliers based on operational needs; Allows rapid acquisition and rapid improvement without requiring suppliers to wait years for new Certificate to Field processes.  Dynamic war requires dynamic change.

Unfortunately, among the 17 most commonly prescribed drugs, only 6 are highly effective for most patients, 5
have a modest effect, and 6 show little clinical effect. Worse still, unwanted illness and death from treatment of
patients with the incorrect drug or dosage causes over 275,000 unnecessary deaths annually in the United
States, making it the 3rd-leading cause of death.
Genomic screening can minimize the loss of lives by clearly defining the cause-and-effect between a patient’s
genetic sequence and their disease. Many gene sequences are known to affect a person’s response to drugs.
The FDA lists over 450 warnings or recommendations for drug use based on possible genetic variants in specific
genes. Other public databases list ~60,000 “characterized” gene variants, but their importance is often unknown.
Moreover, these variants represent a vanishingly small fraction of rt900 million known human genetic variations.
The vast number of “Variants of Uncertain Significance” (VUS) present potentially life-altering medical, ethical,
legal, and societal complications. Some cause drugs to be more or less effective in different patients. Others can
stimulate growth of cancer cells or make those cells resistant to chemotherapies.
To understand the biological impact of gene variants, Heligenics has developed the GigaAssay™ technology to
measure the functional effect of all variations within any selected gene. In contrast to similar technologies, the
GigaAssay reports the activity of each variant of the gene, with high accuracy and reproducibility.
In this proposal, we plan to improve the GigaAssay and show its feasibility for detection and analysis of gene
variants that have clinical importance. In Aim 1 we will create a battery of GigaAssay cell lines and readouts for
rapid analysis of several functional cellular activities. In Aim 2 we will demonstrate that the GigaAssay can detect
gene variants that cause resistance to an FDA-approved chemotherapy drug.
This work will directly address numerous goals of the “Illuminating the Druggable Genome” project of the NIH.
Future plans include expanding the number of GigaAssays, increasing the speed or number of genes that can
be studied, and partnering with drug developers and clinical trial managers to identify the optimal drug for each
patient, based on his or her genetic variants.",  ,,,,MARTIN  SCHILLER,,(415) 794-3403,mschiller@heligenics.com,,  ,

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the need for easier syphilis testing solutions to provide comprehensive diagnosis on-site with the patient. Syphilis diagnosis relies on two separate antibody tests, of which one requires quantifying antibody levels with a tedious laboratory procedure called Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) to confirm if the patient has an active infection. The lack of resources and personnel to conduct RPR testing on-site severely limits the ability of public health clinics to effectively diagnosis syphilis in a timely manner. This project will combine both antibody tests including quantitative RPR into an automated cartridge for rapid and complete syphilis diagnosis at the point-of-care. The research proposed in this project will develop magnetic particle-enabled assays for each antibody test and integrate the assays into a multiplexed plastic cartridge. These cartridges, combined with a portable instrument, will enable all steps required for syphilis diagnosis to be completed within minutes in an affordable and easy-to-use format._x000D_

via the following properties: 1) specific targeting to procoagulant surfaces, 2) high coagulant site binding and
blocking capacity, 3) potent and specific effects of reducing clot size by selectively blocking only highly
coagulant sites, 4) reducing bleeding risk compared with current antiplatelet standard of care, 5) immediate
onset, and 6) rapid clearance from circulation. The specific target patient cohorts include, but may not be
limited to new acute thrombosis, recurrent acute thrombosis despite standard of care, thrombosis in the setting
of high bleeding risk, and ischemic reperfusion injury/recurrent thrombosis after thrombectomy or thrombolysis,
including acute stroke and other adverse ischemic events. Care for each of these cohorts has improved
markedly in recent decades, but altogether still represents unsolved management of the critical balance of
reducing clotting risk without risks of moderate to severe clinical bleeding, or in cases of clot removal,
subsequent recurrent thrombosis. This represents a major unmet clinical need, which we are seeking to
address. Our team has developed, patented, and thoroughly tested a synthetic, highly stable unilamellar
liposome nanoparticle composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) outwardly
exposing Zn(II)−bis-dipicolylamine cyanine 3 [C22,22] (abbreviated, DPA-Cy3[22,22]; together, DPAL for DPA-
exposing liposome nanoparticles), designed and demonstrated by us to bind specifically the procoagulant
phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) on the membranes of highly activated procoagulant platelets,
extracellular vesicles, and other procoagulant PS+ cellular membranes. We seek specifically to target patient
cohorts for which antithrombotics present high risk of bleeding, or are insufficient in preventing thrombosis, as
outlined above - in each of these cases, PS exposure induced by the principal adverse event directly
propagates coagulation and ensuing coagulopathies which continue to present problems in clinical
management. DPAL represent an innovative, specific and targeted approach to preventing or reducing risk for
adverse cardiovascular events while simultaneously reducing risk of clinical bleeding compared to current
antithrombotics, via selective and potent targeting of procoagulant cellular membranes. Our strong preliminary
data demonstrate that DPA-exposing liposomes (DPAL) harbor the necessary properties to fulfill the
translational goals. We will achieve the following Phase I milestone aims: 1) prepare and characterize DPAL,
determine DPAL stability profile, and evaluate endothelial toxicity, damage and permeability; 2) optimize DPAL
dosage and determine in vivo anticoagulant efficacies in acute blockade of injury- and agonist-induced
thrombosis while maintaining hemostasis in mouse models. These essential studies will firmly set the stage for
further translational studies moving to clinical trials.",  ,,,,BRIAN D GRAY,,(610) 738-7938,briangray@mtarget.com,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,  ,

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a type of extra-nodal non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma characterized by skinlesions resulting from infiltration of malignant T lymphocytes. Mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome are thetwo most common types of CTCL. Although treatments exist, they are mainly palliative with low response anddurability of response without any cure. The objective response rate remains approximately 30% with the currenttreatment strategies for refractory or recurrent CTCL. Despite CTCL being an indolent, chronic disease in mostcases, some patients experience severe debilitating itchiness, while others have progressive disease with
extensive skin and organ involvement. There is an unmet medical need for more effective treatments withimproved response for refractory or recurrent CTCL patients. The majority of clinically diagnosed CTCL highlyexpress the surface markers CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) and/or CD25. We have generated a promisingdiphtheria toxin based CCR4-IL2 bispecific immunotoxin therapeutic candidate for targeted immunotherapyof CTCL. Our candidate drug is genetically engineered to contain both anti-human CCR4 scFv and human IL2fused to a truncated diphtheria toxin. Our candidate drug has demonstrated promising preclinical efficacy in amouse tumor model showing 106% improvement in survival (69 vs. 33.5 days) compared to an Ontak®
-likehuman IL-2 fusion toxin. Our candidate drug is expressed using a novel, advanced diphtheria toxin-resistantyeast (Pichia pastoris) expression system. Our yeast expression system overcomes expression and purificationproblems encountered with E. coli-based expressions systems to deliver high production levels and excellentpurification quality of our immunotoxin. Importantly, the surface receptors CCR4 and CD25 are also expressedon tumor-infiltrating effector T regulatory cells (Tregs) known to play a role in suppressing anti-tumor immuneresponses. Therefore, a potential follow-on indication for our candidate drug is depletion of tumor infiltratingCCR4+ or/and CD25+ Tregs to boost tumor immunotherapy for a broad spectrum of cancers. In phase I of thisapplication, we will perform pilot non-GLP toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity studies in both ratsand minipigs. In phase II, we will 1) develop a scalable standard operating procedure (SOP) for large-scale goodmanufacturing practice (GMP) production and produce enough GMP grade CCR4-IL2 bispecific immunotoxinfor phase I and II clinical trials, and 2) perform GLP toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity studies
in both rats and minipigs. Our goal is to prepare an IND-ready preclinical data package and then move thisproduct into clinical trials.",  ,,,,ZHIRUI  WANG,,(303) 724-8732,zhirui.wang@cuanschutz.edu,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,  ,

This project aims to improve upon existing global financial infrastructure by replacing it with a safe, open, accessible network powered by the proposed next-generation distributed ledger architecture. Accessing traditional financial networks is a major challenge, and often requires significant capital coupled with deep industry connections. As DLT stands today, there are still challenges for it to safely support financial applications. DLT vulnerabilities can cost users billions of dollars and is leading to the same monopolistic dynamics that are characteristic of traditional financial infrastructure. This project aims to advance the foundation of distributed ledger technology to address these issues, and deliver an accessible, safe, democratized financial infrastructure that can operate on a global scale and support the untold myriad of value-added use cases from companies that cannot sustain the high economic costs, or overcome the accessibility barriers, of traditional financial infrastructure._x000D_

This SBIR Phase I project seeks to advance distributed ledger technology to safely support financial primitives. Transaction information in modern distributed ledgers is public during origination, allowing validators to exploit this information and at times their privileged position to attack every financial primitive. As an example, there are issues with validators taking arbitrage opportunities and sequencing their own transactions first. Financial best practices are to silo transactions into distinct lifecycle stages to ensure consumer safety. This solution brings these best practices to DLT through a cryptographic commitment scheme. Cryptographic commitment schemes allow users to commit to an action without disclosing sensitive details, however, the traditional process requires centralization to coordinate the timing for disclosure. The primary research goal and objective for this Phase I project is proving the viability of a decentralized commitment scheme with real world latency and no centralized timekeeping or coordination mechanism. The proposed architecture will allow users to initiate transactions without including sensitive transaction details at origination. Without sensitive transaction details, validators can no longer exploit this information for their own gain, allowing this architecture to provide the security and privacy necessary for improved safety for financial applications._x000D_

This project targets high-traffic venues (HTVs) with controlled waste streams such as stadiums, universities, airports, and theme parks. Waste stream sorting to differentiate classes of materials for recycling and landfill is currently undertaken either using rudimentary, labor-intensive manual sorting, or expensive and technically complex robotic sorting, neither of which are feasible options for small- to mid-sized facilities (i.e., HTVs), which then shoulder heightened rates imposed by material recovery facilities due to contamination. These expenses have discouraged recycling, contributing to the mounting waste problem. This project seeks to develop an intelligent waste-sorting system that leverages computer vision and innovative hardware to enable on-site, decentralized sorting, facilitating the recapture of the 66 million tons and $200 billion worth of recyclable materials that currently go to waste each year. By mitigating waste accumulation in landfills and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with virgin resource mining, this technology supports United Nations sustainable development goals 11 (sustainable cities and communities) and 12 (responsible consumption and production) and aligns with the NSF’s mission of advancing national health, prosperity, and welfare. _x000D_

The proposed technology consists of a hardware-software solution that uses the latest in computer vision to perform automated singulation (i.e., arranging objects in a 1-by-1 stream) and classification in cluttered environments, allowing for increasingly complex (or diverse) structures (shapes, sizes, and materials) to be accurately identified and subsequently sorted. This approach produces an ordered stream of objects, which can then be sorted according to any diversion scheme for efficient recycling. The software uses semi-supervised learning to allow for domain adaptation from a centralized training set, enabling rapid implementation of optimized sorting schemes of site-specific waste streams, requiring significantly less human intervention than traditionally needed. Successful development would result in a simplified sorting platform that is cheaper, more robust, and less resource intensive than existing waste sorting operations, thus offering a novel turnkey solution that could be feasibly adopted on-site.Research objectives include: 1) Developing and evaluating hardware assemblies using electromechanical processes for waste stream singulation; 2) Developing software for efficient dataset generation and waste stream classification, particularly using semi-supervised learning and data augmentation approaches; and 3) Validating the developed system for high precision singulation and classification of recyclables under noisy like conditions._x000D_

The game-changing innovation in the 2P-ActivityScope is the ability to perform unparalleled (i) optical imaging of neuronal activity in populations of neurons at subcellular spatial resolution and temporal resolution in the millisecond range both in vivo and in vitro using a variety of fluorescent indicators (e.g. voltage, [neurotransmitter]) as well as (ii) high-resolution volumetric calcium imaging of columns of cortical neurons at 40 Hz in vivo. These capabilities are crucial for ultimately decoding how information is represented and processed by the billions of densely interconnected neurons comprising the mammalian central nervous system. Neither contemporary 2-photon microscopes, functional magnetic resonance imaging, inserting electrodes into the brain, or fiber photometry can serve this need. This project will disseminate and improve upon the original, lab-built SLAP2 invention to create a commercial product for this important new technology. Based on pilot work performed at Janelia, it is clear that the 2P-ActivityScope will make a significant impact on the field of neuroscience research, including advancing studies focused on alterations in CNS circuitry associated with neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Ultimately, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for a wide spectrum of complex brain diseases. In Phase I we will demonstrate feasibility of this novel technology by developing prototype hardware and software; work in Phase II will focus on creating the full functionality of the 2P-ActivityScope for commercial release.

Over 4,400 genetic diseases have been identified; nearly all of which are considered rare, which limits the amount of research each receives. Gene therapy is an attractive approach for treatment of genetic disease because of its broad applicability. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing systems (CRISPR) have revolutionized gene therapy research and other fields of life science, however, no CRISPR-based treatments have reached the market and clinical application still faces important challenges. In this project, we aim to develop design automation software to help improve how genetic donor templates are packaged for genomic integration via CRISPR, thereby increasing CRISPR editing efficiency. Whereas such templates are usually delivered as unstructured (linear) single-stranded DNA, recent studies indicate genome integration efficiency is significantly improved when templates are folded into compact shapes using techniques from DNA nanotechnology. Such nanostructured genetic payloads (NGPs) for CRISPR have the potential to become an essential component of genetic therapy and personalized medicine. The long-term goal of the project is to provide researchers with software for designing more effective CRISPR treatments to improve the lives of people with genetic health problems. Our solution will also advance other application domains where DNA nanotechnology is being employed, such as nanomedicine, nanosensing and biocompatible nanomaterials, thereby supporting the mission of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS): improving the effectiveness of computational approaches in biomedical research. Academic software exists to facilitate design of DNA nanostructures, however, these applications either require extensive expertise or are limited to 3D wireframe designs. Design of a novel DNA nanostructure of modest complexity that is not among a small set of simple designs can require hundreds of hours of expert labor. Moreover, because NGPs are new to science, no software currently exists to automatically generate DNA nanostructures for a given set of NGP design parameters. In Aim 1 of this project, we will employ an iterative design-build-test development cycle we have used to bring other software products to market to develop novel parametric design software (PDS) able to create NGPs automatically for a given genetic template and set of design parameters. In Aim 2, we will simulate and synthesize eight NGPs and characterize them via molecular modeling and atomic force microscopy to confirm they meet design specifications. We will then test these NGPs for CRISPR editing efficiency against unstructured payload controls in vitro. In Phase II, we will enhance the PDS and use it to explore the vast space of NGP designs for those that optimize CRISPR performance via combinatorial testing across multiple cell lines, templates and insertion targets.

This is especially true for urban and/or battlespace settings where the aerosol composition can include inorganic, organic, and biological particles with complex morphologies across a range of sizes that spans orders of magnitude (1-100 μm). Because aerosols contain a large majority of innocuous particles, the detection of potential threat materials is limited by their small concentration within a complex ambient matrix containing materials of non-interest as well as interfering compounds. Moreover, aerosol properties can evolve in time through chemical aging processes and mechanical forces. While sensor technology has improved over the last 20 years, threat detection still remains a challenge in operational environments at mission-speed due to the complex and dynamic nature of the surrounding environmental media. To address the critical need, Lynntech is collaborating with Texas A&M University to develop a portable system for rapid onsite detection and morphological classification of aerosol particles based on optical light scattering, holographic imaging, and machine learning algorithms. The contact-free design eliminates the need for consumables, lowering lifetime operating costs and freeing the device from the supply chain. The optical system’s unique arrangement of light source and detectors provide additional data to the machine learning algorithms for improved identification and classification.

The cellular pathophysiology that underlies diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes,
begins to change long before disease symptoms become apparent. Moreover, current imaging techniques
typically only visualize morphology and structure. Therefore, imaging techniques that can characterize metabolic
changes have the potential to detect disease processes long before disease symptoms are pronounced.
Metabolic and functional imaging thus allows much earlier diagnosis and treatment. In vivo metabolic imaging,
which distinguishes changes in the chemical reactions that make up cellular processes, can be used to better
understand the mechanisms underlying disease onset and progression. Current metabolic imaging techniques,
such as PET and SPECT, are expensive, difficult, and not conducive for longitudinal studies due to the use of
radioactive contrast agents. Therefore, the broad clinical utilization of these techniques is limited in scope. In
preclinical models, other techniques, such as tissue slicing of sacrificed animals for mass spectrometry analysis,
need to be employed to study cellular metabolism, resulting in a very large translational gap between preclinical
animal models and clinical studies. Vizma Life Sciences has developed a novel easy-to-operate tool to prepare
contrast agents that enable noninvasive, cost-saving, and repeatable in vivo preclinical imaging and is amenable
to clinical translation. The tool prepares hyperpolarized metabolites that can be used as injectable contrast
agents visible to conventional MRI systems. The hyperpolarized metabolites, such as [1-13C]-pyruvate, have
signal-boosted spins and can be tracked in real time and report on metabolic transformations and pathways.
Vizma’s tool can be easily adapted for broad use in animal facilities and in longitudinal studies in the same
animals, thus reducing experimental variability and the number of animals required as the animals do not need
to be sacrificed for metabolic imaging. This tool will directly improve the translation of animal research to clinical
validation. The overall goal of this Phase I SBIR is to make the Vizma hyperpolarization process fully
biocompatible. This involves adapting the [1-13C]-pyruvate hyperpolarization process from an alcohol-based
solution to an aqueous solution, determining sensitivity limits, and then measuring residual solvent and catalyst
contamination. The in vivo feasibility and safety of the technology will be examined by assessing the levels of
detection of acute injections of the aqueous solution with chemical shift imaging in animals and monitoring
another set of animals receiving hyperpolarized injections of the aqueous solution once a week for two weeks.
Successful completion of this Phase I SBIR will result in in vivo proof-of-concept and support Phase II

This technology uses machine learning to automate costly aspects of advanced building control, and eliminating complexity, frustration, and expense for leanly staffed building owners who are attempting to save money, meet code, reduce carbon footprint and adapt to rapidly changing energy prices. The proposed approach significantly reduces the setup time, the amount of training data, and the compute time needed for the technology to converge on accurate models and predictions using building thermal dynamics. These improvements reduce the controller costs without sacrificing accuracy. This technology will simplify the setup and implementation process for under-represented segments in the building automation, efficiency and model-based controls market starting with K-12 schools. This simplification has several distinct societal and environmental benefits including: increased energy and demand charge savings, increased energy efficiency, improved environmental footprint, increased job creation for building controls technicians, improved resiliency, and additional educational opportunities for K-12 families and communities._x000D_

This SBIR Phase I project develops a technology capable of building efficiency control.The innovation employs a hybrid approach based on constrained deep learning tools that build on physical knowledge of building systems and architecture, thereby making use of sampling data while producing physics-consistent accuracy in modeling and control predictions. Specifically, the project team hopes to converge on an architecture that can more reliably and accurately manage energy use and occupant comfort compared to state of the art control approaches. The project team also aims to demonstrate a significant reduction in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC)-driven peak system demand in target buildings while keeping instrumentation, labor, and data costs per building to an affordable cost for the target market._x000D_

mechanical ventilation, longer lengths of stay, and long-term disability. Delirium is associated with over 12 times
increased odds of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). In addition, delirium
accelerates cognitive decline in AD/ADRD patients. Likewise, patients with underlying dementia are 2.5-4.7 times
more likely to develop delirium. AD/ADRD patients who develop delirium have a marked increase in adverse
outcomes including rate of cognitive decline, institutionalization, and death following an episode of delirium
compared to those without pre-existing AD/ADRD. The ABCDEF (A2F) Bundle has the best success at
decreasing ICU delirium among pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. The A2F Bundle is a group
of evidence-based assessments and interventions (i.e., Assess, prevent, and manage pain, Both spontaneous
awakening and breathing trials, Choice of analgesia and sedation, Delirium: assess, prevent, and manage, Early
mobility and exercise, and Family engagement and empowerment) designed to improve ICU patient care
regardless of illness pathology. Family engagement, an A2F bundle component independently associated with
reduced ICU delirium prevalence, was implemented in 63% of ICUs pre-pandemic and dropped to under 20%
during the pandemic. As the pandemic resolves, there is a gradual return to normal visitation policies, but, overall,
families remain under engaged. Interventions that expand family engagement have the potential to significantly
improve short- and long-term patient (e.g., AD/ADRD, disability) and family outcomes. VoiceLove LLC is
developing a novel HIPAA-compliant mobile application that enables expanded family engagement by mitigating
multifactorial barriers known to influence A2F bundle implementation. The VoiceLove app is a safe and time-
efficient tool allowing direct communication between patients and their family members, and between care
providers and absent family members, allowing more time for direct patient care. A pilot study with ICU patients
at New York-Presbyterian Hospital demonstrated thousands of direct family messages exchanged without any
additional nursing burden. In this Fast-Track STTR, we will refine the VoiceLove prototype and evaluate the new
application among mechanically ventilated adult patients admitted to a medical, surgical, or coronary ICU. Phase
I will optimize the VoiceLove app for ICU patients, families, and providers. Phase II will include a randomized
control trial (RCT) comparing VoiceLove implementation to usual care control to investigate the effect on
optimizing patient-family-provider communication, engagement, and ICU delirium prevalence. Mitigating ICU
delirium is of paramount importance to reducing the risk of long-term complications, including an increased risk
of developing AD/ADRD as well as accelerating decline in patients with AD/ADRD. This Fast-Track STTR
represents a major step forward in bringing a novel technology to the bedside to expand family engagement and
empowerment, decrease the prevalence of ICU delirium, and thus reduce long-term AD/ADRD risk.",  ,,,,E W ELY,,(615) 936-2795,wes.ely@vumc.org,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,  ,

Due to decreased mobility, deterioration in activities of daily living, and neurological decline that contributes to
loss of bladder control, incontinence is a leading comorbidity for those individuals suffering from Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias (ADRD). Further, individuals with incontinence are susceptible to the
development of pressure ulcers (PUs), with nearly 40% of advanced dementia patients developing PUs.
Rightly, there is heighten concern that increasing rates of dementia will lead to higher rates of PUs, resulting in
increased suffering and mortality in the ADRD population. While the impact of PUs in the acute setting is well
understood, there is a range of potential iatrogenic skin injuries regarded as an inevitable part of aging that
remain underappreciated and under-investigated in ambulatory memory care units and assisted living (AL)
facilities. Maintaining skin integrity in ADRD patients is an ever-present challenge for healthcare providers and
caregivers, as well as a significant financial burden. Early detection of moisture events mitigates the
complications associated with incontinence, improving the quality-of-care patients receive. While efforts have
been made to address incontinence through product innovation, none have utilized a fully integrated systems
approach that incorporates unobtrusive sensor technology, early detection, and has a positive environmental
impact. Wicked Sheets, a Kentucky-based, woman-owned business, has developed the Wicked Smart Pad, a
washable and reusable, sensorized bedding pad system. It alerts caregivers when a moisture event occurs via
wireless communication, collecting vital information to support the care team. In Phase I, the PI and the
collaborating site, Atria Park of Great Neck, New York, will determine the feasibility and usability of the
sensorized bedding pad system, evaluate its acceptability by care staff and residents alike. Aims: 1: Evaluate
the feasibility, usability, and durability of the Wicked Smart Pad for individuals with ADRD in an assisted living
home. 2: Evaluate usage and acceptability of care staff interaction with the Wicked Smart pad. 3: Engineer
power-efficient firmware that collects and transmits moisture event data through a HIPAA compliant wireless
network, which integrates within the test site’s network on a user-friendly dashboard. At the end of Phase 1,
Wicked Sheets will have implemented the Wicked Smart Pad to patients with ADRD in an assisted living
community, received feedback on the bedding, hardware, and software from the end-users, and assessed the
ability to collect moisture samples. Phase II efforts will include device and firmware enhancements. This novel
technology serves as a prevention and intervention tool for care staff, ADRD family members, and the
healthcare community at large to reduce the burdens of the workforce and financial strain, enhancing the
quality of life and care of those individuals living with ADRD.",  ,,,,ALLISON  TRUTTMANN,,(618) 531-5284,alli@wickedsheets.com,,  ,

We will examine prolonged PACR-CT efficacy compared to Active Control (Casual Games) at 5 years after training by comparing 1) cognitive and functional performance, 2) structural (white matter integrity and brain volume) and functional brain changes (rsfMRI and task-fMRI) and 3) neurodegeneration assessed with blood- based biomarkers (pTau-181) predictive of AD risk. Next, we will examine the general booster efficacy (pre- vs. post-booster training), and the interaction between initial training and booster training by comparing the change scores between groups. Finally, we will modify PACR-CT schedule with the optimal booster training interval calculated based on the rate of natural cognitive decline measured from Aim 1 and the performance improvement from the 10 weeks of booster training from Aim 2. Evaluation of the longer-term effect PACR-CT and the booster effect will be used to obtain FDA clearance for the program and commercialize it as the evidence-based prevention device indicated for age-related cognitive decline.

Approximately 20% of the annual 795,000 stroke patients die within one year and 15-30% are permanently disabled. Antiplatelet therapy is mainly used for primary prevention of acute ischemic stroke in cerebrovascular disease. Bioactive fatty acids are a new class of molecular targets that hold great therapeutic potential because of their diverse role as signaling molecules that regulate metabolism and inflammation. The oxidation of arachidonic acid by 12-LOX results in the production of a number of bioactive lipids including the metabolite 12(S)-HETE. The lipid receptor GPR31, an orphan class A GPCR, is a 12(S)- HETE receptor recently shown to be involved in inflammatory signaling. We recently discovered that GPR31 mediates 12(S)-HETE prothrombotic signaling in platelets and promotes glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity in neuronal cells. Therefore, we propose that targeting GPR31 may provide a therapeutic path towards development of a safe and effective antiplatelet therapy that is coupled with secondary neuroprotective effects for mitigating against the acute neurologic sequela of stroke to provide a more effective and safer alternative option or adjunct to fibrinolytic therapy. We have recently succeeded in identifying the first effective GPR31 antagonist using our cell-penetrating, membrane-tethered, Pepducin technology to be validated in these preclinical IND-enabling studies as an anti-platelet and anti-stroke agent. We show here that this i3-loop derived GPR31 lipopeptide has potent antiplatelet activity and nearly completely suppresses arterial thrombosis without an effect on hemostasis in mice. Preliminary data with the GPR310 pepducin shows a highly significant reduction in stroke infarct area in mice similar to the protective effect of Gpr31-deficiency. Furthermore, we provide evidence for a direct neuroprotective effect of the GPR310 pepducin on HT22 neuronal cells subjected to glutamate mediated oxidative stress. The goal of this Phase 2 STTR project is to develop the GPR310 pepducin as a collaborative effort between Oasis Pharmaceuticals (Lexington, MA), Tufts Medical Center (Boston, MA) that would provide a robust IND data package required to advance the initial commercial development of the first GPR31 inhibitor as a dual antiplatelet, anti-stroke drug.

Enteral feeding (EF) is an essential medical procedure used to supply nutrients directly to the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract of patients who are unable to eat independently. EF formula is often
purchased as a ready-to-use liquid that contains carbohydrates, protein, fats, and micronutrients
to ensure adequate nutritional benefit for the patient. The addition of therapeutic probiotics to
EF formula has been shown to improve patient health and recovery, while reducing the cost
burden to patients and hospitals. However, specific challenges remain which have prevented
widespread use. These include:an instability of probiotics in nutrient rich, complex liquid mediums, includinghigh fat, salt, or sugar liquids and biphasic systems such as emulsions andcollo ids,a narrow list of compatible probiotics with marginal therapeutic benefit,a risk of cross-contamination during handling/reconstitution of powder probiotics,sedimentation/aggregation of probiotics, causing blockage of the feeding tube,inactivation of the probiotics by the acidic stomach environment, anda lack of proper adhesion and growth in the gastrointestinal tract.
A platform drug delivery technology which encapsulates cells and stabilizes the compounds
during storage and digestion while facilitating both mucoadhesion and direct growth on intestinal
surfaces has previously been developed and will be optimized for use in liquid EF nutritional
formula in this proposal. Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001, a microbe reported to support gut

sulfate 6-O-endosulfatase (SULF). SULF is an enzyme that removes the 6-O-sulfo
groups from heparan sulfate polysaccharides to modulate the functions of heparan
sulfate. Evidence has demonstrated that the level of SULF contributes to the
progression of cancers; however, the method that measures the activity from biological
sources is lacking. In this phase I SBIR proposal, we propose to use a LC-MS/MS
method to determine the activity from plasma and solid tissues. The crucial innovation is
that we will use structurally homogeneous heparan sulfate oligosaccharides as
substrates to address the issue for the selectivity of the measurement. In addition, we
plan to use 13C-labeled oligosaccharide substrates and coupled with disaccharide
analysis using a LC-MS/MS, which is expected to increase the sensitivity and add
quantitation capability. Aim 1 is designed to find the optimal oligosaccharides for purified
SULF enzyme, demonstrating the feasibility of using oligosaccharides to measure the
activity of SULFS, including both SULF-1 and SULF-2. We plan to test different
oligosaccharides in the size ranging from hexasaccharide (6-mer) to octasaccharide (8-
mer). Aim 2 is improve the quantification accuracy using 13C-labeled HS oligosaccharide
substrates and LC-MS/MS. Here, we plan to use 13C-labeled oligosaccharide substrate
in the analysis. The use of 13C-labeled substrate will eliminate the interference from
endogenous HS. Instead of directly measuring de-sulfated oligosaccharide, we plan to
degrade the 13C-labeled oligosaccharides into disaccharides using heparin lyases
followed by LC-MS/MS analysis. We expect that disaccharide analysis will significantly
increase the sensitivity compared to the measurement of intact oligosaccharides,
offering a sensitive and quantitative method to measure the activity of SULF from
tissues and plasma. In the phase II analysis, we plan to expand the analysis to a wide

Moreover, the healing benefits of music therapy and music-based interventions may be optimized when the patient is actively engaged in the process of creating music (composing, singing, moving), as opposed to sole reliance on receptive or passive music listening. The process of creating music has been shown to enhance neuroplasticity, reduce pain, and promote mental wellness. AD, in particular, as a neurodegenerative disease characterized by adverse neuropathological changes that impair neural connectivity and the brain’s natural ability to repair itself, is a prime candidate for the therapeutic neurological benefits that arise from creating music. Unfortunately, however, those who stand to gain the most from creating music often find the challenging process of relearning, learning, and/or manipulating a musical instrument to be impractical.  Outlier Technology (Outlier) seeks to address this issue by developing a novel, Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT)-based software platform to help modernize the rehabilitation and habilitation of function & well-being among people suffering from AD. This next-generation approach to NMT will offer the medical community an innovative new way to enhance neuroplasticity and mitigate cognitive decline. The hallmark of this platform is a proprietary algorithm which utilizes computer vision as an input modality to translate body movements into an interactive, aesthetically pleasing musical experience integrated with a data-driven curriculum of NMT-based puzzles and games designed in collaboration with Board-Certified Music Therapists (MT-BCs) to target therapeutic objectives. This platform can be utilized by therapists to augment their traditional treatment regimens or by patients who do not have regular access to therapy resources but seek the potential benefits of such use.  This proposal describes the development of a gesture-powered “smart instrument” that combines an interactive, adaptive, and therapeutic music creation experience with structured data analytics. Musical data from studio musicians will be sampled, analyzed, and mapped onto an aesthetically refined decision matrix that produces pleasing, software-generated music that may be customized to the user’s personal tastes. Computer vision will be used to map physical movements onto sensible musical outcomes to develop a “smart instrument” with intuitive, motion-powered haptic feedback. A curriculum of NMT-based games and puzzles that utilize this instrument will be developed with neuroscientists and MT-BCs to stimulate neuroplasticity and prolong functional independence. We will also integrate a data portal which allows the practitioner to record real-time patient events and notes about session progress, and access organized displays of data from each session which identify musical characteristics with strong associations to positive patient outcomes. The proposed development will yield a prototype demonstrating proof-of-concept for a groundbreaking new approach to AD rehabilitation.",  ,,,,PETER  GRAY,,3866975572,mathwriter2010@gmail.com,,  ,

Although this technology has broad applications ranging from industrial quality control to education, the beachhead sector to be addressed is precision agriculture. To feed a growing population of 10 billion in 2050, agricultural production will need to increase by 70% over the next 30 years. Critical to this mission is the development of innovative tools and strategies for crop protection and health management to preserve the world’s food supply. The potential customers in this segment are crop growers, consultants, and field scouts aiming to act early while reducing the use of harmful and costly chemicals. The global crop monitoring market was estimated at $2 billion in 2019 and is anticipated to reach $6 billion by 2027, growing at 15.3% annually. The sensing and imaging segment accounted for 49.3% of the market in 2019. This technology has the potential to support the adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices as well as the economic viability of small- to medium-scale farm operations in the U.S. by providing an accessible and affordable tool for disease detection and crop health management.

The intellectual merit of this project is the commercial development of novel and affordable imaging spectroscopy technology in addition to application-specific analytics for the early detection of crop afflictions. Optical components of the scanning device that will be designed-for-manufacturing in this project bridge the current gap created by systems that trade the detection capabilities of spectral resolution for spatial resolution. The scanner will be deployed to collect data on grapes, a key, high-value crop that is susceptible to a number of afflictions that destroy yields before the human eye can detect them. Machine learning algorithms will be developed from this data to detect stressed and diseased states in the plant before they become apparent to visual inspection. These models will then be validated in the field with user feedback from horticultural experts and customers. Successful implementation of this technology will facilitate the detection of crop diseases before they spread. This detection capability can increase yields while reducing the use of costly and environmentally-harmful pesticides and fertilizers.

Model cells for cancer research and drug discovery are currently stored using cryogenic methods that
necessitate powerful freezers and liquid nitrogen. Frozen cells require regular upkeep, have high energy costs,
take up a lot of space, and rapidly degrade if cooling devices fail. Efforts to develop a lyophilization protocol for
model cell lines have been ongoing for decades, however, loading protective agents into nucleated cells has
proven challenging. DesiCorp has developed a novel and innovative cell loading device, termed the high flow
acoustofluidic loading (HFAL) that can deliver protective osmolytes, proteins, and nucleotides into eukaryotic
cells. Unlike microfluidic loading techniques, HFAL uses large channel dimensions that allow substantially
larger volumes of cell suspension to flow through it at once. The cells are mixed with cationic lipid-coated
microbubbles that resonate with ultrasound waves, inducing cavitation. These cavitation-induced microjets
physically inject compounds from the surrounding media into the cells in suspension, which then repair any
membrane damage and seal membrane-impermeant compounds inside of the cell. This technology has
previously been utilized to load human erythrocytes with protective compounds, allowing them to be
lyophilized, stored at ambient temperatures, then rehydrated with over 90% cell recovery. A notable innovation
of the HFAL platform is the ability to load cells at high rates, exceeding 500 billion erythrocytes per minute.
However, the unique challenges of protecting organelles requires additional work to design and validate the
HFAL platform for eukaryotic cell stabilization during lyophilization. The specific aims for this proposal are 1) to
develop a complete, sterile acoustofluidic loading system that loads HepG2 and HEK 293 cells with over 60%
cell recovery, which will be measured using trypan-blue exclusion; 2) to achieve compound loading into HepG2
and HEK293 that is sufficient for their stabilization in the desiccated state, which will be measured using
enzymatic and colorimetric assays; and 3) to lyophilize HepG2 and HEK293 cells, store them at ambient
temperature, and rehydrate them with high enough recovery for culturing and their organelle structure should
resemble that of frozen and thawed model cells, which will be measured using fluorescence microscopy. The
main criterion for success of this phase I proposal is the fabrication of a fully integrated acoustofluidic loading
platform that successfully loads eukaryotic cells with protective agents that allow them to be lyophilized, stored,
rehydrated, and cultured. Lyophilized cell stocks have several advantages over cryogenically preserved cells,
such as the lack of ongoing maintenance and energy costs. Large storage devices, such as freezers or liquid
nitrogen dewars, are unnecessary for lyophilized products because they are thermally stable. If this proposed
work is successful, then cell stocks could be stored in drawers, binders, or even with the notebooks detailing
their creation, modification, and data associated with grants or publications.",  ,,,,BRETT R JANIS,,(847) 951-1222,brett.janis@desicorpinc.com,,  ,

Nearly 40% of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime. Diagnosis of cancer in later stages dramatically reduces treatment options, leading to poor prognosis and low survival rates. In addition, the average cost of treatment for late-stage patients can be 3–5 times higher than that for early-stage patients due to the potential need for multiple rounds of expensive therapies. These multiple rounds of treatment contribute to the high economic burden of cancer. Thus, detecting cancer earlier will not only lead to improved patient outcomes but will likely reduce the overall costs of cancer treatment. Moreover, a minimally invasive and highly accurate diagnostic could be broadly administered to effectively identify those with various cancers, enhancing the commercial potential further. _x000D_

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop an advanced microfluidic system for the isolation and assessment of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and CTC clusters (CTCCs) for cancer diagnosis and monitoring. Microfluidic devices in various forms have been developed to isolate the extremely rare CTC population from billions of blood cells, but these technologies suffer from three major problems: 1) low sample purity, 2) low numbers of isolated CTCs/CTCCs, and 3) CTC/CTCC heterogeneity. To overcome these limitations, this project will develop an innovative device for the simultaneous isolation and assessment of single and clustered CTCs and their molecular signatures, enabling the implementation of new, highly sensitive and accurate liquid biopsies for cancer. The key objectives for this project are: 1) Design and develop a hybrid microfluidic system for simultaneous isolation and concentration of CTCs and CTCCs with high purity, 2) Develop and optimize two devices for single CTC and CTCC analysis, and 3) Testing and validation using prostate cancer patient specimens. This research will lead to the development of a new cancer diagnostics platform that is minimally invasive and more sensitive and accurate than current methods, expanding treatment options and improving patient outcomes._x000D_

The resulting image volumes are more typically hundreds of GB to even tens of TB and for large volume electron microscope images of brain, can approach PB sizes. These file sizes pose challenges for image analysis, and communication of a representative set of raw data and quantification. Large files contain many structures, and require machine learning (ML) strategies in a context that permits error correction. Scientific communication requires tools for ready access to raw data, and more efficient methods to communicate the rapidly accumulating sets of scientific information. The rapidly accumulating digital library also affords a resource for teaching and training, which is largely untapped. We propose to leverage virtual reality (VR) to transform each of these challenges, capitalizing on natural abilities for stereoscopic vision and pattern recognition and, for scientific communication, teaching and training, auditory processing to process language and localize sounds. Based upon the tool base and direct volume rendering of large files that we have established in our VR software, called syGlass, we will first expand modern domain learning and so-called meta-learning techniques in the ML field to analyze images with few iterations from object counting to object tracking and tracing (Aim 1). Next, we will capitalize on new technologies for cloud rendering to significantly mitigate the hardware costs for adoption of syGlass (Aim 2). Finally, we will provide novel tools to efficiently generate narrated scientific presentations in VR for use in the lab setting, as manuscript publications, and for production of educational materials (Aim 3).

It is the most common cause of dementia—accounting for 80% of all dementia diagnoses—and predominantly affects older people. To date, AD has no cure. Thus, it is imperative to diagnose patients as early as possible to maximize the efficacy of symptom management strategies. However, existing AD diagnostic and monitoring options remain subpar, leaving urgent need for sensitive, reliable, and convenient methods to measure AD. New research suggests that electroencephalography (EEG) -based biomarkers can assess neural degeneration caused by AD long before tissue loss or behavioral symptoms appear. SPARK Neuro aims to unlock the full potential of EEG through a novel software platform: SPARK Scan. Combining EEG with the capabilities of machine learning, SPARK Scan better assesses cognitive health and neurodegeneration, aiding the diagnosis of AD. In the proposed Direct-to-Phase II SBIR project, the company will enhance the existing SPARK platform by developing a novel Alzheimer’s Disease Pathology Index that tracks patient amyloid and tau burden.

Major gaps: Mutations and deletions often occur in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (predominantly in the Spike protein) resulting in more transmissible and pathogenic “variants of concern” (VOCs) that can escape immunity conferred by first generation COVID-19 vaccines. Because most mutations and deletions that produced the 20 known VOCs are concentrated on the Spike protein, there is a risk that current COVID-19 sub-unit vaccines based on the Spike protein will fail to protect against future VOCs despite inducing strong virus-specific neutralizing antibodies against the original virus strain. Among the 80 mutations/deletions present in OMICRON variant, 32 mutations/deletions are concentrated in the sequence Spike protein alone. This emphasizes two major limitations of currently available vaccines: The need for second-generation universal coronavirus vaccines that (1) target antigens (Ags) other than the highly variable Spike protein; and (2) incorporate both B- and T-cell epitopes from Spike and non-Spike Ags that are highly conserved in all 20 VOCs and that will induce strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Our long-term goal is to develop a potent second generation universal CoV vaccine to stop/reduce SARS-CoV-2 infections and disease caused by multiple VOCs. Preliminary Results: We: (1) Identified highly immunogenic human B and T cell target epitopes from the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome; (2) Characterized human T cell epitopes from the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome that are selectively targeted by the “protective” immune system from asymptomatic COVID-19 patients; and (3) Produced a first prototype multi-epitope universal CoV vaccine candidate using the validated mRNA delivery system platform, and (4) Created novel “humanized” susceptible HLA-DR/HLA-A*0201/hACE2 triple transgenic mouse model with which to test 7 additional multi-epitope universal CoV vaccine candidates that bear different highly conserved human B and T cell epitopes spanning the entire CoV genome. We hypothesize that one or more of our 7 universal vaccine candidates will protect “humanized” mice from infection and disease caused by intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 a, b, g, d and Omicron VOCs. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1: To design and construct 7 additional mRNA-based universal vaccine candidates that will incorporate highly conserved B and T cell epitopes selected from 20 VOCs. Aim 2: To determine the safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 a, b, g, d or Omicron VOCs of 7 multi-epitope universal CoV vaccine candidates delivered intranasally in the “humanized” HLA-DR/HLA-A*0201/hACE2 mouse model. The durability of protection and its correlation with blocking/neutralizing antibodies and the number and function of CoV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ TRM cells that reside in the lungs and brains will be determined. If successful, the lead universal CoV vaccine that protects against most of the 5 VOCs could proceed quickly into an FDA Phase 1 clinical trial",  ,,,,HAWA  VAHED,,7147187110,hawasiraj82@yahoo.com,,  ,

Immunoassays lack the sensitivity, multiplexing capability, and flexibility to respond to the rise of potent synthetic drugs including fentanyl analogs and synthetic cannabinoids. GC- MS requires extensive sample preparation including derivatization reactions to achieve adequate performance. LC-MS, despite being a mature technology, is still not used by most labs for drug screening due to is high cost and complexity. We therefore see a both a technical and market need for better drug screening technologies that combine the simplicity and automation of immunoassays with the high sensitivity and specificity of mass spectrometry.

In addition to the disposable devices, we will also develop a simple manually operated and a second automated mass spectrometer interface which will enable analysis of the sample analysis cartridge on commercially available mass spectrometers. Finally, we will create instrument control and data analysis software package to provide a complete, end- to-end solution for drug screening.  In phase I of this proposal, a prototype for the disposable paper spray analysis cartridge as well as the manual mass spectrometry interface will be developed and tested. If the performance of the analysis cartridge and interface are adequate for screening a representative set of synthetic drugs, we will proceed to phase II. In the second phase, we will improve the sample analysis cartridge, develop a sample collection device which will enable robust collection of a known volume of blood from an unspecified initial volume, develop the automated MS interface, develop needed control and data analysis software, and test the performance of the approach on both high resolution and low resolution mass spectrometers.",  ,,,,JUSTIN M WISEMAN,,3179458514,justin@wikdevices.com,,  ,

Despite decades of research and commercial effort, society has yet to realize the widespread availability of affordable robots that can safely work alongside humans and assist them in their daily lives. A central obstacle in achieving this vision is the prohibitive cost and poor performance of actuators. Efficient, lightweight clutches that can improve robot operation time and safety at a competitive price are a gateway to the proliferation of human-assistive robotic systems into everyday life. For example, inexpensive motion assistance exoskeletons could improve the quality of life for millions of physically impaired people who are otherwise unable to engage in normal daily activities. Affordable robots could also increase access to expensive labor-intensive services, such as daily physical rehabilitation or full/part-time in-home care._x000D_

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be used to develop new materials understanding and correlate parameters such as morphology, dielectric thickness, and chemical modification to rotary electroadhesive clutch performance. The materials will be assessed for electrical and physical properties, as well as ease of incorporation into electroadhesive clutch assemblies and lifetime. Selecting optimal materials will improve fundamental performance while continuing to lower the weight, footprint, and energy consumption of rotary clutch designs. These research and development activities will de-risk the technology and enable the construction of a production-ready product. To efficiently achieve these goals, testing capabilities will be improved through the development of automated test stands to aid in rapid materials assessment, lifetime testing, and iterative design. For fundamental materials understanding, novel testing protocols will be developed that assess the electrical and wear properties of new materials, producing a widespread scientific impact in fields such as corrosion, coatings, and adhesion._x000D_

The innovations of this proposal include: (1) the pATHENA vector system for overnight conversion of phage display scFv or Fab clones into IgG molecules, (2) the Epivolve method for the isolation of site-specific Abs, (3) the incorporation of yeast display into pATHENA to allow biophysical measurement of binding affinities without the need for protein isolation, and (4) our MILKSHAKE technology for the validation of Abs for IHC, Western, and ELISA applications. This proposal is a culmination of- and largely a focused integration of several independent technologies that have been developed (and de-risked) by the principal investigator (PI). We now want to incorporate these technologies and add them into a single Abbratech platform. In essence, the proposal is a very robust set of molecular biology modules for: (i) library construction, (ii) library screening using both phage- and yeast display, (iii) biophysical and kinetic analysis, (iv) directed evolution, (v) affinity maturation (“AffMat”), (vi) protein engineering, (vii) production of site- directed Abs, (viii) protein expression integrated into a single platform, and (viii) Ab validation for flow cytometry, ICC, ELISA and Western applications. All parts of the proposed workflow have either can be- or have already been automated for high-throughput (HT) production with off-the-shelf robotic solutions. The proposed platform represents an innovative way to deliver recombinant mAbs, at ideally a retail total cost of less than several thousand dollars (costs are discussed in the Commercialization plan). This accuracy, specificity, projected timeline, and cost cannot be currently achieved by any other commercially available mAb discovery platform. This proposal meets a need that has not been markedly improved upon since the advent of monoclonal Abs forty years ago and phage display, around the same time. And it can finally place phage display as a primary engine of diversity, replacing the inefficient and time-consuming immunization schedules that even phage display advocates fall back on. The significance is high, the team is well-qualified, the innovation, tactical and strategic, is imaginative, and even though the scope of this Phase II is daunting, the team is well-equipped to do it.",  ,,,,MICHAEL P WEINER,,2036065394,mweiner@abbratech.com,,  ,

There were 1.5 million CIEDs implanted in 2011 and that number continues to grow. Between 1% and 4% of implantations result in infection, which have potential for severe morbidity and mortality outcomes. The mortality rate from CIED associated pocket infections can be as high as 66% if the device is not removed and up to 18% with device removal and antibiotic therapy. To address the need for additional methods to reduce or prevent these infections, 21MedTech is developing the ARRAY envelope for longer-term protection. The ARRAY envelope employs a novel bioresorbable polymer film that facilitates the controlled release of rifampin and minocycline locally following surgical implantation of a CIED. The envelope is highly tunable, enabling control over drug release and degradation time, and has been shown to be highly biocompatible in vivo. Prior to this Direct to Phase II proposal, 21MedTech has demonstrated safety and efficacy of the envelope material in vitro and in vivo and has demonstrated feasibility with controlled release of rifampin and minocycline over 28 days. 21MedTech has also shown improved drug release profiles over the commercially available TYRXTM envelope in vitro, which exhibits a burst release (>90%) in the first 24 hours. The goals of this proposal will be to optimize release of antibiotics from the envelope, assess safety and efficacy, and to determine the effective dose in a well-defined animal model. Success with these goals will advance the ARRAY envelope towards FDA clearance. Commercialization of the ARRAY envelope will improve CIED surgical outcomes and improve patient quality of life by reducing CIED associated infections.",  ,,,,JIAYI  YU,,3303564260,jyu@21medtech.com,,  ,

The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementia (AD/ADRD) is expected to nearly triple to a
staggering 13 million affected Americans and the total costs of care are projected to increase five-fold to 1.1
trillion dollars by the year 2050. Early detection of precursor stages of AD/ADRD becomes extremely important,
as it can introduce treatment or intervention earlier for potential AD/ADRD patients, given existing treatments
only have modest benefit at best. Early cognitive decline of patients is often under diagnosed by primary care
physicians (PCPs). A clinical decision support (CDS) tool that can automatically detect cognitive decline signals
from longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) and facilitate PCPs to make timely diagnoses would be highly
desirable, as it would result in early intervention for potential AD/ADRD patients. In our Phase I Equivalent work
at Harvard Medical School, we have developed a deep learning model for earlier detection of cognitive decline
using clinical notes in Mass General Brigham’s EHRs. Here we propose a Direct-to-Phase II study, which further
develops novel deep learning algorithms for the early detection of cognitive decline, implement them into a
clinical decision support tool, and validate the tool in a primary care setting. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will develop
novel ontology, NLP, and classification approaches to identify patients with early cognitive decline using records
from EHR and extract related evidence from clinical notes. In Aim 2, we will work with frontline physicians to
design, develop and evaluate a user-centered clinical decision support tool to identify and manage patients with
cognitive decline. The system, which we intend to align with evidence-based frameworks such as the CMS
Collaborative Care Model, will identify patients at risk (with supporting evidence) and prompt personalized
recommendations for timely care. Once the system is developed and fully tested, we will implement the
developed CDS tool in a simulated EHR environment at Mass General Brigham healthcare system, using real
patient data, and formally evaluate its utility and usability by recruiting primary care clinicians. This project will
deliver not only effective models for early detection of cognitive decline, but also a practical and validated CDS
tool that can improve diagnosis of precursor stages of AD/ADRD, thus facilitating early intervention for potential
AD/ADRD patients. If successful, it will be the first study that engages primary care physicians and real patient
data to validate the utility of such a cognitive decline detection tool.",  ,,,,JINGCHENG  DU,,(832) 591-4980,jingcheng.du@melaxtech.com,,  ,

Regulatory and societal pressures are forcing reconsideration of single use plastics, and manufacturers of plastic film must use recycled plastic at higher quantities. However, it is difficult for the manufacturers to affordably reincorporate single-use plastics due to the low quality and unpredictable content of the material. Increasing yield of usable plastics through use of the proposed technology is expected to reduce waste, offering the potential to annually save 6.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the US and Canada, and 28 million metric tons globally. Also, the greater use of artificial intelligence in manufacturing is of strategic advantage to the US, with the proposed technology also applicable to metals, paper, or advanced materials. Furthermore, skills shortages are impacting manufacturing and are likely to worsen due to a rapidly aging workforce. A great deal of on-the-job expertise will be lost in the coming years as a generation of experienced operators retires. The proposed solution can ease this transition, acting as an expert decision system to carry the intelligence forward and help maintain US manufacturing competitiveness._x000D_
_x000D_
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will apply artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and process control methods to plastic film extrusion, and subsequently to other types of manufacturing. Currently hardware solutions exist for manufacturers, though they can be expensive, difficult to use and maintain, and can require specialized skills to use. By contrast, the proposed technology is a software-based approach to the control of complex plastic film extrusion processes, particularly in the context of widely variable input materials such as recycled plastics. The AI software will be robust to changes in the production environment and will account for process drift over time. These technology capabilities are industrially novel and not known in the academic literature. Phase I outcomes suggest that the technology can automatically control extrusion processes to achieve optimal steady state production faster than is the currently possible via human control. The AI-based expert system effectively recreates the knowledge tacitly held by long-experienced factory operators. This type of industrial automation has the potential to be value-generating for the wider manufacturing sector. The proposed technology may be applicable to a wider range of extrusion manufacturing processes, such as extrusion of metals, paper or advanced materials._x000D_

Significantly, changes in the chromatin landscape can have a profound impact on DNAme patterning (and vice versa), and these changes are connected to development as well as a broad range of diseases (from cancer to neurological disorders). However, our understanding of how DNAme co-occurs / coordinates with additional chromatin features to control gene expression is limited by a lack of reliable genomic tools. Here, EpiCypher is partnering with New England Biolabs (NEB) to develop Targeted Enzymatic Methylation-sequencing (TEM-seqTM), an ultra-sensitive multiomic mapping technology that delivers high resolution DNAme profiles (5mC/5hmC) at epitope-defined chromatin features. EpiCypher is leading the development of ultra-sensitive genomic mapping assays that use CUT&RUN / CUT&Tag methods (under the CUTANA® platform) to generate truly quantitative data using dramatically reduced cell input and sequencing depth (>10-fold savings on each parameter vs. ChIP-seq). CUTANA assays are supported by EpiCypher’s proprietary spike-in designer nucleosome (dNuc) technology to enable technical monitoring and quantitative normalization. The key innovation of the TEM-seq project is the development of a novel multiomic workflow that marries EpiCypher’s quantitative CUTANA CUT&RUN technology with unbiased DNAme analysis using NEB’s enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq) approach. EM-seq utilizes the enzymatic conversion of DNAme (5mC / 5hmC) and provides a much-needed alternative to bisulfite sequencing (BS; a chemical treatment that degrades DNA and has systemic sequence biases) to generate high resolution, unbiased DNAme profiles with ~10-fold less sample input (vs. BS). In Phase I Aim 1, we will rigorously validate our TEM-seq workflow in three cell lines, benchmark results against standard CUT&RUN and EM-seq assays, and further develop EpiCypher’s spike-in controls for compatibility with TEM-seq. We will advance to Phase II when we demonstrate that TEM-seq generates highly reliable DNAme maps associated with histone PTMs and ChAPs using <50k cells and <10M reads. In Phase II Aim 2, we will expand development of spike-in control panels and develop robust protocols for a wide panel of chromatin features (using validated antibodies) and sample processing methods (fresh, frozen, and fixed), including drug treatment time-course experiments to enable clinical applications. In Phase II Aim 3, we will develop / validate a TEM-seq beta kit, and also create a data analysis portal and automated assays to accelerate commercial adoption and enable a high-throughput service offering. TEM-seq will provide a powerful new tool to expand our understanding of complex chromatin signaling, further unlocking the potential of epigenetics-targeted drugs and diagnostics.",  ,,,,MICHAELCHRISTOPHER  KEOGH,,2129605400,mkeogh@epicypher.com,,  ,

SummaryToday, 6.2 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), resulting in $355 billion in annual
medical care costs. As the US population over age 65 grows, the number of Americans living with AD is expected
to increase to 12.7 million by 2050. AD is a slow progressing disease, and it may take up to 20 years before
symptoms are recognizable. While new treatments are emerging, that may help to control or modify the disease,
early detection using a simple blood test is critical to individuals with AD. Importantly, recent studies have shown
promising results with blood-based biomarkers that are specific for AD. However, there is clearly a lack of high
affinity reagents that can bind to these biomarkers and be used to develop sensitive and easily accessible blood
tests.Aptus Biosciences will use modified aptamer selection technology, to create highly sensitive and specific
reagents that detect blood biomarkers of AD which cause neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a hallmark of AD. We
will deliver aptamer reagents developed from an improvised In Vitro selection method using hydrophobic
modified nucleotides that can bind to tau protein, and multiple isoforms of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein
with pico-molar affinity. Each targeted selection will generate aptamers that bind to various epitopes on specific
p-tau targets with picomolar affinity and that will be used to develop a simple bead-based aptamer sandwich
assay in which one aptamer will capture p-tau biomarker and other aptamer will result in a signal generation to
measure the plasma concentrations of these analytes. Our modified aptamer reagents are potentially better than
unmodified aptamers and large antibody-based reagents, which are not as sensitive or specific because of their
large size, low affinity, and cross-reactivity in multi-analyte assays. Specifically, we will use selections to create
modified aptamers that bind to specific validated phosphorylated isoforms of tau. In addition, we will develop a
simple bead-based multi-analyte aptamer sandwich assay to measure p-tau isoforms in plasma samples obtained
from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42 positive, AD-confirmed individuals and compare them with plasma samples
obtained from cognitively normal, Aβ42 negative individuals without AD.If this Phase I grant is successful, in Phase II, we will optimize aptamer reagents to improve the sensitivity and
specificity of the assay, scale-up aptamer reagent production, develop a cloud-based algorithm using a training
sample set, and validate the assay using test samples to correctly identify early AD in a large cohort. The multi-
analyte aptamer-based assay will make it far superior to existing qualitative, invasive, and expensive diagnostic
tests. If successful, this simple blood test will enhance the lives of millions of Americans who are at high risk of
developing AD due to the ability of the test for early detection, thus resulting in early treatment interventions
and decreasing the huge economic burden to the healthcare system.",  ,,,,BHARAT  GAWANDE,,(720) 250-6326,bgawande@aptusbio.com,,  ,

The proposed technical effort centers on developing physics-based models to interpret and predict transmission loss (TL) variability caused by hydrodynamic tilt associated with the SSQ-125 projector array and a hardware solution to measure and mitigate tilt effects. Ā The concept under development proposes the addition of motion and temperature sensors to the AN/SSQ-125 source sonobuoy. These sensors will provide a direct measure of array tilt, facilitate some insight into buoy drift, and provide much greater spatial and temporal estimates of the sound velocity field over the operation area (OPAREA). Monte Carlo simulations are used to assess the extent to which these measurements and interventions can improve the accuracy and reliability of detection processing, with an objective of a 25% improvement. The result is a performance simulation, hardware solution, and integrated algorithms that consume modeled and in situ oceanographic information, estimate the likelihood of occurrence of various physical phenomena that lead to SSQ-125 array tilt, mitigate the effects, and produce a 25% or greater improvement in MAC detection capability.

Metron also created a software simulation capability that they have named Multistatic Active Coherent Environmental Tactical Estimator (MAChETE). MAChETE incorporates the hydrodynamic model into a physics-based simulation to demonstrate the viability of the proposed hardware solution and supporting algorithms.Ā MAChETE will support mission planning for a MAC system that can opportunistically exploit SSQ-125 array tilt and SSQ-125 buoys that can adjust projector ping elevation. Ā In exploring this effort, Metron has also developed additional software approaches and solutions that increase MAC detection capability over traditional planning and employment methods that can be employed with or without Metron's proposed hardware implementation. The preliminary findings in our MAChETE simulations indicate that Metron's algorithms can achieve up to a 24% improvement in detection capability mid-mission and an 8-10% improvement in overall detection capability via mission planning software alone.Ā MAChETE has also demonstrated that the Adaptive Intelligent Transmission (AIT) hardware delay logic can produce an 8% improvement in MAC system performance in some multi-path scenarios.Ā Additionally, Metron's hardware and simulation approach indicates a more accurate CPD calculation than the current NAVAIR model is possible and likely required in conditions where ocean currents and hydrodynamic effects are prevalent. This capability will allow mission planners and operators to better gauge MAC system performance and realize an appreciable increase in detection capability.",John H Joseph,Engineer,3013422121,john.h.joseph.civ@us.navy.mil,John  Gebbie,,5035933294,gebbie@metsci.com,,  ,

ARMADA Marine Robotics has assembled a team of experts to address this need with this Phase II SBIR. This effort will build upon our successful Phase I Base effort that determined an A-Size (4.875” diameter x 36”) payload body as a suitable form factor for delivering a 5kg module. Under Phase I work we validated hydrodynamic simulations with in-water testing to quantify the effects of multiple payloads and payload configurations on vehicle endurance and controllability. In-water tests were conducted with proprietary hydrodynamic A-Size dummy payloads carried on a REMUS 600 UUV. It was confirmed that two A-Size external payloads would not decrease the UUV mission time by more than 25% and the parasitic drag of the mounting hardware would be less than 10% over the unmodified vehicle drag.  EPADS is based on previous work at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in deliverable transponders. The approach uses a payload that can be neutrally ballasted in a range of seawater densities, including freshwater, so that it has no effect on host UUV buoyancy when attached. Upon receiving an acoustic release command from the UUV, a motor opens a valve that floods a vacuum, making the payload negatively buoyant, and the payload detaches and descends to the seafloor target location. The UUV, which sees no net ballast change upon release of the payload and maintains neutral buoyancy throughout the deployment. WHOI has expressed interest in licensing and we will continue to partner with WHOI for development in Phase II. Work under the Phase II Base effort will include fabrication of the A-Size prototype designed in the Phase I Option, followed by bench, dockside, and tank validation testing.

The ultimate target of a three-phase program is the development of a small module (15%, dark count rate density 1MHz, across a minimum 50-nm window within the 200-375 nm UV spectrum, with visible light rejection ratio >1000. We choose SiC as our semiconductor material due to its high sensitivity in the target spectrum range, its inherent visible blindness, and low intrinsic carrier concentration allowing for a lower dark current level, all else being equal. Our previous generation SiC APDs exhibit high sensitivity and low dark count with excellent visible light rejection. Through the course of this Phase I program we will refine their performance by following a multi-pronged approach: First, we will fabricate new diodes using SiC wafers with an improved epitaxial structure, which should result in lower dark current and dark count and impact sensitivity and spectral range. During this fabrication, we will also improve the fabrication process, particularly the method to passivate the exposed sidewall regions of the sensor devices, which can also reduce dark count. Simultaneously, we will use our extensive background in physics-based SiC device modeling to design the next generation of APDs, with refined wafer structures, doping parameters, and geometry. The target will be to enhance the intrinsic gain of the avalanching mechanism within the bulk of the device, while suppressing leakage current generation and amplification on the surface or elsewhere. We will also use our process modeling experience to further improve passivation processes by modeling. Our device development will go hand in hand with readout circuit development as we create compact models of fabricated and simulated devices and use these to optimize, in particular, a Geiger-mode counter circuit. In conjunction with this effort, we will develop improved packaging solutions for our sensors, allowing us to prepare for the eventual design of an integrated modular sensor. As a first step on this path, we will integrate the diodes fabricated during this Phase I with a Geiger-mode circuit implemented on a small printed circuit board. This entire effort will be supported and guided by an extensive test and characterization program, allowing us to demonstrate a clear pathway to fully meeting and exceeding all the required specifications in a potential Phase II and beyond.",Anand V Sampath,,(301) 394-0104,anand.v.sampath.civ@army.mil,Zeynep  Dilli,,(301) 405-3363,zeynep.dilli@coolcadelectronics.com,,  ,

The deployment of large, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations presents an opportunity to maintain PNT in contested GPS environments. Emissions from these waveforms may be used in a non-cooperative Signals of Opportunity (SoOP) approach, whereby a PNT receiver passively receives these signals and deduces navigation information from them. Alternatively, a cooperative approach can be taken, where the receiver has knowledge of the signal structure, transmit time, and emitter state (i.e., position, velocity). These waveforms can be a vital source of PNT to US Navy platforms both by supplementing current PNT to enhance integrity and by maintaining PNT availability in Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) or high interference environments. IS4S proposes to perform a concept study and initial performance assessment of LEO-based SoOP that will enhance Navy PNT availability and integrity. Both non-cooperative and cooperative SoOP will be considered in the study. In the case of cooperative SoOP, IS4S will investigate new waveforms or potential modifications to existing waveforms that will optimize PNT for Navy missions. Tradeoffs of each SoOP, including their impact on receivers/user equipment (i.e., receiver designs and navigation approaches), will be evaluated and used to recommend approaches for moving forward.

Caliola is developing one such GPS alternative for the Navy. Our Satellite Communications [SATCOM] Antenna Pointing for Positioning (SCAPP) solution leverages the pointing vectors produced by the Navy Multiband Terminal while tracking a satellite in geosynchronous (GEO) orbit. A key lesson learned from developing SCAPP is that uncertainty in satellite ephemeris is the dominant error source for positioning from SATCOM signals of opportunity. Proliferated low Earth orbit (pLEO) constellations offer a far more diverse and robust set of signals from which to calculate a PNT solution than GEO constellations. It is much more challenging to mount an anti-satellite attack against an entire constellation spanning hundreds or thousands of satellites.

While recent advances in exciter and amplifier technologies have made significant enhancements in the availability of broadband, high-power electronics, a similar improvement is required for antenna arrays that can provide efficient, high-power coverage over large spatial, spectral, and polarimetric domainsŚincluding support of multiple simultaneous beams. In practice, conventional array technologies supporting these functions are not only highly specialized to their specific function, but are also subject to fundamental limitations associated with bandwidth, power handling/efficiency, scan volume, scan blindness, and polarization diversity. These limitations motivate exploration of a new class of non-traditional antenna arrays. Given the recent breakthroughs and advancements in commercially available RF electronics, there is an unprecedented opportunity for a shift in design philosophy towards combination of operational functions.

Many college-age youth with impairing mental disorders remain untreated because of concerns about stigma and privacy, inconvenience and wait times, and because universities are often unable to service all such students. Also, of critical importance, when referral for treatment is implemented, it is without regard to the person's pathology, because of the erroneous assumption that treatment need not be tailored lo the individual. This proposal aims to address this critical clinical issue. We advance that a sophisticated automated online referral system would resolve all of these problems, but there is no expert-trained system for psychiatric referrals. We propose to automate the referral process, designed for college-age youth, by bridging online, mental health assessments and curated, up-to-date, mental health provider networks. To this end, the non-profit Child Mind Institute is partnering with the for-profit MiResource. Assessment expertise is provided by the Child Mind Institute, which treats children and adolescents with mental health disorders, conducts mental health research, has acquired large assessment datasets, has in-house expertise in mental health assessment, and through its MATTER Lab has developed novel assessment technologies such as the MindLogger data collection and assessment platform. Referral infrastructure is provided by MiResource, a software-as-a-service solution designed to help universities connect students to local mental health providers. The MATTER Lab and MiResource will develop an automated online assessment and referral platform that uses expert-trained machine learning to provide users with personalized referrals for mental health care. Expert referrals will be based on the six dimensions of the Level of Care Utilization System (risk of harm, functional status, comorbidity, environment, treatment history, and attitude) applied to college students' responses to mental health assessments. In Phase I, we will (1-1) build mental health assessments into the MindLogger platform, (1-2) build an expert referral collection interface, and (1-3) set up a machine learning pipeline for training and testing an updatable classification model for automated clinically appropriate, personalized referrals. In Phase II, we will build, refine, and clinically validate our product for commercialization. Specifically, we will (11-1) validate the Phase I framework on a university population, (11-2) integrate Mindlogger's assessments into MiResource, and (11-3) conduct usability and quality assurance tests of the new Mindlogger plus MiResource platform, to get feedback about issues related to accessibility, relevance, accuracy, and esthetics, and incorporate solutions in response to this feedback into a final version.",  ,,,,ARNO  KLEIN,,3475772091,arno.klein@childmind.org,"CHILD MIND INSTITUTE, INC.",  ,

There are 24,000 stillbirths per year in the United States, and 2.6 million stillbirths per year
worldwide, with no significant decrease in the last decade. Abnormal fetal heart rhythms, such
as long QT syndrome, are thought to play an important role in these deaths, and may cause 3-
10% of unexplained stillbirths. This is in addition to known fetal arrhythmias, which affect 1-3%
of pregnancies per year. A magnetocardiogram is the gold standard to detect these disorders,
but is not portable or practical for widespread use. Other available tools such as ultrasound and
cardiotocography cannot measure the intervals needed to diagnose and guide management of
life threatening arrhythmias. The ideal tool for diagnosing and guiding therapy for arrhythmias is
an electrocardiogram (ECG). Unfortunately, clinicians do not widely use the existing fetal
electrocardiogram (fECG) devices for a variety of reasons: they do not work throughout all of
gestation, can miss brief arrhythmias, have a delay between the actual rhythm and displayed
rhythm, do not work in multiple gestations, and lack resolution of important intervals.
Our team has refined a prototype fECG during an ongoing R21 funded study. This proposal will
build on our preliminary work to create a compact version of the fECG which can be utilized
more widely in ambulatory settings. In this proposal we aim to:
1. Develop a compact amplifier system
2. Develop a new user interface
3. Pilot test the new system in a cohort of ten pregnant women carrying fetuses 22-40weeks gestation to determine whether it is comparable to or superior to the currentsystem in fECG quality and CTI measurements.
If successful, fetal cardiologists could use this tool to diagnose and treat known and latent fetal
arrhythmias. Globally, it could serve as a low cost tool to screen for arrhythmias that lead to
stillbirth and to monitor fetuses for compromise during surgery, maternal medication use, and
fetal interventions. Clinically implementing this critical diagnostic tool will be a landmark in the
field of fetal cardiology.",  ,,,,ANITA  KRISHNAN,,(202) 476-6552,akrishna@childrensnational.org,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,  ,

Broadband imaging optics are particularly valuable, especially in GPS-deprived battlespaces, but must be compact and light-weight for deployment on hypersonic vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and other platforms constrained by size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements. Nanohmics, Inc., teaming with Professor Alù’s CUNY research group, proposes to develop low-cost, light-weight, ultrawide-FoV metalenses based on ultrathin, high-efficiency cascaded nonlocal metasurfaces. Each metasurface in the stack passes most of the broadband light but precisely focuses a specific subband to the image plane. The proposed IR imaging system will be robust, durable, and compact, making it ideal to supplement or replace GPS guidance in alternate navigation systems needed where GPS is not reliable. Wide-FoV optical flow imagery can benefit the navigation of airborne vehicles in GPS-degraded environments. Inspired in some cases by the vision of insects and birds, vision-derived wide-FoV optical flows can be integrated with inertial navigation systems (INSs) to perform attitude estimation. In Phase I, the team will demonstrate the feasibility of ultrawide-FoV metalenses by designing, fabricating, and testing a small proof-of-concept metalens based on cascaded nonlocal metasurfaces, achieving TRL 3. Laboratory testing of a Phase I proof-of-concept metalens will demonstrate a 150° FoV, high transmittance, and operation in both the near-IR (NIR) and mid-wave IR (MWIR) spectral bands. Simulated performance will be compared with that of traditional optical systems, including SWaP and durability. The team will design a scaled-up, broader-band, high-performance prototype metalens that will be fabricated in a Phase II program. Rigorous electromagnetic (EM) modeling and simulation will predict system performance and help to optimize prototype design. Phase II will include fabricating and testing a larger metalens comprising four or more cascading metasurfaces and operating over a broader range of the NIR and MWIR spectral bands. Longer term, further development will expand the operational spectral band. The reduced volume and mass of metalenses and the overall IR imaging system will reduce propulsion load and overall system power requirements. The advanced capabilities and low SWAP of the proposed IR imaging system will make it valuable for a wide variety of applications and customers, particularly for GNC systems.

For many years the armed services have identified the advantage of multi-mode seeker capabilities.  For well over 40 years multi-mode seekers have been pursued through combinations of SAL, SWIR, IR, IIR, RF, GPS, MMW, etc.  Technology has been a major limiter in the field of combined SAL and SWIR imaging.  These technology loci have the advantage of being usable in a single sensor in a manner that is non-interference to the other portions of the sensor.  As with any imaging technology, the limitation of Read-out Integrated Circuit (ROIC) speed has made pulse detection at the speed of SAL difficult if not impossible until recent history.  The availability of newly minted ROIC technology has created a new opportunity for FPA (focal plane array) SAL detectors and difficulty in the form of updating algorithms to manage large pixel counts at high refresh rates in a real-time fashion. GRA’s proposed approach in this Phase I and subsequent Phase II is to harness the full capabilities of these new hybrid sensors by developing the next generation of software algorithms that will take advantage of the new dimensions of data provided by these sensors.  It is the goal of GRA to work closely with an industry partner in the development of a sensor package that will contain the needed hardware, software, and firmware to push new weapons into the modern era of man-in-the-loop systems with autonomous end-game guidance and control, as well as the potential for automatic target recognition and end-game target selection based on available targets in the field of view near the designated point.",Luke  Ausley,,(850) 882-4192,luke.ausley@us.af.mil,Miles  Foshee,,(256) 883-7000,miles.foshee@grainc.net,,  ,

The disease is characterized by cytokine-driven hyperinflammation and leukocytes count changes. The innate immune response has been linked to ARDS immunopathogenesis. In this regard, neutrophils have been highlighted as essential effector cells in the development of ARDS, as demonstrated in influenza and coronavirus infections. Therefore, therapeutic strategies targeting hyperactivated neutrophils may be useful for mitigating ARDS. The gut microbiota has emerged as an important regulator of the host immunity. Microbial components from the gut microbiota can regulate neutrophil functions, modulating the magnitude of inflammatory responses not only locally, but also systemically. The gut-lung microbiome connection implicates the gut microbiome as a relevant new strategy to lessen disease severity in viral-mediated ARDS. The current pandemic has taught us that we need novel, revolutionary therapies that can be deployed quickly and easily to the general population worldwide. In the context of viral-induced ARDS, targeting neutrophils, restoring airways epithelial cell barrier, and refocusing the immune response represents a critical and novel strategy that is neither limited by our understanding of the viral pathogens` biology nor by antigenicity or mutational status but can act broadly by leveraging the existing host immune repertoire. Rise Therapeutics is developing R-3750, a functionally directed synthetic probiotic that engages natural microbiome-associated immunological processes with the potential to diminish lung neutrophilia, reduce inflammation, upregulate regulatory T cells, and restore airways epithelial barrier to balance and reset patient’s immunological repertoire. R-3750 is inexpensive to manufacture, is orally dosed, and is stored stably at room temperature. R-3750, Lactococcus (L.) lactis engineered to express Surface Layer Protein A (SlpA), works via oral targeted delivery of SlpA to the intestinal tract where it engages mucosal dendritic cells lining the intestinal tract to reset immunological repertoires to blunt inflammatory processes. R-3750 induces exquisite differential gene expression leading to upregulation of anti-viral defense mechanisms and down-regulation of pro- inflammatory pathways. No safety issues for R-3750 have ever been noticed in animal models, and L. lactis is commonly ingested in our diet, as this strain is used as a probiotic and in the food industry. This Phase II proposal seeks funding to identify novel biomarkers and further understand R-3750 mechanism of action in several models of lung injuries, while completing key IND-enabling activities. R-3750 represents a new revolutionary therapy that combines the safety, economics, and ease of administration of a probiotic with the targeted delivery of an immunologically relevant protein that can quickly be deployed to save lives of virally infected patients with a hyperactive immune response.",  ,,,,CHRISTIAN  FURLANFREGUIA,,3019787151,cfreguia@risetherapeutics.com,,  ,

To exploit this opportunity, QuNav proposes to develop a GPS-denied Alternative Integrated Navigation (GAIN) system. GAIN integrates three key non-RF enabling technologies with mutually complementary benefits into a joint system architecture:    Inertial Navigation System (INS): INS supports a completely self-contained navigation without relying on external sources. Moreover, recent improvements in inertial sensor quality (particularly, for Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems or MEMS) enable INS-only functionality over extended periods of time. GAIN uses INS as a core sensor and applies the other two enabling technologies in order to (i) enable the system initialization, and (ii) provide aiding observations to estimate INS error states and adjust navigation outputs thus mitigating the output drift. Celestial-Aided INS: GAIN extends the stellar navigation with angular observations to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites (used for communication, navigation and remote sensing) for improved positioning accuracy.  Map-Matching of Earth Fields’ Anomalies: Navigation on Earth’s fields matches locally observed gradients to a geo-referenced global anomaly map in order to enable localization. A major challenge for this approach is the availability (or lack thereof) of precise maps of the Earth’s fields. To address this challenge, while exploiting richer features of anomaly (more high spatial frequency components) for mounted users at lower altitudes, we propose a two-step strategy. In the first step, we resort to mapping of and positioning relative to field anomaly sources using a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technique where no anomaly map or only a coarse map exists. Eventually a global map of desired quality is accumulated by piecing together learned local maps, enabling the second step of map-based global navigation. Yet, sparse collection of individual anomaly measurements, though useful in long run to build a dense map, cannot help immediate navigation initially without repeated circling in the same area for sufficient gridding and loop closures. In contrast, we propose to employ analytic inversion of Earth’s field anomalies into discrete sources for SLAM. The sensor fusion architecture utilizes a partitioned estimation approach with separated processing of (i) linear measurements via an extended Kalman filter (EKF), and (ii) non-linear measurements via a Bayesian particle filter.  Phase I will fully develop the navigation mechanization of GAIN and implement it as a post-processing software prototype and initially develop a prototype design approach for Phase II.",Christopher P Walter,,(443) 395-0101,christopher.p.walter.civ@army.mil,Andrey  Soloviev,,(740) 541-1529,soloviev@qunav.com,,  ,

ViTrack’s beat-to-beat accurate measurements, irrespective of patient movement or wrist level to the heart, provide the patient’s circadian BP pattern, including 24-hr mean BP, nighttime BP, and BP variability (BPV). In addition, ViTrack also measures heart rate and respiratory parameters and advanced hemodynamics. The hypertensive diseases of pregnancy (HDP) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The current standard for measuring BP in pregnant women is the periodic use of oscillometric arm-cuff devices. The oscillometric devices indirectly estimate systolic (SBP) and diastolic BPs (DBP) based on artery wall oscillations during cuff-deflation. Measurement errors inherent to this indirect method, patient posture/movement, and wrong cuff size lead to unreliable BP measurements in 50% of routine office visits. Oscillometric device errors are compounded in pregnant women due to hemodynamic and vascular changes that reduce oscillations of the arterial wall, resulting in BP underestimation. In contrast, these hemodynamic changes will have less impact on ViTrack measurements because it utilizes pressure-dependent spatiotemporal skin displacement to measure SBP and DBP directly. In addition, random clinic measurements during antenatal visits lead to a 30% wrong diagnosis of HDP due to white coat or masked hypertension. In addition, there is a need for remote and continuous accurate measurement of BP for prediction and early deduction of preeclampsia. The 24-hour BP parameters, such as 24-hr mean SBP, nighttime BP, and BPV, are better predictors of preeclampsia than clinic BP measurements. ViTrack, the first standalone, wearable, connected device, can provide remote, accurate circadian BP data for correct diagnosis and enable predictive monitoring for better outcomes. Our objectives in this Phase II study are: (1) to assess the accuracy of ViTrack SBP and DBP measurements in pregnant women and as well as in women with severe preeclampsia; (2) to evaluate patient tolerance (i.e., comfort) and reliability of ViTrack’s beat-to-beat 24-hr BP measurements, and assess usability; (3) to compare the 24-hr BP profile in pregnant women with and without HDP; and (4) to compare the number of hypotensive/hypertensive episodes with ViTrack continuous measurements vs. the current standard of care of intermittent cuff measurements. The data generated will validate ViTrack as the first standalone wearable technology for accurate and continuous monitoring of BP during pregnancy.",  ,,,,MOHAN  THANIKACHALAM,,6177759402,mohant@dynocardia.care,,  ,

Migraine affects over 36 million people in the US, particularly those of working age (18-55 years), negatively
impacting workplace productivity and presenting an enormous healthcare burden. For almost half of those who
suffer from migraine, current treatments fail to provide relief and have limited ability to reverse pain once it has
started. The most effective medications either require injection (CGRP antibodies) or are associated with
increased cardiovascular risk (triptans). In addition, none of these provide complete relief to most patients.
Migraine pain results from aberrant activation of specialized neurons that innervate the meninges, resulting in
the release of neurotransmitters that cause local inflammation, and trigger a pain signal to central terminals in
the brainstem. This signal is then carried to higher brain centers resulting in the perception of pain, and the
continued presence of inflammatory mediators in the periphery perpetuate this painful signal.
Protease-activated-receptor-2 (PAR2) is a membrane receptor that is activated by enzymes that are released
from immune cells in the meninges, over the course of a migraine attack. Its activation contributes to migraine
pain at multiple points: increasing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters; lowering the threshold for activation
of pain transmitting neurons; and promoting the synthesis of additional inflammatory mediators. The main site of
action of PAR2 is in the peripheral nerve terminals. This is in contrast to the targets of current migraine
therapeutics that also play major roles in the central nervous system. We have identified two small molecule
inhibitors of PAR2 that reduce migraine-like pain in animals. Significantly, these molecules act without crossing
the blood brain barrier (BBB), even when administered after the onset of an attack. In this proposal, we aim to
modify the chemical scaffold of our lead compound to improve its potential for oral delivery. We will use a high
throughput screen to examine inhibition of receptor activation and downstream signaling pathways. Selected
compounds will then be tested for favorable pharmacokinetics (e.g., stability, oral bioavailability, and low BBB
penetrance) and pain-reduction in animal models of migraine. The overall goal is to identify a lead compound
that can be delivered orally to move into IND-enabling studies for the treatment of migraine pain.",  ,,,,KATHRYN  DEFEA,,(951) 660-6652,sbirpi@parmedics.com,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS DALLAS,  ,

The planned offshore wind energy production in the U.S. has been growing rapidly and the industry is expected to be worth more than $1 trillion within the next two decades. Although only 42 megawatts (MW) of offshore wind energy were installed in the U.S. during the last 10 years, planned projects have been growing rapidly targeting 30 gigawatts (GW) by 2030 and 110 GW by 2050, with strong support from coastal states. Achieving the targets of offshore wind energy requires cost-effective and innovative components of these energy systems. One of the main costs for offshore wind energy systems is their foundations, with costs typically ranging from 14% to 34% of the overall project cost. OWTs are commonly supported on large-diameter foundations, which the U.S. does not have the capability to fabricate and instead relies on foundations fabricated abroad. Therefore, a U.S.-manufactured foundation system to support renewable offshore wind energy infrastructure, enhance domestic supply chains, and reduce dependency on foreign manufactured foundations is proposed. The result of this research is a U.S.-manufactured alternative with savings of over half the cost per meter, enabling wider adoption of alternative energy harnessing technologies._x000D_

The goal of the proposed project is to develop a U.S.-manufactured, bio-inspired, enhanced capacity foundation system to support offshore wind energy infrastructure that provides technical improvements and cost-saving to currently used systems. The proposed project also provides: (1) ease of adoption by providing similar weight and installation approaches to current means and methods; (2) better durability and longer service life than currently used OWT foundations; and (3) improved speed of construction promoting scalability. Furthermore, the proposed system will allow for optimized design, increasing the foundation capacity and improving the installation process.Preliminary tests show that the proposed design could improve the foundation capacity by up to 100% compared to that of the currently used foundation systems when subjected to long-term cyclic loading similar to those experienced by OWTs.The proposed concept could be used as a driven pile, suction caisson, anchors, or gravity base providing several options for the offshore wind energy industry in the U.S. To achieve the project goal, this research will focus on: (1) verification of key material properties for marine environmental conditions, (2) structural design of foundation cross-sections, (3) installation analyses on proposed foundations in marine environments; and (4) investigations of the effects of the bio-inspired design on foundation capacity._x000D_

Correct identification of parts as seen by the camera is the remaining unsolved challenge to achieving self-driven automatic measurements of parts. Most machined parts are textureless and most of the information is contained in the edges. Current image processing techniques work well with texture-rich parts but are unreliable with textureless machined parts. AI/ML enhanced image processing using edge and shape information is a promising approach, solving this problem will lead to the birth of a new generation of CMMs that can measure parts automatically._x000D_

Late-onset or sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitute 95 percent of all AD and APOE4 is the dominating
genetic risk factor. While there are three major APOE allelic variants (APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4), APOE4
carriers have an increased risk of developing AD, and up to 66% of individuals with AD-type dementia cases
and 64% with mild cognitive impairment, also carry the APOE4 allele. There are currently no treatments for
APOE4 driven AD or other dementias. Artery Therapeutics, Inc. (Artery; ATI) has developed a novel chemical
entity for the treatment of APOE4 driven dementias, including AD. CS6253 is a 2nd-generation selective ATP-
Binding-Cassette A1 (ABCA1) transporter agonist peptide derived from the C-terminal of apoE. CS6253 is a
safe, potent, and druggable ABCA1 agonist. ATI's preclinical data in cell systems and two different apoE4
transgenic mice models have demonstrated that CS6253 engages ABCA1 as a target, improves apoE
lipidation, prevents hippocampal amyloid-β (Aβ) pathophysiology, and improves cognition. In IND-enabling
studies, which showed excellent safety and pharmacokinetics properties, it was demonstrated that in primates,
CS6253 treatment over 9 days showed pronounced dose-response reductions in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
concentrations of Aβ42, Aβ40, and APP, and other markers. These data strongly support and extend our
efficacy results in mice pharmacology models and are predictive of efficacy in humans. Thus, with this SBIR
proposal, we will advance CS6253 into early clinical trials. In Aim 1, ATI will establish qualifying methods for
GMP drug product and stability at -20C for CofA and release for Phase 1 Clinical Trial Material. GMP drug
product will complete the CMC section (GMP drug substance is already produced) which will be added to the
clinical and nonclinical sections of the IND, for submitting the IND. The aim 1 milestone is to open the IND,
i.e. receive FDA buy-in for initiating the CS6253 Phase 1 trial. We are confident of a successful IND based on
the August 2020 pre-IND meeting with FDA where consensus was reached regarding key aspects of the
program including CMC, nonclinical and the initial clinical trials. In Aim 2, we will perform a randomized double
blind placebo controlled single ascending dose trial in healthy 50-70 y.o. men and women (n=8/cohort, 6
active: 2 placebo, total n=32) who will be characterized but not stratified for APOE isoform. Participants will
receive a single intravenous (iv) administration of CS6253 at 4 single ascending doses. Our Aim 2 milestone
is to establish safety and pharmacokinetics (plasma and CSF) in humans and a safe starting dose for the
multiple ascending dose (MAD) study. We will also explore transient effects on lipids and AD biomarkers by
CS6253 including temporal plasma – CSF dynamics of apolipoproteins and AD markers.
This project will determine CS6253's pharmacokinetics (plasma and CSF) and single dose safety, and prepare
for Phase 1 MAD studies of up to 30 days. Overall, CS6253 is an extremely promising ABCA1 targeting novel
therapy with potential to address APOE4 associated dementia including AD.",  ,,,,JAN  JOHANSSON,,(925) 230-8612,jjohansson@arterytx.com,,  ,

_x000D_
This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance the development of a new electromagnetic navigation system that requires the solution of several complex problems involving mathematics, computer science and electrical engineering. Millions of minimally invasive medical procedures are performed annually worldwide which include cardiac ablations, valve replacements, bronchoscopies, orthopedic procedures, cancer treatments, etc., all with increasing robot utilization. Electromagnetic navigation systems are widely used in these procedures providing knowledge of locations and orientations when medical instruments are out of the “line of sight”. Currently available systems, mostly developed before the wide adoption of robotic surgeries, can handle only fixed navigation volumes and are often unable to track instruments throughout the full procedure space, which may require the use of additional harmful X-ray radiation. Current tools use bulky field generators incompatible with imaging equipment and provide only limited detection and correction of electromagnetic interference-induced location distortion. This project will address these shortcomings. The electromagnetic navigation system which will have robust detection and mitigation of various electromagnetic interferences, will enable procedure-time adjustable navigation volumes, will allow high location sampling rates with multiple sensors, and will be compatible with intraoperative fluoroscopy and computed tomography (CT) imaging, allowing for key differentiating features required for commercialization._x000D_

Today, cUTIs account for 400,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States. Unfortunately, multidrug resistant pathogens are a common cause of cUTI. Many are resistant to the first-line antibiotic (Ceftriaxone), which is used as the empiric treatment of this condition. However, the high incidence of multidrug resistant pathogens causing cUTI delays the time until patients receive more appropriate treatment. Delayed time to appropriate therapy in cUTI has been attributed to extended hospital stays and an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. The current standard test for diagnosing a drug-resistant cUTI takes 2-3 days from obtaining a patient sample. Therefore, diagnostic tests that can rapidly inform the initial treatment of UTIs are urgently needed to improve patient care._x000D_

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a rapid urinary diagnostic test that will enable the detection of ceftriaxone-resistant uropathogens. Early detection of resistance to first-line therapies would enable antibiotic prescribing to be informed, reducing the risk of disease progression in patients. In the case of UTIs, disease progression can lead to severely invasive infections, predominately sepsis. Therefore, diagnostics that can detect resistance to first-line antibiotics enable early treatment interventions, reducing the time to appropriate treatment and reducing the risk of disease progression. Decreased treatment time also lowers the healthcare costs associated with drug-resistant cUTI, as disease progression is associated with increased lengths of hospital stays compared to susceptible infections. The completion of the Phase II project will yield the development of a prototype test that can provide actionable information regarding ceftriaxone susceptibility in less than 5 minutes. This project’s success will provide clinicians with a diagnostic solution for cUTIs that can be acted on immediately to improve patient outcomes and aid antibiotic stewardship by preventing the unnecessary use of inappropriate antibiotics._x000D_

(Canopy) proposes to develop a new Reusable Heatshields Additive Manufacturing (RHAM) platform, that allows rapid production of reusable TPS tiles with digitally defined tailorability. The proposed development of RHAM will leverage Canopy’s experience in advanced manufacturing of thermal protection system materials. RHAM advantages are made possible by the unique Canopy innovations that include: 1) New TPS material formulations that open up the space of usable precursors and manufacturing routes; 2) Unique implementation of a state-of-art binder jetting process to produce highly insulative ceramics; and 3) New heat treatment processes for forming mechanically resilient porous ceramics.
Canopy’s Phase I RHAM project will evaluate the technical feasibility of using an innovative additive manufacturing approach for producing TPS ceramic materials that exceed NASA standards, establishing the foundation for a new suite of high-quality tailorable TPS products.
In Phase II, the RHAM will reach technology readiness level (TRL) 6 and be ready for initial testing for potential transition to both NASA and commercial space companies.",SBIR NASA  Support office,,,,Matt  Shieh,,(859) 333-3696,matt@canopyaerospace.com,,  ,

The system's mothership will be a scaled adaptation of Turion's DROID platform, currently undergoing development for Space Situational Awareness (SSA) and Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) applications. The DROID mothership will be equipped with a gridded ion thrust to ensure maximum ∆V, an RPO computer vision system and CubeSat deployer. The Deorbiters will be designed based on an 8-12U form factor and emphasize commercial-off-the-shelf components with flight heritage to accelerate development timelines, scale production, and lower the Deorbiter unit costs with economies of scale. If a Deorbiter does not have sufficient ∆V to deorbit a debris object, multiple can be deployed and used on the same object, enabling the architecture to scale to larger debris, higher energy orbits, and reduced deorbit timeframes. In addition, each Deorbiter will operate independently of the mothership and, if issues arise, can deorbit itself to avoid creating additional debris. The architecture does not require additional hardware on the target object, such as docking adapters or communication systems. In addition, alternative state-of-the-art ADR methods such as throw nets, space-based lasers, the ion-beam shepherd, electrodynamic tethers, and robotic arms have drawbacks due to highly complex system dynamics and increased risk of further debris generation. The proposed mission architecture maximizes commercial utility because the mothership will collect SSA data when not performing the debris removal missions, and the Deorbiter system can be used for multiple commercial applications such as life extension.",SBIR NASA  Support office,,,,William  Figueiredo,,(951) 236-9442,bfigueiredo@turionspace.com,,  ,

The molecular and biochemical basis of tissue heterogeneity in normal and disease states can
be addressed with spatial omic analysis. Advances in spatial metabolomic analysis of tissue
biopsies using MALDI-MSI could enable the identification of numerous biochemical pathways as
signatures of specific histopathology features. However, to extract the most robust disease-
relevant biomarkers and pathways from spatial omics platforms will require quantitation of spatial
molecules for automation and statistical analysis. A key obstacle to adoption of spatial
metabolomics is the lack of rigorous normalization of biomolecules across tissue sections.
SygnaMap proposes to build MSI-DeepPath as a computational platform to quantify spatially
distinct metabolite abundancies with histopathologic features. Data from MALDI-MSI and bulk
metabolomics from serial sections of human kidney and liver tissue will be used as the data source
for our platform development. SygnaMap is developing MSI-DeepPath, a drug discovery and
development computational platform that incorporates ground-breaking improvements in MALDI-
MSI with computational pathology. Quantitation of spatial metabolomics for automation and
statistical analysis as presented in this SBIR proposal will enable the extraction of the most robust
disease-relevant pathways from metabolites. The rigorous deconvolution of structure-relevant
pathways will enable a highly impactful therapeutic target discovery and drug development
platform for use by biotech and pharmaceutical companies for development of therapeutics

In this DARPA Phase I SBIR, Alphacore and our partner Riscure will conduct a feasibility study to create a method of identifying which ICs are in a package through available side channels, without opening the package. A Grid-Array Side-channel Probe (GASP) system will be studied for possible development, comprising as many as 16 coil, with each coil simultaneously capturing the electromagnetic (EM) signals from the HIC. The HIC is provided with a stimulus (e.g., power on, or starting a particular device function), and the resulting electromagnetic side channels are captured. We are developing this coil matrix specifically for this research, while the capture and analysis equipment will be based on Riscure’s Inspector SCA tool suite.  In Phase I, the team will explore six aspects of investigation and classification of side channels in a HIC:  Validation vehicle creation  Signal capture (pre- or post-silicon)  Source separation  Feature extraction  Learning  Classification  Pre-silicon capture of signals can be used during the learning phase if the design details of the target are available, e.g., in the malicious behavior monitor use case. Pre-silicon signal capture is done by leveraging the existing simulation techniques of the DARPA SCATE program to capture traces for individual ICs.  As the number of templates grows, neural networks can be leveraged both in the feature extraction phase and the learning and matching phase, allowing generalization from ICs that have been characterized, to unknown ICs.  The classification takes as input an ‘unknown’ feature vector and the learned templates. It will provide a confidence score for each template, and thereby which IC / function is most likely. For the identification use case, the output is which IC / function is detected for each of the 16 signals that will be probed individually by the GASP system. For the malicious behavior monitor use case, the output is a confidence value for each of the 16 of observing malicious behavior.   As described, this method is a framework that can be extended with more templates, improved feature detection, different side channel sources, and so on, hence realizing a future (iterative) improvement path. We expect the method above to be able to classify with great accuracy both which ICs are in a HIC, as well as malicious behavior of a HIC.?  DARPA’s stated objectives for the Phase I study are to demonstrate a framework with an 80% probability of detecting various functions and components, and a 0.01% false positives rate, on a HIC with 2 ICs. The framework should be extendable, e.g., with improved analysis techniques and different side channel sources. Based on our plan, we believe that these objectives will be met.

Main St.,,Durham,North Carolina,27701,"ABSTRACT
Significant advances in the specific targeting of delivery vectors and the increased therapeutic efficacy of such
vectors for gene delivery have been made, stimulating major interest in the development and
commercialization of therapeutic products focused on gene therapy indications. CLAIRIgene LLC focused on
the development and optimization of various viral gene-to-cell transfer delivery platforms targeted a broad
range of applications, including CRISPR/Cas9 systems. Of the gene therapy products in development, we
focused on recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV)-based vectors and Integrase-Deficient Lentiviral
Vectors (IDLVs), as they show the greatest potential for delivery in gene therapy indications. Both systems
operate at transient “hit-and-run” mode, associated with minimal integration levels, which substantially reduces
the risk of insertional mutagenesis, oncogenesis and other associated toxicities, therefore is highly
advantageous for gene therapy applications. Furthermore, we recently evolved these non-integrating vectors
onto efficient and safe delivery vehicles for gene-to-cell transfer of CRISPR/Cas9 components into various
primary cells and tissues, including post-mitotic neurons in vitro and in vivo. Notwithstanding these
advantages, episomal vectors, including IDLV and AAV expressed at relatively low levels, as their genomes
are packaged into heterochromatin structures, largely inaccessible by transcription machinery. Consistently,
we previously demonstrated that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACsi) added during vector production step
can dramatically increase its titer and transduction efficiency. Nevertheless, most small-molecule-based HDAC
inhibitors are non-selective, and evidently demonstrate high-level of undesirable off-target activities, including
cell cycle arrest, changes in cellular differentiation and apoptotic signaling. Therefore, more selective and
targeted strategies aimed to downregulate expression of HDAC-of-interest are needed. The current proposal is
based on our preliminary data demonstrated that class I of the HDAC family HDAC8 could play an important
role in the regulation of life cycle of episomal vectors, including AAV and IDLV. We have shown that vector-
producer cells, human embryonic kidney HEK293T knockouted for HDAC8 support the improved packaging
and titer of the vectors.
In the current proposal, we aim to create (i) a stable, monoclonal producer HDAC8-/- HEK293 cell line for more
efficient production of AAV and IDLV vectors. Following characterization and optimization, we aim to certify
the product for a range of gene therapy applications using viral vectors as delivery systems. To evaluate
whether the developed cells could be used universally for production of other non-integrating systems, we will
aim in the future testing them for manufacturing adenovirus (Ad), herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1), and non-
human lentiviral vectors. The growing pipeline of cell and gene therapies has led to a substantial increase in

However, most celestial scenes are extremely sparse, featuring relatively few stars on a fixed black background, wasting power and data processing on nearly featureless images. The inefficient data usage combined with motion blur associated with platform motion limits typical star trackers to operation below 5 degrees per second. This low operational speed: can lead to lost in space failure modes; limits application to highly dynamic platforms; and requires intermittent recalibration for some platforms, which reduces up time. Event cameras excel at imaging highly dynamic sparse scenes with no motion blur, and are an emerging technology that Areté believes will be an enabling technology for next generation star trackers. Areté will establish the viability of event cameras for star tracking applications through a series of laboratory based calibrations with current generation state-of-the-art event cameras and will design a brass-board system known as the Areté Neuromorphic Star Tracker (AN-ST). The AN-ST will be based on existing Areté algorithms for event camera processing and star catalog mapping algorithms developed for previous programs. If the current generation technology is viable, the AN-ST will enable a new generation of extremely fast attitude determination systems. If current technology is insufficient to meet the requirements for this application, Areté will provide a roadmap for further development, and partner with event camera manufacturers to encourage sensor development. The AN-ST will build on Areté’s experience in accurate object tracking with event camera data, and existing codebases for stellar navigation, allowing an efficient trade study focused on investigating novel components and not recreating existing algorithms/techniques",Jeffrey  Ganley,,(505) 853-6660,jeffrey.ganley@spaceforce.mil,Rees  McNally,,(303) 651-6756,rmcnally@arete.com,,  ,

However, tunable wavelength group III-V IR detector materials systems, e.g., InAsSbBi, GaAsBi, etc suffer from non-optimal growth conditions, which results in defects. Defects ranging from Bi segregation, surface droplets, interstitials, and vacancy formation to dangling bonds can generate scattering centers and can be responsible for reduced carrier lifetime and higher dark current. JP Analytical, in collaboration with the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) proposes to understand the nature of the defects and thereby attain an optimized passivation technique for such defects. Hydrogenation is found to be effective in influencing the electrical properties of Si, group III-V optoelectronic materials, as well as several other heterostructure systems in passivating growth-related defects. While hydrogenation, in general, will be used as a means of passivating defects to enhance the carrier lifetime and to reduce the dark current of the InAsSbBi-based IR detectors, the distinguishing facts of JP Analytical come from the analytical capabilities and hydrogenation innovations. Positron beam-aided defects characterization in a depth-resolved manner will provide defect insight and evidence of passivation. Using a depth-resolved measurement of the Doppler broadening of the electron-positron annihilation radiation, it is possible to obtain selective information regarding charged open volume defects and the chemical environment of the defect site. Sensitivity to the chemical environment of the open volume defect becomes important when the neutral or charged vacancies get passivated by hydrogen.   As such, the intellectual merit offered by JP Analytical and their collaborators at UTA includes the following: (a) Defect characterization: The identification of the electrical effects of and pre and post-passivated materials system can lead to optimized defect passivation, and (b) Hydrogenation at higher temperature and pressure: As the optimized Bi incorporation required higher growth temperature, hydrogenation defect passivation will be evaluated at higher temperatures and under pressure to thermally remove some of the unpassivated or unpinned defect centers without causing Bi to be segregated out of the solid solution.   If successful, positron-beam aided characterization and hydrogenation can be implemented for other materials systems that suffer non-optimal growth conditions to detect and pin down vacancies and passivate defects.",Preston  Webster,,(505) 846-2178,preston.webster.2@spaceforce.mil,Khalid  Hossain,,(580) 319-8198,info@jpanalytical.com,,  ,

Small defects, such as gaps, voids, cracks, and foreign materials, in the chemical makeup of the energetic material can lead to unforeseen chemical reactions that have lessened or increased the potency of the energetic material, that would lead to costly, hazardous, or even life-threatening misfires. Currently, energetic filled parts are manually inspected for critical defects during the manufacturing process using x-ray imagery. Manual assessment is not only costly, laborious, and time-consuming, but also prone to error and inconsistencies. In addition, x-ray imaging cannot adequately penetrate the metal shell surrounding the energetic material to show the condition of the chemicals within. Therefore, the Army has a critical need for accurate and reliable detection of energetic defects to eliminate defective parts from leaving the production floor, thereby reducing the potential for hazardous incidents in the field.   To address this problem, Sky Park Labs (SPL) proposes EnergeticAI, an AI system that analyzes neutron radiographic images (n-rays) to automatically identify and localize energetic defects. Unlike X-ray radiography, neutron radiation can easily penetrate a high density metal containment such as the metal shell surrounding energetic material and interact with the lighter chemicals within. As a result, n-rays can image defects like cracks, voids, gaps, foreign materials in the energetic material that cannot be detected with x-ray, x-ray CT or any other non-destructive testing method. EnergeticAI uses “weakly supervised” machine learning to learn normal patterns exclusively from readily available, fault-free, n-ray images of munitions and highlights the location of deviations as potential defects.

However, the lack of a strong foundation in mathematics means students are less likely to pursue STEM majors and careers (Chen, 2013; Griffith, 2010; Huang, Taddese, & Walter, E, 2000; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Lowell et. al., 2009; Seo, Shen & Alfaro, 2019). Students from low-income families, women, and underrepresented minorities are also less likely to major in STEM (Bettinger, 2010; Griffith, 2010; Hill, Corbett & Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010). Improving math learning in the elementary grades is important to ensure children have the essential foundational skills and strong self-efficacy beliefs to be able to succeed with later mathematics and pursue careers in STEM. With this Fast-Track grant, we propose to build a mathematical problem-solving environment, Teachley Problem Solving (TPS), to transform the way elementary students learn to solve math problems. TPS will include a set of digital tools to help students understand and classify the underlying structure of problems, use clear visuals to model the mathematics of the problems, and construct strong mathematical arguments. The environment will also integrate into ASSISTments, a math curriculum platform built by The ASSISTments Foundation and Wooster Polytechnic Institute .  Outcomes. The proposal will encourage two main outcomes, namely: 1) improved student math achievement and 2) increased math self-efficacy. A key research aim is to determine whether supporting elementary students with digital problem-solving tools helps them develop stronger problem-solving skills as compared to typical instruction. We also anticipate that using the engaging tools with real-time feedback will also bolster students’ motivation and self-efficacy in mathematics.  Improving students’ academic outcomes and math self-efficacy during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since the number of advanced math classes students take is correlated with likelihood to complete a STEM degree, (Chen, 2013) a distal outcome of this proposal is increasing the number of students pursuing careers in STEM.",  ,,,,KARA  CARPENTER,,4155160184,kara@teachley.com,,  ,

Coalition forces need a remote capability to cross enemy fire-covered terrain and provide them time and space to conduct advantageous actions that “place the enemy under the pressures of uncertainty”. However, current coalition remote capabilities are too expensive to be deployed in sufficient quantity for large-scale operations or swarming mission objectives. Close-range battlefield UAVs execute a myriad of roles, usually at low altitude, within as rapid a response time as possible all while maintaining full mobility within restricted terrain (complete mobility of Ground Control System (GCS), launch and recovery equipment). Current market drones do not fulfill all these roles at a price point applicable for large-scale deployment, leaving a capability gap shared across DoD and other government agencies. The Capability Need Statements (CNS) addressed by the Inexpensive Long-range Endurance Drone (ILED) concept are (1) low cost and (2) small logistics footprint for single use (non-recoverable) while being modular enough to (3) accept different payloads and (4) conduct a variety of missions. Our objectives in Phase I were optimization analysis, subsystem integration feasibility, and to down select concept options/variations to a best concept form of the KIHOMAC Concept (ILED). While there are a nearly infinite number of design choices, some were easily removed from contention due of the relatively few benefits they provided. While a couple of unconventional designs were explored, any development path that incurred an impassible consequence to a CNS was eliminated. Motor placement, avionics systems selections, wing folding, and deployment concepts were guided by the ILED concept. Desired capability and performance analysis further developed (i.e., filled the gaps) and defined derivative requirements, informed constraint analysis and configuration alternatives.  Our objective in Phase II is to build, test and conduct a full flight demonstration that meets performance metrics, achieving a flight qualified test and demonstration that the KIHOMAC ILED design concept fulfills the CNSs. Structured, and repeatable feasibility analysis has generated positive results on all four capability needs and affirmed that KIHOMAC ILED could meet or exceed nearly all performance metrics, it will be within expected cost range and that we can produce it. Two alternate design paths identified by the trade studies to achieve better payload capacity and dash speeds are limited by the survivable launch velocity of the internal avionics, maximum permissible force of the launch system and achievable All-Up-Weight.",Timothy N Klausutis,Program Manager,(703) 526-2267,timothy.klausutis@darpa.mil,Howard  Hornsby,,(850) 803-2396,howard.hornsby@kihomac.com,,  ,

The axial mode helical antenna is widely utilized in satellite communications and has a number of very attractive properties [J.D. Kraus, ""The Helical Antenna"", Proc. of IRE, Vol. 37, 3, 1949].  The antenna has a very broad impedance bandwidth (typically 40% or more) with a high input impedance of 100 – 150 Ohms.  Then antenna generates a circularly polarized beam on-axis with excellent axial ratio when the circumference of one turn of the antenna is comparable to a wavelength.  The helix also has good directivity (10 dBi or more for 3 – 4 turns) and easily integrates with a coaxial output port.  Though it has many positive properties, using helical antennas for HPEM applications requires particular care in order to accommodate the high fields both at the feed and throughout the windings.  Compromises are needed at the coaxial output, and often the use of a pressurized radome containing SF6 or another gas is required.  However, an additional advantage of helical antennas is that they are easily arrayed, which opens the possibility of power sharing among elements.  In the event that a radome is required, ASR has extensive experience in developing high pressure radomes for helical antennas.  ASR worked with Spencer Composites to deliver 2 pressurized radomes to PEO STRI for use with the WBTS sources at WSMR. The COBRA antenna was originally proposed and demonstrated by Courtney and Baum as a reflector antenna, and was later adapted to a lens configuration.  The COBRA antenna uses a large coaxial output to feed a focused aperture antenna.  Normally the TEM mode from a coax does not radiate efficiently, but the COBRA antenna introduces a phase delay in the four quadrants of the aperture. The COBRA antenna has the advantage of very conveniently coupling to a coaxial output with arbitrarily high power; there is no additional field enhancement created by the antenna geometry.  The reflector version can be made compact through the use of a hyperboloidal sub-reflector in a Cassegrain configuration.  The impedance bandwidth of the COBRA can be very broad, but the phase delay introduced by the petaled reflector (or lens) is wavelength dependent.  So while the return loss is good, the quality of the circular polarization is compromised.  Data are limited in the literature about the polarization quality as a function of bandwidth, and we will explore that issue in Phase 1 of this program.  Operation at the two distinct frequencies (1.1 GHz and 2.8 GHz) simultaneously, will be very challenging.  However an antenna that can provide both a good input impedance and high quality circular polarization will be a major step forward.",Daniel  Enderich,,(505) 544-9057,daniel.enderich.1@us.af.mil,Michael  Abdalla,,(505) 830-3000,mda@asrcorporation.com,,  ,

(BFC) and MAK Technologies (MAK) propose MUD CRANE: Multi-Domain C2 RL Training Environment. The need for simulating multi-domain operations (MDO) is pressing, with the first Defense priority in the upcoming 2022 National Defense Strategy highlighting the “…growing multi-domain thread posed by the PRC [People’s Republic of China]”. MDO presents both opportunity and challenge for Joint Forces as it provides a plethora of options to commanders to execute simultaneous and sequential operations. The tempo and complexity of command and control (C2) decision-making increase in MDO scenarios, with forces seeking windows of superiority for temporary dominance over an adversary. MUD CRANE will allow war planners to leverage advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly within deep reinforcement learning (DRL), to support their decision-making. These algorithmic approaches have proven adept in numerous strategic settings, beating human champions at the strategic games of Go and StarCraft 2. MUD CRANE will support applying these techniques within the military decision-making process (MDMP) to enable faster, more robust course of action (CoA) planning support in MDO. Furthermore, MUD CRANE will support Army researchers seeking to develop relevant, cutting-edge DRL agents in support of this mission. Effective DRL approaches require simulation environments which rest on the three pillars of very high speed execution, multi-domain richness/fidelity, and specialized AI/ML interfaces. An environment must execute fast enough to generate massive amounts of training data for DRL techniques in an operationally relevant window of time, must include enough realism for DRL agents to learn meaningful strategies transferrable to the battlespace, and must include flexible interfaces enabling DRL model experimentation, updates, and replacements. MUD CRANE will offer: (1) A high-speed, multi-domain, operationally relevant high-fidelity simulation environment which is broadly accepted within the DoD community with built-in scalability and open communication standards; (2) Flexible machine interfaces for training DRL agents, allowing for user-defined observation and action spaces and plug-ins for calculating custom reward functions. Additional interfaces will include tools for generating stochastic scenarios varying force laydowns and compositions, Red and Blue CoAs, as well as environmental factors such as weather and time of day; (3) A framework for human interaction with the DRL training process, creating a teaming environment for CoA generation; (4) Plug-ins for quantifying custom metrics, including CoA complexity measurements; (5) Well-documented exemplar DRL agents for experimental demonstrations; and (6) A researcher-centric framework allowing each entity to be controlled by a DRL agent, default (scripted) behaviors, or user-defined behavior trees.",Priya  Narayanan,Mechanical Engineer,(301) 394-2376,priya.narayanan.civ@army.mil,Jay  Miller,,(413) 426-8904,jay.miller@bostonfusion.com,,  ,

In particular, this effort will aggressively enhance the capabilities of zero-power IR sensors for people presence detection by focusing on extending the detection range to > 3 m, increasing accuracy (i.e., reducing both false negatives and false positives) and miniaturizing the device formfactor while maintaining a long battery lifetime. The core element of the zero-power IR sensor technology is a micromechanical photoswitch capable of harvesting the IR energy from the target of interest to perform sensing and signal processing functions without consuming any electrical power in standby. The proprietary technology was developed by Zepsor for human body detection at a close distance (~ 1 m) without the need of any bulky optics. All the focused areas in this project are crucial for the technology to be fully utilized in defense and intelligence applications. For example, extended detection range from 1 m to 3 m will allow the sensor to cover most of the points of interest in an indoor environment such as entry way and Āhallway. The reduced size (down to a pool cue tip) makes the sensor extremely concealable even for challenging deployment such as inside a door handle or door lock. Moreover, size of the sensor also matters for identified civilian applications such as the touchless interface for hygiene products and smart home devices. We found that a miniaturized IR sensor that occupies less space than existing active IR proximity sensor or passive IR sensor with a Fresnel lens will greatly help aesthetic design of the products for consumer market. The last but not least, increasing the overall accuracy while keeping the key differentiator of near-zero power consumption in standby is critical for all the applications. The high detection probability ensures almost no event of interest will be missed while the low false alarm rate gives high credibility to the sensor reported data, which ultimately leads to valuable intelligence or correctly performed functions. The technical objectives will be achieved through a series of proposed R&D activities including device and system level innovations and engineering work. The table below summarizes the specific objectives of the Phase II work and related technical approaches based on the Phase I results. Each of the approaches and corresponding feasibility study will be detailed in the next section.",Daniel N Ridge,Program Manager,7035262290,daniel.ridge@darpa.mil,Zhenyun  Qian,,6177848727,qian@zepsor.com,,  ,

If the probability of finding an “intelligence golden nugget” is proportional to the amount and diversity of data ingested, the design reasoning goes, then more data and more sources of data increase the probability of finding something important. JDM Solutions understands this perspective on intelligence analysis, but also acknowledges that a more-is-better approach doesn’t necessarily lead to more insightful or timely analysis.  Some analysis problems are matters of finding a “nugget” in a sea of data and connecting the dots. Analysts are often tasked with a Sherlock Holmes style job of finding patterns of behavior for a potential target or patterns between multiple potential targets.  In these cases, the quantity of data ingested as a measure of a system’s potential analytic power is secondary to the measure of the quantity of connections that can be made across disparate elements of data. Our vision for an Automated Framework for Target Enrichment and Activity Modelling (AFTEAM) will move from simple situational awareness to true understanding. This will require data from all sources relating to an entity or target to be processed and fused in real-time.  The data processed includes traditional sources such as radar plots and tracking reports, as well as unstructured sources such as situation reports, engineering documents and intelligence assessments.  It also includes information about a targets environment, such as geospatial and weather data.  A major obstacle to reliably, quickly, and automatically finding the relationships that exist across these large, diverse data sets, is the difficulty in automating the processing of unstructured and semi-structured text. These are the places that true insights live. The AFTEAM will provide a solution that both reduces risk through use of proven capabilities while at the same time delivering more capabilities within a shortened timeline.  The resulting microservices and containers will provide modular solutions that will readily support integration into the Insight program as well as any other application or system built using modern DevSecOps best practices. ",Stephen  Thomas,,(937) 713-8767,stephen.thomas.14@us.af.mil,Justin  King,,(256) 655-4646,Justin.king@jdmsolutions.com,,  ,

The simulator will be based on an existing government-owned modeling, simulation, and analysis (MS&A) tool, the Advanced Framework for Simulation, Integration, and Modeling (AFSIM). AFSIM not only meets the baseline requirements of AI for C2 in MDO via existing add-on capabilities for a bidirectional Python application programming interface (API), much faster-than-real-time simulation speeds, scalability to distributed computing, ability to randomize environment conditions to learn robust policies, adaptability to flexibly model realistic combat characteristics, and existing protocols for user interaction, it exceeds these requirements for reinforcement learning (RL) through the benefits of discrete event simulation (DES) scenario execution, a rich scripting environment that allows for the creation of complex scenario logic, and pre-existing AI implementations such as finite state machines and behavior trees. We will create an OpenAI Gym environment, AfsimEnv, that controls the discrete event incrementation of an AFSIM simulation via Python bindings of AFSIM simulation objects. This environment will enable bidirectional message passing to address interface requirements of the RL state/action/reward cycle and will support MDO policies at multiple echelons including squad, platoon, brigade, division, and corp. We will utilize the AfsimEnv environment to train a policy via RL on an example brigade-level stochastic scenario, an MDO extension of the Tiger Claw scenario baseline. We will also demonstrate the path forward for parallel, distributed data collection for distributed AfsimEnv experience gathering on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters. First, we will demonstrate this capability using community open-source tools, such as Ray’s RLlib package, which can extend any OpenAI Gym environment to highly distributed RL workloads. Second, conditioned on complexities with the DoD Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs), such as inbound networking to DSRC resources and time constraint limitations on GPU-enabled nodes, we will investigate the integration of RLlib with a government-owned tool developed by Stellar Science, Galaxy, that aids in the coordination and deployment of jobs across multiple HPC clusters. Finally, we will invoke existing human-in/on-the-loop (HITL) interactions with AFSIM, to include the distributed wargaming tool, Warlock, as well as standard protocols that interoperate with a running AFSIM simulation, to explore extended reality (XR) scenario interactions as well as augment policy training with expert HITL player actions within the environment.",Priya  Narayanan,Mechanical Engineer,(301) 394-2376,priya.narayanan.civ@army.mil,Kyle  Ulrich,,(877) 763-8268,kulrich@stellarscience.com,,  ,

The last is extremely important as it determines carrier collection efficiency and serves as a measure of the potential of InAsxSbyBi1-x-y to serve as a detector material Radiation Monitoring Devices (RMD), Inc. will address this problem via a dual approach that will passivate defects states present both in the bulk of InAsxSbyBi1-x-y and at the surface. Bulk alloy defects will be passivated using hydrogenation. Surface defect passivation is achieved via a unique proprietary two-step surface treatment.

Key to that structure determination was a technique denoted as dynamic nu- clear polarization (DNP) with magic angle spinning (MAS). While Cryo EM, scanning tunneling electron micros- copy (STEM) and other methods provided useful information, recent advances in MAS-NMR methods provided essential restraints and additional crucial information. Hence, developing transformational advances for ssNMR is crucial for both structural biology and biomedical research in general, for progress in curing Alzheimer’s Dis- ease and cancer, and for providing regio-specific drug binding information enabling detailing of the mechanism of action for effective drugs. MAS-DNP systems thus far have all required specialized wide-bore (WB) magnets largely because known de- signs of waveguides compatible with THz transmission and the various relevant issues cannot be made small enough to work in probes for use in standard-bore (SB, also called narrow-bore, NB) magnets. The specialized WB magnets and the required corrugated THz waveguides constitute a large portion of the high cost for MAS- DNP, which has put it out of reach to all but a few premiere laboratories. The Phase-I of this effort demonstrated what we believe can fairly be described as the most significant advance in waveguides for the 40-1500 GHz range in half a century – since the invention of corrugated waveguides. Their attenuation is two orders of mag- nitude below that of prior small waveguides at 400 GHz and comparable to that of the very expensive corrugated waveguides where the diameter is tightly constrained. Manufacturing costs are expected to be well over an order of magnitude below those of corrugated waveguides, and they can readily be made at diameters small enough to make MAS-DNP probes practical in existing NB high-field magnets. This proposed Phase II effort continues the development of our revolutionary broad-band Laminate-Lined Wave- Guides (LLWGs) and tapered transitions, for use over the 40-1500 GHz range, as needed for NMR at 1.5-55 T. It is expected that this advance, in combination with several other technological advances being pursued in other projects, will enable DNP to be added to existing ssNMR high-field systems without the requirement of either a specialized magnet or a gyrotron. This Phase-II effort further proposes to demonstrate a 500 MHz NB HXY MAS- DNP probe operating below 50 K utilizing LLWGs. The LLWG developments will also have major applications in ultra-broadband 6G communications equipment, next-gen satellite communications, astrophysics, and THz med-ical imaging methods.",  ,,,,FRANCIS D DOTY,,8037886497,fddoty@dotynmr.com,,  ,

Until recently, the environment was benign and poorly coordinated services were adequate, for military and commercial users.  Current events make it clear: the electronic warfare (EW) fight is on, and the United States (U.S.) is ill-prepared to win.  The lack of understanding of SATCOM vulnerabilities will increase the odds of the U.S. being significantly challenged during combat operations in an Anti-Access Area Denial (A2AD) environment.  Likewise for civilian and commercial users, we have seen with Russian EW attacks in Ukraine, that the battlefield is not limited to military operations and commercial television providers were targeted and infrastructure items like windmills were damaged. In this document, Alesia Engineering LLC proposes the development of a SATCOM Survivability Analysis Toolkit under project SHELL GAME to identify and quantify all impacts that have the potential to degrade, deny, intercept, or geolocate activity on current or future SATCOM links across any physical domain (land, air, sea, space) to support defensive, offensive, and wargaming purposes.  SHELL GAME will develop a suite of analytical tools to develop a deep understanding of the EW perspective for the SATCOM environment, thus enabling users to develop robust plans in the face of demanding requirements and resource constraints.  This toolkit will ingest and sanitize heterogeneous data, support complex queries (e.g., geolocation), reduce analysis effort, and speed timelines.  SHELL GAME will enable the U.S. to prepare the SATCOM battle-space, to practice in simulated contested environments (e.g., war-game) and if necessary, “fight” SATCOM at the speed of battle.",Carolyn  Sheaff,,(315) 330-7147,Carolyn.Sheaff@us.af.mil,Leeha  Wood,,(719) 581-2131,lwood@alesia-eng.com,,  ,

Quantum computing has risen to prominence as a key use for cryogenic wiring, given its profound national security implications and potential for fundamental transformation of industries ranging from logistics and agriculture to medicine and climate change. The quantum future will require a new supply chain to help lift quantum technologies out of laboratories and into scaled commercial use. US leadership in this supply chain is critical to maintaining our place as a global technology leader. While some quantum technologies are obviously complex, such as sub-Kelvin cryogenic systems or qubits, even seemingly straightforward elements of a quantum system, such as wiring, are subject to rigorous technical requirements and a global supply pinch. The wires used in superconducting systems are typically a major factor in total system cost and an obstacle to scaling up system performance. Today, RF wires are commercially sourced from just a few international suppliers such as CoaxCo (Japan), CryoCoax/Intelliconnect (UK), Delft Circuits (Netherlands), or a handful of Chinese companies. Semi-rigid superconducting coax cables have been relied on as the backbone of low-temperature quantum systems for decades, with benefits including reliability, a large number of compatible components, and good RF qualities. However, semi-rigid coax cables have a large physical footprint, large thermal load, and high stiffness, limiting how many wires can fit in a cryogenic system. Deposited metal-on-insulator cables have recently started being manufactured as an alternative. However, these cables still suffer from serious limitations. Their fabrication relies on metal deposition in vacuum which limits wire length, increases manufacturing costs, and dramatically slows production speed. Finally, both semi-rigid coax and metal-on-insulator cables have lower than optimal density, leading to practical limits on the number of qubits that can be installed in commercially available cryogenic systems. They are also exorbitantly expensive -- any individual wire can easily cost $1,000-5,000, depending on technology, meaning that wiring a gate-based quantum computer can cost more than $1M. Moreover, lead times on delivery of these wires are typically at least several months. The novel flexible coaxial cables to be produced as a result of this proposal creates a new type of high-density data cable for superconducting electronics applications which have high density, low attenuation, low crosstalk, low stiffness, low heat load, and can be manufactured efficiently at scale and any length. It builds on the outstanding performance achieved by Maybell and UCSB with small-scale production and leverages established manufacturing technology to scale and economize production.",Joseph N Altepeter,Program Manager,(703) 526-2054,joseph.altepeter@darpa.mil,Johanna  Zultak,,(720) 938-3350,kyle@maybellquantum.com,,  ,

Here we define xGEO as the 4pi steradian volume encompassing the space out to and beyond lunar distances from Earth, and Non-Standard Threat Vectors (NSTVs) as the trajectories of the spacecraft transiting the xGEO domain. This xGEO regime provides a safe haven where threats can hide, reconfigure, and return to Earth with no attribution. Due to the combined gravity of the Earth and Moon, the xGEO domain enables low-cost options for spacecraft to rapidly alter course to unexpectedly threaten terrestrial- and space-based assets. Existing SDA architectures were not designed for xGEO domain awareness resulting in limited capabilities for 24/7/365 custody. Low target signal (due to poor illumination conditions for long periods of time) and vast distances (up to an order of magnitude larger than GEO distance from Earth) limit the ability of observation systems at GEO altitudes and below to detect such objects. Trusted Space, Inc., proposes to perform Modeling and Simulation (M&S) of three Key Enabling Technologies (KETs) for generating actionable information on NSTV threats to: quantify the Technology Readiness Levels of, develop a maturation plan for, and demonstrate each of the KETs. The developed solution will answer the following questions: What object(s) are in the domain? Where are they? Where did they come from (i.e., who put it there and from where)? Where are they going? Our Phase II objective is to design, develop, and demonstrate information generation techniques to observe and deter hostile actions from NSTVs in xGEO. We will also develop and mature methods, algorithms, and processes for: xGEO Concepts of Operations (CONOPs) optimization; low SNR object detection in dense star clutter; and object Initial Orbit Determination (IOD) and tracking (i.e., Orbit Determination (OD)) using a framework that combines the Probabilistic Admissible Region (PAR, for IOD) and the Particle Gaussian Mixture Filter (PGMF, for OD). Trusted Space is an ideal partner to carry out this effort. Our team has completed multiple efforts that qualify us for a Direct-to-Phase-II project. We have developed and matured xGEO M&S capabilities, along with thousands of NSTV models that we can leverage in this effort. Moreover, the algorithms proposed for this effort are uniquely suited for the xGEO regime since they are derived from three-body dynamics. We have extensive experience with operational missions in xGEO and with tasking, scheduling, and CONOPs optimization.

The cell has inner dimensions of 3mm x 3mm x 3mm, with anti-reflection (AR) coatings at 780nm and a bandwidth of 10nm on the glass windows and contains a thermal Rb vapor. The cell structure consists of a glass-silicon-glass structure. The fabrication involves the application of interior and exterior AR coatings to the glass layers, etching of the cell cavity into the 3-mm-thick double-side-polished silicon wafer, and anodic bonding and filling with Rb vapor in a vacuum bonding and filling system. A large fraction of the project is devoted to the actual fabrication effort, which will leverage Rydberg Technologies’ experience in vapor cell fabrication. The fabrication effort includes the identification of materials with low helium permeability, as well as refining the detailed cell fabrication process. The metric of success for the fabrication component of this Phase-I project resides in meeting the specifications for the AR coatings of the cell, for rubidium vapor content, and for the absence of collisional line broadening. A reflectivity of less than about 0.1% over the 10nm bandwidth of the coating, centered at 780nm is targeted. Reflection measurements will be employed to characterize coating performance versus wavelength. Further, absorption spectroscopy on the Rb D2 line will be employed to verify the presence of Rb vapor in thermal equilibrium within the cell. The desired metric is an absorption coefficient of 1 to 2cm-1 at a temperature of 50C on the Rb-85 F=3 hyperfine component of the D2 line. The observation of saturated hyperfine lines of the 5P3/2 state with a width in the sub-10MHz range in saturated spectra will demonstrate the absence of line broadening due to unwanted trace gases, on an approximately 1MHz scale.

DCS is caused by intravascular or extravascular bubbles as a result of tissue supersaturation in inert gases during decompression, with symptoms varying in severity from skin manifestations to excruciating pain, paralysis and death. The risk of DCS is mitigated through probabilistic decompression models. These effectively limit the supersaturation rate by slowing the ascent of the diver (decompression) but cannot personalize decompression schedules to individual diver physiology. Detection of microbubbles in real time during diving could potentially provide the information needed to personalize decompression schedules and lower individual DCS risk. Clearsens Inc. is a start-up company that aims to translate capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) technology to marketplace for novel ultrasound applications. The company licensed from NC State University a technology that simplifies the manufacturing process and enables highly efficient, wideband, and small form factor CMUT arrays. Our goal is to tailor the patented technology to this Navy need. Our findings in Phase I Base show that the technology is well suited to make a low-power, wearable and pressure-compatible ultrasound imaging system while having the ability to implement both traditional (B-mode/Doppler) imaging and microbubble-specific imaging schemes developed in the context of clinical contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). In Phase I, we verified our hypothesis that the voltages necessary to achieve similar acoustic output would decrease with depth, in both simulations and experiments.Ā Pressure tests with the help of our academic partners demonstrated that the technology can operate reliably at a pressure corresponding to 90 meters depth. We also acquired both B-mode and microbubble-specific images on a flow tissue-mimicking material using a CMUT array connected to a desktop research ultrasonic imaging system, demonstrating multiplexed imaging capability. In Phase II, we propose to manufacture the fully-packaged wearable prototype (final wideband CMUT array packaged with electronics as a wearable capable of multiplexed imaging on various anatomical locations) to be tested and optimized in human chamber dive experiments for decompression stress quantification. We will continue to work with the same established team of experts in microbubble ultrasonic physics and detection, ultra-wideband CMUT design and fabrication, low-power ultrasound electronic interfacing, and diving and hyperbaric medicine, to achieve our goals.",Sandra N Chapman,TPOC,2026316055,sandra.e.chapman2.civ@us.navy.mil,Feysel Yalcin  Yamaner,,9196001271,yalcin@clearsens.com,North Carolina State University,Sherrie  Settle,9195154323

On April 13, 2022, the Cybersecurity, and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Department of Energy (DOE), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and National Security Agency (NSA) issued a rare joint alert that Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors had gained full system access to multiple industrial control systems including Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and IoT devices with the goal of disabling US energy infrastructure. In August 2019 Microsoft reported that hackers working for the Russian government were using printers, video decoders, and other IoT devices as a beachhead to penetrate targeted computer networks. In May 2019, the Mirai botnet was found using a total of 13 different exploits to target routers and other IoT devices. In addition, in August 2018, CNET warned that hacked appliances like air conditioners could bring down a state’s power grid. Vulnerabilities to US critical infrastructure are rooted in the limitations of existing network-protection systems; gateways and firewalls can become compromised. Static firewalls are not device-specific and cannot adapt to changing security states. Some of these challenges are due to the low-cost and high-volume nature of IoT and SCADA devices. High Assurance, NSA endorsed cryptographic products that can provide IoT/SCADA security, can range from $10K per unit to $2M per unit.

CSF leaks occur when the fluid that cushions the brain and spine escapes through ruptures in the surrounding membranes. These leaks are largely caused by TBIs but are also a risk during spinal surgeries, otolaryngological surgeries, lumbar punctures and epidurals and they can also be spontaneous. Distinguishing CSF leaks from other bodily fluids is a well-known problem for ED doctors, EMTs and surgeons as the leaks often present as unilateral rhinorrhea or otorrhea, a clear watery discharge from the nose or ear, or as a mixture with blood and other fluids during spinal surgery. Currently there are no POC diagnostics for CSF leaks and existing methods require patient samples to be sent to third-party laboratories for results that can take 4-7 days. Treatment delays or misdiagnoses significantly increase the risk for life-threatening meningitis, infections and stroke. Patients with CSF rhinorrhea that develop meningitis have also have much higher morbidity rates. Additionally, the weeklong stay not only causes significant distress and discomfort for the patient, but also leads to radically higher healthcare costs. In this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, Chemeleon aims to advance CSF leak diagnosis by developing a novel, inexpensive biosensor that requires no additional equipment or personnel training that can provide results in minutes, enabling medical professionals to make time-sensitive decisions. Chemeleon has already successfully developed a prototype Binding-Induced Nanostructured Dynamic Surface (BINDS) Assay that binds the CSF protein biomarker, beta-2-transferrin (b2TR). This BINDS platform technology integrates nanophotonic reporter surfaces with b2TR-specific aptamer receptors, where binding of b2TR to the sensor surface alters the surface energy producing a vibrant color change that is visible to the naked eye. Proof-of- concept experiments revealed that Chemeleon’s BINDS CSF assay could detect 1 µg/ml of b2TR in 10 minutes, which is higher than the 4-5 µg/ml found in CSF. For Direct-to-Phase II studies, the CSF sensor will be further developed to achieve the high specificity, high sensitivity and low readout time required for use in clinical and field settings. Chemeleon will focus on (1) optimizing sensor performance to rapidly distinguish CSF from nasal fluid and blood samples, (2) finalizing manufacturing processes for efficient scale-up, and (3) designing and testing a commercial in vitro diagnostic prototype. Chemeleon’s CSF sensor will provide advancements in decision-making for head trauma, spinal and otolaryngological surgical cases and present a modular platform for the development of other healthcare diagnostics.",  ,,,,MIN  HU,,5742292242,min@chemeleon.com,,  ,

More than 60 are found in human RNA of all types: mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, lncRNA, and the others. These modifications are dynamic; their global quantities change in development and during disease progression. They are installed by writer enzymes, read by reader proteins and removed by eraser enzymes, and they have an intrinsic capacity to alter RNA structure and dynamics. They influence translation initiation and termination, translation fidelity, alternative splicing, trafficking between cellular compartments, and regulate RNA degradation. RNA reader, writer and eraser proteins are promising drug targets of high current interest to pharma. Currently available analytical methods either do not report on sequence context or provide sequence information but at the expense of multiplexing capability. Despite these limitations, it is now known that modifications are dynamically tied to phenotypic changes in cancer progression, drug resistance, aging, and viral infection.

The therapeutic products are not pills–they are living cells that are harvested from a patient (or sometimes a cell bank) and are shipped to a pharmaceutical company that modiﬁes the cells and then sends them back to be re- injected into the patient. Logistics plays an outsize role in this process because the samples need to be maintained at ultra-low temperatures throughout the shipping process. Because these samples are personalized to a particular patient, they are not replaceable with something else. If damaged or switched, the outcome will be dire. The state-of-the-art shipment technology today is, a dry shipper at liquid nitrogen temperature with a temperature logger that is physically attached to the dry shipper–but they report the temperature of the shipper, not the sample so if a sample is removed for inspection, this will not be recorded. For regenerative medicine therapies to be successful, it is essential that the end-to-end processes of freezing, storage, and thawing are carried out in strict adherence to precisely deﬁned protocols. Transient warming events and variability in product temperatures throughout shipping and distribution can negatively affect the samples and contribute to poor clinical outcomes. Therefore, it is necessary to validate optimized cold chain practices individually for each sample, to ensure the highest quality therapeutic outcomes. The goal of this fast-track proposal is to develop a functional pilot product that will provide an on-the-sample, end to end temperature log before, during, and after shipping. Software will compare user-deﬁned protocol criteria with the sample temperature record and will provide a go / no-go decision for use of the sample. The speciﬁc aims of the project are: (a) develop the on-sample electronics that records the temperature history of the sample along with timestamps with an accuracy of 2 °C, (b) develop the shipper electronics that needs to operate for 3 days on batteries and record time stamped sample temperatures and transmits that data back to the sample custodian, and (c) develop a cryogenic container that can keep the sample data acquisition active while the samples moving around in the lab, and ﬁnally (d) a quality assurance station the can inform the end user if the sample is viable by checking the sample's temperature record against the criteria set by the protocols for that sample.",  ,,,,HANANEL  DAVIDOWITZ,,6096516119,hd@biotillion.com,,  ,

Although breastfeeding benefits for the mother and the baby are recognized worldwide, many mothers are unable to attain their breastfeeding targets due to common discontinuance problems. The proposed solution may increase breastfeeding rates by supporting mothers who are breastfeeding or breast pumping, providing them with resources to sustain breastfeeding. Access to valuable information on the volume of breastmilk expressed could enable mothers to carefully monitor their milk production. At the same time, it may allow the prediction of clogged milk ducts, avoiding serious complications such as breast engorgement or lactational mastitis that can be avoided with early intervention. This intervention could prevent not only early discontinuance in breastfeeding but also promote increased health for mothers by reducing the risks of disease. The monitor may also impact babies’ health since breastfeeding is recommended to achieve optimal growth and development. Further, the proposed monitor may provide the scientific community with data to enable research into different aspects of mothers’ health, for example, determining the reasons for the formation of mastitis._x000D_

The environment in this definition includes the natural environment, man-made chemicals and structures that often pollute the natural environment, and our social interactions and lifestyle choices. Because toxic environments are linked directly to human health and disease, a critical need exists to educate the American population on this relationship to allow us to make informed choices about the amount of risk we are willing to take. Stated differently, to improve public health we need to improve environmental health literacy (EHL), the goal of RFA-ES-21-008 (Innovative Approaches for Improving Environmental Health Literacy). The RFA requests collaborations between small businesses and environmental scientists “to develop novel tools, activities, or materials to build EHL”. In response, Nzumbe Inc. has partnered with media experts (SquishyMedia) environmental and education scientists at Oregon Health & Science University, Oregon State University and local undergraduate institutions to submit this proposal. Our strategy is to use epigenetic science as an education bridge to improve EHL because the basics of this science are relatively easy to understand and the epigenome responds to environmental exposures in ways that can improve or worsen health. To accomplish this goal, our SBIR Phase I and now our Phase II application focuses on developing two “experiential” educational tools. The first tool, delivers interactive learning modules in an online software application that utilizes “gamification” principles to teach users how the environment impacts our epigenome and health as a consequence. Gamification offers a variety of benefits associated with learning outcomes, including enhancing user-engagement, learning, and knowledge retention. Our software application will include the “EpiMon” app, a stylized interactive game that will utilize the epigenetic principles that the student has learned and apply them to fictional creatures (EpiMon) in a fictional world. The second tool, is an educational laboratory kit that will emphasize and tie in principles taught with the software product. The lab kit utilizes a simple and safe model organism, Neurospora crassa, to demonstrate basic epigenetic principles and how environmental exposures can influence the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. While the kit will contain control experiments to demonstrate these principles, it will also offer the students the ability to experiment with growth conditions to determine their impact on epigenetic gene regulation. Unlike most laboratory kits in the marketplace where the experimental outcome is pre-determined, the experiential approach of our kit puts the keys in the hands of the student. Results will be reported to an accompanying software application module where students can compare their results with classmates and other schools to identify exposures with epigenetic activity. Successful completion of the proposed work will enable us to extend these tools to public school students and the interactive software to the lay public and public health professionals at little to no cost.",  ,,,,MICHAEL  ROUNTREE,,7208832041,mike.rountree@nzumbeinc.com,,  ,

Botulinum neurotoxin serotype A1 (BoNT/A1) has become an important therapeutic tool for multiple indications,
despite being the most toxic protein known to science. Although serious Adverse Events (AEs) are rare, their
importance is recognized by the Black Box warning included in the labeling for all FDA-approved BoNT/A1
products. During a recent 3-year period FDA received 13,087 AE reports specifically described as “overdose”,
primarily associated with therapeutic indications. involving the treatment of large muscle groups (eg post-stroke
spasticity, cerebral palsy and cervical dystonia). No treatment is available for BoNT/A1-associated iatrogenic
AEs other than supportive care. The only available botulism therapeutic is an equine-derived antitoxin (BAT,
Emergent Biosolutions) that cannot access the intraneuronal toxin protease responsible for iatrogenic symptoms,
and is therefore of little use in treating AEs associated with BoNT/A1 overdose and off-target actions. We have
developed a post-symptomatic antidote to BoNT/A1 intoxication with an intraneuronal mechanism of action,
designated B8C1ad. B8C1ad is produced by genetically fusing a single domain antibody (sdAb, B8) to a
recombinant atoxic derivative of BoNT/C1 (C1ad for atoxic derivative) that acts as a molecular vehicle to deliver
the B8 antibody to the neuronal cytoplasm where the BoNT/A1 toxic protease resides. The B8 antibody was
selected from a camelid VHH library for its potent inhibition of the BoNT/A1 protease. B8C1ad has been
demonstrated to effectively rescue animals with systemic BoNT/A1 intoxication at times post-intoxication when
conventional antibodies are ineffective, because they cannot access the intra-neuronal BoNT/A1 LC protease.
The safety and effectiveness of B8C1ad to reverse BoNT/A1 intoxication symptoms and rescue animals has
been published in three species, including non-human primates. We here propose establishing a model for
BoNT/A1 overdose via intramuscular administration of supratherapeutic doses, and developing B8C1ad as an
Orphan Drug to treat off-target iatrogenic AEs associated with the clinical use of BoNT/A1 pharmaceutical
products. Successful completion of the proposed studies will support assembly of a target product profile for
B8C1ad, which will be shared with FDA to request a Type C meeting for guidance on the regulatory pathway for
B8C1ad approval as an Orphan Drug to treat iatrogenic overdose associated with BoNT/A1 pharmaceuticals.",  ,,,,PHILIP A BAND,,(973) 342-4899,pband@cytodel.com,,  ,

Many of these deaths can be traced to a disconnect in the flow of information: the wrong medication goes to a patient, a surgical instrument is not properly sanitized, etc. These errors could be prevented with a tag that is used to verify the identity and status of an object at point of delivery.

Compound semiconductors with a wide bandgap are needed for high power devices in electric vehicles (EVs), high frequency components in 5G electronics, and energy-efficient displays. The compound semiconductor market, valued at $36+ billion in 2022, has increased recently with growing consumer demand for EVs.The annual growth rate of silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors, the most prominent devices, is estimated at over 20%. Despite the wide-scale production of these components in an industry that expects near perfection in manufacturing, the current yield of power electronic components is less than 50%. Poor yield results largely from an inability to adequately inspect substrates and epitaxial wafers used for power electronics. Instead, the industry currently relies on inspection tools with poor defect selectivity or destructive methods that can only provide statistical information about the defects in a wafer batch. To increase wafer yield, the team will develop a new type of optical inspection tool for selectively measuring defects in every wafer. If successful, this novel inspection technology will enable the industry to help drive down costs and increase performance of energy-efficient power electronics._x000D_
_x000D_
The intellectual merit of this project is the novel way in which technology developed for use in fundamental science is being applied to rapid semiconductor inspection. The proposed method, called ultrafast imaging, uses the nonlinear optical response of a semiconductor induced by an ultrafast laser to isolate defects that measurably impact the electronic structure of the semiconductor. Though the semiconductor industry has typically focused on measuring morphology to find defects, measurement of compound semiconductors requires a tool that is sensitive to the electronic structure. This project will validate ultrafast imaging through benchmark testing against industry standards and develop an easy-to-use device for getting this technology into the hands of manufacturers. Partner manufacturing and inspection companies will provide inspection data and corresponding wafers, allowing correlation of ultrafast imaging defect measurements with data provided by other industry tools. Additionally, the team will develop and demonstrate an easy-to-use commercial product for user facilities and industrial research and development facilities, another essential step in the development of a high-throughput inspection tool. This benchtop product will not only improve current semiconductor technologies but will also be useful for scientists to characterize the next generation of semiconductors._x000D_

Covira Surgical, Inc. is developing CS-0003, a first-in-class, orally administered non-antibiotic therapy
for preventing infections in patients undergoing gastrointestinal (GI) surgeries.
Despite improved surgical procedures, broad use of antibiotics, mandated asepsis measures, and enhanced
recovery programs, post-surgical infections remain a clear and present danger to patients. Surgical site infections
(SSIs) are a major cause of morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, increased healthcare expenditures, and
mortality for the approximately four million Americans who undergo inpatient GI surgery annually.
While SSIs can result from direct intraoperative contamination of the surgical site, emerging evidence suggests
that many, if not most SSIs (wound infections, organ space infections, anastomotic leaks) may originate from
the patient’s own microbiota. Common pathogens causing such complications (i.e., Enterococcus faecalis,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa) may be present in the gut before surgery. It is estimated that 50% or more of the
pathogens causing SSIs are now resistant to antibiotics chosen for prophylaxis.
CS-0003 prevents SSI by maintaining the health-promoting effects of the native gut microbiota while suppressing
the virulence of the proliferating pathobiota. CS-0003 directly suppresses bacterial virulence without affecting
bacterial growth: it provides microbes with a readily available source of phosphate while providing a physical
shield against bacteria from adhering to and invading the epithelial surface. CS-0003 is intended for use
immediately before and after surgery. Rodent studies show that CS-0003 prevents SSI against multiple human
pathogens and across various surgical models relevant to the human condition.
The overall objective of this Fast-Track STTR is to advance the preclinical and clinical development of
CS-0003 as an adjunctive measure to prevent SSIs. In Phase I, we will demonstrate CS-0003 efficacy in a
large animal model. In Phase II, we will develop methods for large-scale CS-0003 production and
then perform comprehensive preclinical testing. Successful completion of the project will provide the data
required for IND submission.",  ,,,,JOHN C ALVERDY,,(773) 702-4876,jalverdy@surgery.bsd.uchicago.edu,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,  ,

Along with reading, developing mathematical proficiency is arguably one of the most important skills for young children to acquire, particularly with the growing importance of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) in the world today. Yet standardized test scores in math remain alarmingly low, with just 40% of US fourth grade students performing at grade level. A considerable body of research now shows that these gaps often appear before a child first enters kindergarten. Strong parental engagement in a child's mathematics learning is often cited as a key indicator of future academic success, but ways to bring about this engagement remain elusive. Grounded both in computational social science and constructivist models of learning, this project aims to develop a scaleable means of targeting parental engagement and promoting positive math learning experiences for families, goals which are fundamentally aligned with NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and advance national welfare, and which could have significant social and economic impact for years to come. _x000D_

This project will introduce several innovations, particularly in the areas of artificial intelligence and data modeling. A mobile learning application will be developed that provides users with a range of on- and off-screen math activities for parent and child to engage in together. Data will be collected from short surveys repeated at regular intervals and these will be collated together with information provided by the app (learning data, time-on-task, etc.). Deep learning approaches will be leveraged to explore relationships between content, engagement, and learning measures and to suggest follow-on activities predicted to improve these outcomes. While the data set will be limited during Phase I research, the technology will be able to identify an increasing number of connections as participation becomes more and more robust over time.

While the content we propose for VenomSquad is unique, the underlying technology and principles of multimedia design for learning are generalizable to other content areas.  VenomSquad has three innovative features: (1)Technical advancements in collaborative mobile AR. The creation of VenomSquad will require new technical advancements (addressing bandwidth, latency, loss of connection) to ensure a high level of collaboration for the student teams using AR. (2)Multiplayer design engine. The proprietary design engine powering the digital science journal enables collaborative behaviors like communication and sharing resources between students with different information based on their roles, while maintaining common ground within the group.

Wearable pulse oximetry sensors are among the most ubiquitous medical technologies used in healthcare.
Clinicians rely on pulse oximeters to monitor patient health during disease states and medical procedures.
However, numerous studies have shown this technology to be racially biased; hypoxemia is three times more
likely to go undetected in patients with dark skin compared to those with light skin. This technological deficit
disproportionately impacts people of color in the United States and contributes to minority healthcare disparities.
The FDA has since issued a safety warning about using pulse oximetry for minority populations. Low blood oxygen
levels can signify serious respiratory illness in a patient and healthcare workers rely on pulse oximeters to
determine what type of care a patient needs. False negative hypoxemia diagnosis can have detrimental
consequences for patient care including increased rates of mortality and organ dysfunction. The widespread and
impactful use of these devices highlights a critical need for innovative technology that improves healthcare equity
and mitigates racial bias in pulse oximetry. Despite well-documented racial biases, a 2022 survey of pulse
oximeter technology found no manufacturers attempting to incorporate novel technology that accounts for
differences in skin tone. The goal of this Phase I project is to develop novel sensor technology for non-invasively
measuring blood oxygen saturation that accounts for the patient’s skin pigment and delivers reliably accurate
oxygen saturation measurements for persons of all skin colors. Our proposed technology incorporates two
sensing modules: a novel skin pigment colorimetry sensor for classifying patient skin tone and an optical
transducer for measuring blood oxygen saturation via the photoplethysmography technique. We will develop a
machine learning algorithm to model and compensate for the effects of skin tone on blood oxygen saturation
measurements. These innovations in technology development and biological signal processing will meet a critical

Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl compounds (PFASs) represent a class of emerging environmental
contaminants, resulting from their use in fire suppressants, and presence in landfill leachates and wastewater
treatment plant effluent and solids. The presence of PFAS in the environment is a serious concern since
they have exhibited hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, thyroid damage, fetal and developmental toxicity, and
endocrine disruption. As we begin to understand more about their application and spread and how toxic
they can be, it is important and urgent to have a rapid and inexpensive way to detect PFAS. Multiple
methods, including LC-MS/MS, GC-MS and ion mobility exist for sensitive and selective detection of
PFAS in a variety of modalities. Unfortunately, these methods suffer from limited sample throughput, high
detection limits, high operational costs, complex operation, and require knowledge of the specific PFAS
chemical structure making them unsuitable for quantifying total PFASs. Several other detection techniques
are emerging but are not yet themselves able to reliably determine total PFASs in samples. We seek to
enable faster and lower-cost, but still reliable and robust, detection and quantification of total PFASs. This
project will chart as-yet unexplored territory in develop an advanced solid-state nanopore chip to meet these
urgent and comprehensive needs. Our nanopore instrument features a single-molecule precision and has
been used to detect DNA, RNA, proteins and small pharmaceuticals at low concentrations from different
forms of samples (liquid, solid, etc.). The approach will be enabled by a unique integration of advanced
nanofabrication, high-throughput data collection and reliable data analysis software to improve the overall
PFAS detection capabilities. Nanopore chips with tailored pore characteristics (diameter,
thickness, coating, etc.) will be fabricated, tested and validated and their storage, stability
and reusability will be systematically evaluated. We envision this platform as a first line
of defense against PFAS contamination for individuals and private and public

One million people in the US suffer from continual seizures that are not controlled by medication. The current estimate is that half of these could be treated effectively by surgical resection of the epileptic cortical tissue, and yet the majority of them will not receive the surgery (Engel & Wiebe, 2012). There are 200 Comprehensive Epilepsy Centers in the US that are certified to provide both the epilepsy resection and the multimodal presurgical evaluation (clinical semiology, neuropsychological assessment, EEG, MRI, PET, and intracranial or icEEG). A problem for this evaluation is the software for integrating the multiple imaging and assessment modalities in the presurgical workup to allow confidence in the neurosurgical plan. The localization of the icEEG electrodes is often problematic because of brain shift (movement and deformation of the brain from the preoperative imaging to the postoperative CT used for electrode position imaging). With recent advances in dense array EEG (dEEG) with individual head conductivity models, electrical source imaging can provide noninvasive estimates of the seizure onset zone, which could then guide more focused and effective icEEG probes, and potentially more confident and limited neurosurgical resections. The present SBIR research builds on our extensive experience with icEEG electrode localization, multimodal neuroimage registration, dEEG source imaging, and user interface design to create Sourcerer IC, a software platform optimized for bringing multiple forms of evidence to interpret icEEG measures and improve the localization of the seizure onset zone. The key innovations of this project are: the integration of multimodal neuroimaging data (MRI, dwMRI, fMRI, PET) registered precisely with structural MRI in a DICOM format for export to the neurosurgeon’s neuronavigator software; the capacity for noninvasive dEEG source localization of spikes and seizure onset with individual head conductivity models in preparation for icEEG electrode placement (as validation rather than exploration); the correction of brain shift due to surgical implanting of icEEG electrodes by registering the postoperative CT to the preoperative MRI; and perhaps most importantly, the integration of all components of the presurgical workup within an intuitive and usable software workflow with full quality system regulation and validation following FDA guidelines. Sourcerer IC will build on the many years of experience with Yale’s BioImage Suite, such that physicians and technicians access their components of the workflow through secure web interfaces, and the networked database maintains and integrates all transactions to coordinate computational as well as data resources for efficient completion, review, and implementation of an optimized neurosurgical plan.",  ,,,,PHAN  LUU,,5416534352,phan.luu@bel.company,,  ,

RNG is part of biogas and requires cost- and energy-effective separation from carbon dioxide.The company has developed an additive manufacturing technology that enables the fabrication of high performance membranes to enable lower cost biogas upgrading.These membranes offer energy and system design benefits over more traditional separations technologies for the production of RNG. The membrane printing approach may lead to the production of best-in-class membranes for RNG production and could enable carbon capture and utilization from biogas sources.This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the production of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) comprised of polyether block amide polymer and zif8 zeolite.The proposed method uses electrospray based additive manufacturing to precisely control membrane thickness and zeolite loading, allowing customized membrane properties for biogas upgrading. Furthermore, theadditive manufacturing, or printing, method enables increased loading of the zeolite over conventional casting techniques without the formation of defects that would lessen selectivity.The goals of the project include quantification of the maximum zeolite loading while avoiding loss of selectivity.

The overall goal of this project is to develop a novel therapeutic for the treatment of immune-
mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP). iTTP is an acute, life-threatening disease
that without treatment, leads to a rt90% mortality rate. It is caused by deficiency of a disintegrin
and metalloprotease thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13), which is a protease
that cleaves ultra large aggregates of von Willebrand factor (VWF). Such aggregates of VWF bind
to platelets, resulting in blood clots. Consequently, ADAMTS13 deficiency leads to microthrombus
formation in arterioles and capillaries, and iTTP is characterized by hemolytic anemia,
thrombocytopenia and organ damage, with possible severe cardiac, renal, neurological and
gastrointestinal effects.For iTTP, ADAMTS13 deficiency is caused by autoantibodies specific for this protease.
Current treatments are therefore directed towards reducing the levels of these antibodies by
plasma exchange and the use of general immunosuppressants (corticosteroids, rituximab). In
addition, a bivalent nanobody (caplacizumab) that inhibits VWF-platelet interactions has recently
been approved to treat iTTP. Despite treatment, however, relapses occur in 30-50% iTTP
patients. Further, the treatments can have adverse effects such as abnormal bleeding
(caplacizumab) and/or increased risk of infection due to general immunosuppression. Rituximab
also has a slow onset of action and is used in combination with plasma exchange. Consequently,
there is a need to develop therapies for iTTP that have rapid effects and high specificity for the
causal agent of disease, namely the autoantibodies.This application seeks to address the need for new and improved therapies for iTTP by
generating engineered, antibody-based reagents that specifically and rapidly deplete
ADAMTS13-specific antibodies. Importantly, these depleting agents are highly selective and do
not have general immunosuppressive effects. This first-in-class, novel technology has been
named Seldeg technology (for selective degradation).The Specific aims of the study are:1. To design and express Seldegs to target ADAMTS13-specific antibodies.2. To analyze the stability and binding activity of the Seldegs.The proposed approach could be transformative for the management of iTTP, and also has
relevance to the use of Seldeg-based strategies for multiple other clinical settings where
pathogenic antibodies cause disease.",  ,,,,SUNIL  KANNANGANATSIDHARTHAN,,(404) 693-7174,sunil@asteroerado.com,,  ,

Each year, between 340,000 and 900,000 premature deaths can be linked to air pollution caused by releasing
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), i.e., an estimated 1.8 billion tons of VOCs are emitted to the global
environment each year. Also, some VOCs cause serious adverse health effects even at the trace level
concentration, e.g., cancer, damage to the central nervous and immune system. For example, the EPA has
identified 188 toxic air pollutants known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as
reproductive effects, congenital disabilities, or adverse environmental effects. Existing commercial sensors for
detecting VOCs, such as photoionization detectors, are non-selective. So, they are unsuitable for detecting
unsafe levels of multiple carcinogenic/toxic VOCs simultaneously, e.g., Benzene and Toluene. Also, the current
selective detecting technologies such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (global chromatography
market size rt$15B by 2030) are bulky (~5 lbs.), expensive (~$25K - $100K), sluggish (~ 2 minutes), and requires
a skilled/trained operator. Therefore, Prometheus Technologies is developing a patented sensor platform with
features such as selectivity, low-cost, fast, small form factor monitoring solution that does not require
skilled/trained operators to detect unsafe levels of carcinogenic/toxic VOCs. A significant technological hurdle to
developing a selective VOC sensor is interference from a small subset of background confounders when a
feature-limited single wavelength desorption curve is used for quantification. The goals of this application are 1)
to perform a series of verified physics-based models to generate a sizeable optical sensor dataset at a low cost
that is essential considering the scarcity of data in this field, and 2) to develop a machine learning model based
on the dataset in step (1) for detecting unsafe levels of target compounds with background confounders. This
work is necessary to advance our patented selective and miniaturized VOC optical sensor.",  ,,,,HAMED  ATTARIANI,,(937) 775-8320,hamed.attariani@wright.edu,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,  ,

Their designs are shared to stakeholders and team members with limited context and collaboration.

However, despite recent advances in seismic imaging and tomography this is still very much an open problem and one that can lead the use of large factors of safety and can result in substantial additional project costs and delays as geophysical features may be unexpectedly revealed during later phases of construction. Offshore conditions in ports and shipyards further compound the problem, and very few options exist for practical yet accurate geotechnical site assessment. However, recent advances now offer several ways in which modern machine learning techniques can be applied to provide an advanced seismic imaging and tomography capability, these include:  Recent advances in physics-informed neural network (PINN) 3-D subsurface map generation from seismic geophone data provides an approach that is robust to noise from secondary reflections, and has the potential to overcome many of the traditional of current linearization-based techniques.  The second way that machine learning may be applied to this problem, is in image enhancement. In this way machine learning can be paired with traditional image reconstruction techniques but used in a capacity similar to that of super resolution to provide additional fidelity or robustness to noise is in ways that standard linearization algorithms cannot.  Finally, modern machine learning techniques can be utilized to identify and provide semantic understanding of 3-D volumetric data. For example, identification of void locations and or soil types can be automatically mapped and associated with individual of voxels within a 3-D image representation of the reconstructed soil medium During Phase I, we will assess the feasibility of each of two of the aforementioned techniques, namely tomographic reconstruction and image interpretation (1 and 3, respectively). We’ll perform optimization and automatically assign semantic labeling to identify voids, anomalies and geophysical features to tomographic maps during the Phase I Option. During Phase II, we would propose to also include 3D tomographic image enhancement, however, we would propose to focus on the core challenges (1, 3) during Phase I. In this proposal, we will briefly present the fundamental equations, architectures, and technical approach that we will propose to undertake to implement them as means of quickly determining the feasibility of the approach. We will also identify areas where additional data or effort may be required, and will look to provide a solid foundation for a successful Phase II effort, where data will be gathered in the field under conditions similar to those required by the Navy and used to calibrate the models developed and trained prior. Validation examples will include localization and dimensions of timber-constructed relieving structures, piles, structural details, patterns, and missing elements.",Russel N Batman,Engineer,(202) 433-5327,john.r.batman.civ@us.navy.mil,Peter  Vonk,,(605) 593-5500,vonk@synthetik-technologies.com,,  ,

High Power Microwave (HPM) weapons provide a long-range, non-lethal method of neutralizing enemy electronic systems that use that common radar and military communication frequencies. These HPM transmitters include an HPM source, pulsed power equipment, and, crucially, an antenna to transfer the energy into a free-space wave and deliver it to the target. DTI proposes to develop two distinct, but synergistic antennas in this effort: one antenna will be a conformal phase array with a gain of 40 dBi, rated at 1 GW, and phase steerable in both azimuth and elevation greater than +20 degrees; a second larger single antenna will be developed and will have a wide bandwidth (8 to 18 GHz) and high gain of 40 dBi installed on a two-axis mount capable of sweeping -15° through 90° elevation and a full 360° in azimuth with appropriate drive motors. Our approach reduces RF power density to below the breakdown strength of ambient air and avoids the losses and dispersion of waveguides operating over multi-octaves. These incorporated features ensure that the antennas will operate at gigawatt power levels without electrical breakdown, and provide the necessary gain over a wide bandwidth to produce a highly focused beam that optimally delivers energy to the target. In Phase I, DTI will develop the designs for a phased array and reflector integrated antenna and fabricate proof of concept prototypes. This will enable a detailed evaluation of the mechanical designs, and basic real-world investigation of the RF performance of the array.",Sterling  Beeson,,(505) 853-6533,sterling.beeson@us.af.mil,David  Cope,,(781) 275-9444,cope@divtecs.com,,  ,

Recent conflicts have confirmed that rival powers are investing in artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous platforms and weapons, denial of GPS, and alternatives to GPS for their own forces. In response, the 2030 Strategy calls for several transformational capabilities to be driven by scientific and engineering advances. These capabilities will include Global Persistent Awareness, Resilient Information Sharing, and Rapid Effective Decision Making that in turn require advancements in sensing, self-contained positioning and navigation, AI, and autonomous systems among other technologies. Where possible the Air Force will leverage commercial investment in these technologies, which greatly exceeds the resources of the Defense Department.  Compound Eye is a leading commercial developer of 3D sensing and perception technology for autonomous vehicles and other robots. The company’s VIDAS technology (“Visual Inertial Distributed Aperture System”) uses off-the-shelf, automotive-grade cameras, inertial sensors, and AI to build a dense 3D representation of the world around a vehicle in real time. This information is critical for an autonomous system to avoid static and dynamic obstacles and can enable self-contained positioning, mitigating or eliminating the need for external positioning systems like GPS.  VIDAS has drawn interest from the DoD because it delivers the same information as active sensors such as lidar and radar for a fraction of the size, weight, power, and cost, all with zero signature. However, the current commercial version of VIDAS relies in part on wide baseline stereo sensing, which is not suitable for small unmanned platforms. For these applications AFRL (AFRL/RWWI) has challenged Compound Eye to develop a version of VIDAS that requires only a single camera.  The primary objectives of the proposed effort are:  1. Verify experimentally that monocular depth from optic flow and semantic cues can provide robust, accurate, real-time depth measurements   2.

Radiative cooling using a high-emissivity coating proves to be a very effective way to reduce high surface temperature in orbital conditions where atmosphere is absent. However, the coating would continue to undesirably cool the surface at low temperatures, worsening the temperature swing. To address this challenge, various smart radiation devices are under development to realize variable emissivity based on the temperature of radiating surfaces. However, these devices require temperature sensors, control circuits, and additional electrical power input. In this STTR program, ACT and the UC Berkeley propose to develop a space temperature-adaptive radiative coating that automatically senses the temperature and switches emissivity from a high value at high temperatures to a low value at low temperatures.

This program aims to take advantage of the growing cadre of private launch providers (Masten Space, SpaceX, Blue Origin, etc.), many of which are funded by venture capital, to achieve these goals. One of the challenges that will be faced during this program is the development of technology that will allow rocket cargo to land on unfinished, irregular surfaces unlike those typically used by the private launch companies mentioned previously. In such cases, it is important to understand the mechanism of interaction between the plume and the various types of landing surfaces that it might encounter. To this end, the overall aim of the proposed effort will be to develop diagnostic tools that are capable of measuring velocity and/or identifying structures involved in plume-ground interactions. These tools will provide measurement data that can be used for validating and improving existing numerical models. Under the proposed Phase I effort, our team will initiate progress towards the overall goal by using a subscale reacting rocket model. The exhaust plume from this model will be visualized using appropriate high-speed imaging techniques to understand the temporal evolution of flow structures. In future phases, this test setup will be appropriately modified to include the effects of a planar surface of appropriate quality to recreate realistic landing scenarios that might be encountered by rocket-based cargo vehicles that support the TacRL program. These modifications will allow for the better characterization of the plume-ground interaction mechanism by studying the temporal evolution of flow structures in the plume as they interact with the ground plane and evolve thereafter.

Chip-scale atomic clocks do not meet tactical grade requirements and require 2 to 3 orders of magnitude improvement on their frequency sensitivity to thermal perturbations. One approach consists in replacing the atomic vapor (Rb, Cs, Ca, Sr, Yb) with molecular vapor (I2, COS, C2H2, CO) because molecules do not condensate at temperatures beyond 130˚C. With that in mind, miniature clocks with lower frequency drift rates require the development of heaters and thermal probes that do not generate residual magnetic fields at that target operating temperature.   In this Phase I effort, EngeniusMicro will transfer the technology developed by John Kitching’s group at NIST. The technology consists of an atomic vapor cell fabricated by a 2-step anodic process which removes the Rb pill from the final cell, allowing for a more stable chemical environment and a much smaller footprint. The atomic vapor cell is sandwiched by Kapton tethers which mechanically support and thermally isolate the cell from the environment. The complete physics package is 1cm by 1cm and the cell is electrically connected via planar electrical feedthroughs.  Several aspects of this technology will be improved upon including the design of the heaters and the choice of materials to enable RTDs with sub-1mK temperature sensitivity. If the prototyping effort is successful in Phases I & II, we will transfer the fabrication process flow to Dynetics Leidos for mid-volume fabrication in a single-user facility that can handle TS level security clearance.  ",Sean  Krzyzewski,,(505) 846-2925,Sean.Krzyzewski.1@spaceforce.mil,Benoit  Hamelin,,(678) 428-1843,benoit.hamelin@engeniusmicro.com,,  ,

Pilots and Naval Flight Officers of the E-2C/D Hawkeye routinely fly four-to-six-hour missions (which may double if the planes are made refuelable) without getting out of their seats. To alleviate the symptoms of extended-duration seating experienced by E-2 crews, ATA is developing the Continuous Wave Seat Cushion (CWC). By using an array of individually sealed foam cells that can be independently collapsed by vacuum, the CWC technology improves blood circulation for the seated occupant by relieving excessive pressure points in a way that is similar to shifting the body position or fidgeting, but without the occupant having to move. Through gradual collapse and reinflation of a pattern of cells, the occupant support surface is continually varied—allowing circulation to be restored periodically over the entire seated area. The active cushion allows the operator or pilot to sit for a greatly extended time period without experiencing numbness, excessive pressure, or muscle ache, thus allowing them to be more alert and focused on their assignment. CWC operation is achieved through a small vacuum pump and rotary valve system that results in very low power consumption and quiet operation, and the foam CWC cells reinflate on their own after vacuum is removed. By contrast, active systems that use inflated bladders require significant power to inflate and deflate the bladders, are noisy, and are unable to support the occupant without power. The proposed effort is intended to develop necessary documentation and otherwise prepare for and support the Navy’s execution of a flight demonstration of prototype CWC seat cushion units. The proposed work encompasses developing advanced prototype seat cushion units, preparing an installation data package (IDP) for flight testing of the prototype units, supporting the flight test program, reporting on the results of the flight test program, and performing a feasibility study to evaluate adaptation of the technology to another aircraft platform.",William C Glass,TPOC,(301) 342-8450,william.c.glass.civ@us.navy.mil,Gordon  Pfeiffer,,(858) 480-2114,gordon.pfeiffer@ata-e.com,,  ,

It can greatly protect satellite and aircraft electro-optical and infrared (EO-IR) sensors from being destroyed by lasers.  Under a normal condition with no laser threats, the P-LPD is highly transparent with >70% optical transmittance to allow a normal detection and tracking operation of EO-IR sensors.  Once a powerful laser with unknown wavelength presents from an emitter such as a laser guided weapon, the P-LPD locally rejects the incoming laser beam over a broad spectral bandwidth.  The rejected laser energy is deflected to exit from the P-LPD edge into the direction that can’t be detected or tracked by the enemy EO-IR sensor.  Additionally, the P-LPD can be made into a tile-like format which can be applied as a coating to the satellite and aircraft to make them stealthy.  Since the P-LPD coating does not retro-reflect laser light, it provides a stealthier capability against those laser-guided weapons and/or sensors.   In Phase I, a feasibility study will be performed to evaluate the P-LPD designs emphasizing on low cost and space qualification with an in-depth analysis and lab experiment to down-select for Phase II development (reaching TRL 3).  Phase II is to develop space qualified P-LPD prototypes via VO2 material synthesis, plastic WG fabrication, and P-LPD integration as well as lab qualification to reach TRL 6.",Jonathan  Allison,,(505) 853-3080,jonathan.allison.1@spaceforce.mil,Le  Li,,(845) 897-0138,leli@kentoptronics.com,,  ,

MagiQ Technologies has more than 10 years of development expertise in this area.  We have executed on 4 Phase II SBIRs in directly related topics.  We have also executed on two RIF programs to cancel signal both with and without a tapped reference. The use of a referenced canceller provides a great operational advantage in that much more of the received spectrum can actually be utilized for reception. This is mainly because large chunks of received spectrum do not have to be obliterated by notches intended to block unwanted noise from local transmitters.  At the same time the transmitters can continue the important work of relaying critical messages without having to stop to allow the receivers to listen.",McLaina O Mazzone,APM,(619) 524-4519,mclaina.mazzone.civ@us.navy.mil,Mark  Lucas,,(617) 661-8300,mark.lucas@magiqtech.com,,  ,

AtF is a passive, miniature, low-cost component technology that can simply be placed after the antenna that automatically and dynamically blocks high power signals and therefore enable radio receivers to continuously operate. Being passive, it does not require any power supply, which is extremely advantageous for size, weight, and power-constrained platforms such as satellites. Unlike traditional fixed/tunable notch filters, active beam nulling, and solid-state limiters, the AtF can automatically sense and track threats, and selectively suppress unwanted electromagnetic interference (EMI) based on its power level, while small signals of interest (below the designated threshold) will pass unaffected. It has fast response in real time (sub-microsecond), without any user input and adaptive algorithms. An AtF can selectively suppress multiple dynamic threats simultaneously that are changing in both power level and frequency, all without affecting signals of interest. The proposed AtFs employ physical properties of thin ferrite films and interaction of pure magnetic spin oscillations with RF/microwave signals. Metamagnetics’ has already developed, fabricated, and tested a series of AtF devices for operating over a wide frequency range from 100 MHz through 20 GHz with power thresholds ranging from -50 dBm to +30 dBm. In this proposed project, Metamagnetics plans to demonstrate prototype space compatible AtF technology. The proposed technology will be adapted to applications in harsh space conditions, including vibrations and mechanical shock. Application of the proposed technology will assure the integrity of satellite radio communication (SATCOM) links, especially those in low-earth orbit (LEO).",Jonathan  Allison,,(505) 853-3080,jonathan.allison.1@spaceforce.mil,Mahima  Shukla,,(781) 562-0756,mshukla@mtmgx.com,,  ,

These include grapple interfaces, power transfer interfaces, fluid transfer interfaces, and hosted payload platforms. Many companies have developed hardware to fill one or more of these missions; however, up to the present no company has developed an interface that is simultaneously both an excellent in-space docking interface and can support large payloads through the vibration of the launch environment. The Docking, Anchoring and Towing Universal Match-plate (DATUM) interface is the solution to allow for a truly universal androgynous interface capable of meeting all requirements for docking and launch lock.  DATUM offers a combination several benefits that no existing interface can currently provide. These advantages include: Androgynous: DATUM is an identical interface for each half, allowing a single design to be mounted and deployed across many systems, ensuring intercompatibility across the ecosystem Capture at a Distance: Altius’ Dual-Mode electropermanent magnet (EPM) gripper provides magnetic attraction force across distances as far as 5 to 10 cm, allowing for safer and more reliable capture CONOPS than traditional docking methods, and pure planar contact is all that is needed to establish a “soft dock” between the two halves No-power Hold: The EPMs and mechanical locks will maintain a holding force even through a power loss event Magnetic Attraction and Repulsion: The centrally mounted EPM module can reverse polarity on command, changing a magnetic attraction force into a magnetic repulsion force to separate the two interface halves when undocking Combined Fluid/Power/Data Transfer: DATUM has provisions for power, data, and fluid transfer all in the same interface, allowing the same universal connector to be used for nearly all payloads, from RF antennas and apertures to propellant storage tanks Self-Alignment Geometry: The geometry of the DATUM structure provides self-alignment while mating, greatly increasing the capture envelope and reliability of a successful docking mission Launch Lock Load Reaction: Datum utilizes secondary mechanical locks which can be set by a manual operator or autonomously driven, allowing the interface to be used as a launch-lock and deployment mechanism for payloads integrated on the ground During Phase I, Altius will perform design trades to refine the conceptual design of the DATUM to become optimized for AFRL’s technical and cost requirements. This will be followed by detailed design of a Phase 1 ground prototype, and the build and test of two DATUM interfaces, including cycle testing and vibration testing.

(Intellisense) proposes to develop a new Toolset for Impedance Modeling of etextile Structures (TIMES) based on a new design that utilizes new software algorithms and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Specifically, the innovation in impedance modeling algorithms will enable TIMES to generate an accurate representation of transmission line impedance based on fundamental math models of generic woven structures serving as ground truth, adjusted for vendor-specific material properties. As a result, this process promises to improve performance in areas such as development, demonstration, validation, and evaluation of a variety of functional textile-based data networks to provide soldiers with enhanced capabilities that increase their ability to quickly understand and react to emerging battlefield situations. Proposed etextile technologies can be rapidly modeled and simulated to verify their appropriateness for high-speed, low-loss data transmission protocols such as USB, Gigabit Ethernet, Serial, SMBus, and I2C without requiring iterative physical experimentation, which directly addresses the Army requirements. In Phase I, Intellisense will determine the technical feasibility to develop new design tools and guidelines for a signal line impedance model to be based on a combination of first principles and empirical data. Proof-of-concept bench-scale data networks will be designed, fabricated and evaluated and at the end of the Phase I effort, Intellisense will deliver a tangible proof-of-concept network demonstration article, conceptual impedance model and design tools, and survey of shielding options to demonstrate the feasibility of TIMES by modeling an existing etextile structure and verifying TIMES-generated simulation results against actual measured results from high-speed data passed through the physical test article. In Phase II, Intellisense plans to make improvements to the conceptual model and design tools using data collected and lessons learned from Phase I testing. Intellisense will then use these tools to develop methods for improving the impedance characteristics of etextile networks. The improved networks will be tested to verify their ability to support high-speed data transmission while maintaining efficiency, size, weight, and power consumption metrics equal to or better than the incumbent wired cabled networks. At the end of Phase II, the finalized and validated impedance model, design tools, and related software will be delivered, along with prototype etextile network systems that have been evaluated for MIL-STD-810 and MIL-STD-461 compliance through a combination of benchtop and electromagnetic interference (EMI) chamber testing prior to delivery to the Government.",Carole A Winterhalter,,(508) 233-5460,carole.a.winterhalter.civ@army.mil,Robert  Stephens,,(310) 320-1827,rstephens@intellisenseinc.com,,  ,

Computational models offer insights to understand the underlying mechanisms of human injury, leading to crucial design improvements of different aircraft equipment. Historically, computational models in this area have consisted of inertial segments of simplified geometry where the segments are connected by joints of varying motion definition. The outputs of these models are related to the kinematics they replicate such as segment displacement, velocities, and accelerations which are similar to test manikins. Recent advancements in computational capabilities such as finite element (FE) methods enable more accurate modeling of human interaction in such complex dynamic loading environments. Traditionally, these FE models have been developed to represent an average male (50th percentile in terms of height and weight). While these models can provide a valuable assessment of the mid-sized adult male, real world aircraft equipment safety evaluations are not limited to 50th percentile occupants and involves occupants of various size, age and gender. In the past, there have been efforts in developing small female occupant models to investigate the automotive crashes. However, there has never been a concerted effort to develop and validate a small female (5th percentile) human body model that can accommodate the evaluation of airworthiness for aircraft safety systems and aircrew flight equipment safety evaluations. Therefore, the overall objective here is to develop and validate a robust, biofidelic, 5th percentile female FE model for testing and evaluation of aircraft safety systems and simulation of injury predictions. In Phase I,  CFD Research will work on (i) developing accurate 5th percentile female human body surface models using medical image data processing and inhouse capabilities, (ii) developing and validating finite element meshes for different local organs against literature data, (iii) integrating the finite element meshes into a single finite element human body model, (iv) preliminary demonstration of the injury biomechanics predictions using the finite element model and (v) articulating the finite element model into different positions using inhouse capabilities. The models will be delivered to the government with a DoD use perpetual license. The Phase II work will involve maturing the preliminary FE model into a well-validated robust model that can be used to study the injury biomechanics under any dynamic loading scenario. This will involve efforts to improve and validate some of the individual local organ models, implement different active and passive musculature states and further validate the full body model for human/cadaver datasets.

Using integrated photonic devices such as fiber coupler, waveguide, modulator, splitter/combiner and micro-ring, the proposed EPPS can generate and process the entangled photons with high efficiency and speed. In phase I effort, we developed theoretical models to study the spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) conversion efficiencies based on both hybrid and ridge waveguide LNOI PIC designs. We have successfully demonstrated an in-situ monitored periodically poling process with small poling periods and large poling gaps. Leveraging other on-going PSI projects, we have also fabricated and characterized the key PIC components for the proposed EPPS chip, including low-loss waveguides, fiber coupler, high extinction splitter/combiner, micro-ring resonator and high-speed modulator. The phase I result paved a solid foundation toward a high-efficiency EPPS PIC chip. In phase II, we will continue the PIC components development focusing on the ridge waveguide designs, and experimentally demonstrate all the key PIC components. We will further refine the periodically poled LNOI (PPLNOI) process with improved accuracy and automation. Through the collaboration with RIT, our subcontractor, who has significant experiences in quantum photonic system testing and characterization, we will demonstrate the entanglement of the SPDC generated photon pair. Lastly, we will perform initial integration and packaging for the EPPS chip based on advanced photonic wire-bonding technology. Based on our pioneer work in TFLNOI PICs development and with our successful experiences in commercialization of SBIR research efforts, PSI is poised to develop, package, qualify and commercialize the proposed EPPS chip for tomorrowrsquo;s quantum communication demands.",NASA SBIR  Support Office,,(301) 937-0888,sbir@reisystems.com,Peng  Yao,,(302) 286-5191,yao@phasesensitiveinc.com,Rochester Institute of Technology,  ,

These can be used for calibration and research when the telescope is unavailable and in testbed laboratories for research. There have been several past attempts at making surrogate sources for laser beacons, and they have been only partially successful. MZA proposes to fabricate a source object whose imagery and wavefront sensor measurements mimic those exhibited in wave-optics simulations (and on-sky data if available). Finite size and elongated shape are key properties of the surrogate objects. The fabrication process will be developed and tested in a laboratory with a camera and wavefront sensor.

To develop the high-fidelity 5th percentile female model, Phase I efforts will utilize a combination of CAD generation, meshing, and morphing techniques.  The proposed solution will leverage and build upon existing anatomy and FE models on hand to accelerate the development of the female FE model.  Zygote currently has CAD developed for the female integumentary system, skeletal system, and organs derived directly from female medical anatomy scans.  The muscular tissue is more difficult to segment from medical imaging data as distinct boundaries for each muscle are often difficult or impossible to recognize.  Thus, the existing CAVEMAN musculature will be morphed into the female form using the female skin and skeletal CAD for guidance.  The morphed soft tissues will then be compared to the female medical imaging data and modified as necessary to align with the soft tissue landmarks.  Upon completion of this process, the high-fidelity female FE model will have distinct meshed parts for all bones, muscles, ligaments, cartilage, organs, and skin tissues within the human body developed from female medical imaging data.  The mesh model will be combined with validated biological materials models and assembled using accurate soft tissue insertions to complete the high-fidelity 5th percentile female model.  The proposed effort will utilize the same techniques applied within the CAVEMAN model to establish parity in the development of the Computational Anthropomorphic Virtual Experiment WOMAN (CAVEWOMAN) model under this SBIR effort.  This will provide a solid foundation moving into Phase II to apply existing repositioning, scaling, and muscle activation methods, resulting in a family of validated, posable, high-fidelity female human body models capable of injury predictions with both active and passive musculature.",Timothy  DeWitt,,(937) 255-2242,timothy.dewitt.2@us.af.mil,Kevin  Lister,,(704) 799-6944,kevin.lister@corvidtec.com,,  ,

Unlike other synchronization solutions, Ditto is designed for ""peer-to-peer"" synchronization where it can directly communicate with other devices even without a network connection. In addition, Ditto automatically manages the complexity of using multiple network transports, like Bluetooth, P2P Wi-Fi, and Local Area Network (LAN), to find the optimal path, connect to other devices, and synchronize any implemented changes in the application. ​​​​Ditto provides a complete software platform to enable nearly any type of computing system to share data in a real-time mesh network.  When network communications are available, Ditto chooses the optimal path of transport, such as Bluetooth or Direct Wi-Fi or LAN to transmit changes to, and from, any other systems. Ditto does not require a central server, and instead operates in a P2P mechanism that creates a data-sharing mesh network, allowing devices to communicate directly with each other.

This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to continue the development of a minimally invasive cryoablation system capable of safely and effectively targeting the gallbladder. Initial testing of the cryoablation system has demonstrated the ability to uniformly generate lethal cryoablation temperatures (less than-20℃) across the gallbladder lumen, leading to durable gallbladder scarring and defunctionalization in porcine animals up to 60 days post-procedure. Key technical objectives of this project are to develop the industrial design of the introducer, cryoablation catheter, and control system for improved clinical usability and manufacturability, to further test and characterize clinical delivery parameters to inform treatment planning, to improve sensor reliability and control system response time to optimize safety profile, and to validate the integrated system in vivo to demonstrate system performance with optimized dosing parameters. The system will be evaluated in an advanced benchtop model gallbladder under a thermal load, ex vivo gallbladder tissues, and an in vivo chronic animal model to optimize and validate the cryoablation catheter and integrated control system.

It is becoming increasingly difficult for organizations to effectively manage all of the cybersecurity tools they utilize. This is due to the growing complexity of network environments, increasingly advanced and frequent attacks, an abundance of information being ingested from cybersecurity tools, and the demand for building correlations between results from various logs and tools. Management of a secure database and its access logs even further complicates risk management, since databases have their own set of cybersecurity challenges that need to be addressed, such as authentication, network and data access controls, data encryption, auditing, vulnerabilities and patches to database software, database compliance, backups, etc. We propose “NLC-ADP” (No/Low-Code – Application Development Platform), an enhancement to an existing no-code or low-code application development platform, tying in AI/ML, database management, and cybersecurity into a single solution and enabling the rapid development of applications for Nuclear Logistics data and systems. Our proposed NLC-ADP solution will ingest and normalize data from databases, cybersecurity tools, local logs, system usage, and system messages and allow for configurations of mitigations, alerts, and system messages and usage. Users will be able to configure mitigations and threat responses based on set limits for threat severities and types. AI/ML will be used to continually improve tool mapping, mitigations, threat responses, and anomalous behavior discovery. We propose a novel system to automatically import, integrate, and map cybersecurity tools and databases into a low-code or no-code platform to automatically identifying cybersecurity risks holistically across multiple tools. Additionally, the proposed solution will be able to detect and report on insider threat behavior. Results will be provided with severity and confidence scores and the ability to sort by importance.

The ability to maintain flexible deterrent options in various situations relies upon maintaining an accurate picture of (1) what is happening now, and (2) what could happen in the future. Because the set of future possibilities is infinite, it is important to broadly characterize these possibilities and to best understand those which require a response or present the greatest threats to our assets. For this Phase I STTR, we propose to develop and test a Classification Approach for Assessing Spacecraft Threats (CAAST) that accounts for non-gaussian spacecraft state uncertainties and provides a probabilistic assessment of adversary co-orbital COAs as kinetic threat possible or kinetic threat not possible. We will develop a Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model with Gaussian Mixture uncertainties algorithm that accounts for adversary/asset state uncertainty, quantifies confidence in the threat assessment, and drastically reduces computation time compared with existing reachability solutions. The significant reduction in computation time will enable threat characterization for many adversary/asset pairs at once. Threat characterization on this scale is not currently possible due to computational intractability of existing tools. Our Phase I solution will focus on impulsive maneuvers at the start of the adversary trajectory, will focus on 2-body dynamics with use cases originating beyond GEO and terminating in GEO, and will classify threats as kinetic threat possible vs. kinetic threat not possible. Our Phase II solution will expand on the Phase I proof-of-concept to encompass all adversary thrust profiles, three body dynamics, all orbital regimes, and threat classification between kinetic threat, non-kinetic threat, and non-threatening. Our combined Trusted Space and CUBRC team has significant experience developing tools for spacecraft threat assessment, reachability analysis, and hypothesis management.

Detection and quantitation of autoantibodies is increasingly prioritized for diagnosis and management of type 1
diabetes (T1D). Assay methods and systems that can achieve clinically relevant performance in detecting and
quantitating T1D-relevant autoantibodies—from the standpoint of key performance parameters such as
sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and quantitative accuracy—have, due to a constellation of factors, proven
elusive. To address this need, we have pioneered the RAABET (Resonance AutoAntiBody Energy Transfer)
T1D assay, a homogeneous assay for rapid, no-wash multiplexed detection of T1D-associated autoantibodies
from small volumes (1-10 μL) of patient plasma or serum. The innovative RAABET assay is designed around
labeling—for each autoantibody target—two separate pools of each associated recombinant antigen: one pool
with a long-lived high-quantum-efficiency terbium cryptate Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) donor
and a second pool with a small-molecule fluorophore FRET acceptor. Given the approximately 12-13 nm
mean distance between tips of the two autoantibody epitope binding regions and the ~3.5nm spacing between
the edges of each epitope binding arm, the dual-pool-labeling approach, when translated to a homogeneous
assay, yields a nearly ideal architecture for autoantibody-specific FRET signaling, with readily modeled
probabilistic donor-acceptor pairing.
RAABET development work that has already been completed has included optimizing conjugation protocols,
developing a crosstalk correction algorithm that improves quantitative accuracy for each target species in the
multiplex reaction, and conducting preliminary stability studies. The early version of the RAABET assay
performed very well in recently conducted preliminary validation studies using multiple panels of clinical
samples. The performance of RAABET in this early testing is particularly compelling when compared to
ELISA, which, while a generally well-established and high-performing assay method, has been seen time and
again to perform poorly for T1D autoantibodies. The other alternatives to ELISA for T1D autoantibodies all
have deficiencies, including poor analytical sensitivity and/or requirements for expensive and difficult-to-
maintain equipment. T1D autoantibodies is a persistent area of need; RAABET is the assay that can finally
meet this need.
In this project, we propose to undertake essential—and innovative—RAABET probe engineering initiatives.
The probe engineering work, along with associated verification activities, is encompassed by Aim 1 of this
project. Aim 2 of this project encompasses additional priorities in advancing the innovative RAABET T1D
assay toward final clinical validation and product launch: conducting an expanded stability testing program,
developing an enhanced sample preparation method for accommodating low-volume whole blood samples in
RAABET without need for additional laboratory instrumentation; and characterizing the RAABET assay’s
performance in characterizing binding affinities of target autoantibodies, an additional level of functionality that
the assay inherently supports and that can provide critical information for current and future needs in T1D
diagnosis and management.",  ,,,,AMY  DROITCOUR,,(650) 799-6364,amy.droitcour@wave80.com,,  ,

COPD is a heterogeneous, multi-phenotypic disease with lung damage derived from smoking, vaping, cooking, forest fires, pollution, chemical exposure, and numerous occupational hazards (e.g., 1st responders, military, agricultural and industrial workers). The most common form of COPD is chronic bronchitis, which is associated with mucus hypersecretion that results in greatly reduced lung function leading to a decreased quality of life. Current treatments for COPD largely treat symptoms without meaningfully altering the course of the disease. There are currently no truly disease-modifying treatments available for COPD patients. Different families of proteases have been implicated in COPD. Recently, a specific protease has been shown to be upregulated in lung epithelial cells and macrophages, and its expression in these cells correlates directly with disease severity in human COPD patients. The target is a pleiotropic membrane bound protein that processes cytokines, growth factors, receptors, and receptor ligands on the cell surface. Verra Therapeutics has developed a soluble protein inhibitor, VTH245, that selectively inhibits the proteolytic activity and blocks deleterious activities in models of COPD. This innovative protein inhibitor has significant advantages in specificity (compared to small molecule inhibitors), penetration (smaller than monoclonal antibodies), and immunogenicity (based on a naturally occurring protein sequence). Data generated in our Phase I project have demonstrated that VTH245 treatment in a gold-standard mouse model of cigarette smoke-induced COPD 1) significantly reduced biomarkers of lung inflammation and destruction; 2) reduced inflammatory cell counts in the lung lavage to near-air levels; and 3) reduced mucus hypersecretion. Further, these results matched or exceeded performance of the marketed drug, roflumilast. While roflumilast treatment is commonly associated with a range of toxicities that limit its use, VTH245 was well tolerated and displayed the highest survival rate over 6-months (20/20 animals). This Phase II SBIR project will extend our findings from Phase I and provide key IND-enabling safety data to inform future first-in- human studies through the execution of the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To identify the preferred route of administration for VTH245 for treating COPD by comparing the efficacy provided by two clinically relevant routes of administration, subcutaneous and inhaled, determining a single route for use in toxicity studies in Aim 3; Aim 2: To perform critical CMC activities for VTH245 process development and generate high quality VT245 for use in toxicity evaluations in Aim 3; and Aim 3: To generate a preliminary safety profile of VTH245 to support IND approval. Successful completion of the Phase II program will further define the target product profile for VTH245 and provide critical data for an IND submission to support a clinical development program.",  ,,,,CHRISTOPHER L PRINCE,,6072276828,cprince@verrathera.com,,  ,

Security forces and emergency management secure the scene, rescue the pilot, and reduce any hazards. Holloman Air Force Base (AFB) is one such base that sees many aircraft crashes and mishaps due to its role as a critical Air Force training and test location. Each year the base sees at least three (3) major mishaps. Holloman’s 49th Security Forces Squadron (49 SFS) deploys 13 Defenders to secure the area while emergency managers investigate the presence of hazardous chemicals (i.e. hydrazine leaks). These investigations can easily last for three (3) days. That’s three days of Defenders standing in the desert as listening posts / observation posts (LP/OPs) with temperatures as high as 102°F. This risks Airmen heat casualties while standing post. The 49 SFS also only has 100 personnel. One crash equates to 13% of its total manning dedicated to security for three days in the desert, taking Airmen away from other threats that could occur along the base perimeter. This manpower burden puts the installation’s 17,000 Airmen and civilian personnel, $7.8 billion in assets, and 66,000 acres at risk. The heavy time and manpower strain outlined above exists across the Air Force. Whenever there is a crash or mishap, bases deploy personnel in similar fashions to secure the scene, investigate hazards, and search for survivors. Autonomous systems such as ground robots or small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) are commonly looked to as a solution. But sUAS have limited flight operating times and autonomous systems require continuous power, especially for multi-day operations. Despite the Air Force’s embrace of autonomous systems, the lack of consistent power limits practical implementation and general adoption. The result is the Air Force deploying large numbers of its personnel inefficiently and in ways that potentially jeopardize broader air base safety.  Ghost Robotics proposes to partner with the 49 SFS on a SBIR Phase II project to develop solar charging capabilities for its Q-UGV security robots. Ghost Robotics will research, develop, test, and evaluate (RDT&E) new solar charging capabilities for its Q-UGV charging station so the 49 SFS can deploy the robots to remote crash sites without the need for grid power or diesel backup generators. This will free up at least nine (9) Defenders from standing in the desert for days at a time while emergency management teams assess hazards. Assuming a minimum 40 hour work week, this results in 1,080 Airmen labor hours given back to the squadron for other more pressing security functions. The newly developed capability will capitalize on the abundant solar resources available at Holloman and present at many DAF installations around the globe, reduce the reliance on grid power and generators, free up manpower, and introduce a new DAF autonomous security capability that can operate 100% off grid in austere conditions.",Adam  Sheridan,,(505) 846-8142,AFNWC.CZ.SBIRSTTR@us.af.mil,Jordan  Caldwell,,(302) 612-1461,jcaldwell@ghostrobotics.io,,  ,

Unwanted masking sounds reduce the intelligibility of speech and other sounds listeners want to hear. “Source
Separation” signal processing methods are known that extract important sources and “scrub” unwanted noise,
but these methods typically require the acoustic sensors (microphones) and sources they process to be fixed
in space—the optimal separation solutions computed by such methods are position dependent. Movement
degrades the quality of separation (QoS) of the computed separation solutions, and reconvergence following a
change of position takes time—often tens of seconds. This constraint limits the practical utility of traditional
separation methods. We propose a novel assistive listening system called CIM (“Clarity in Motion”) which is
capable of maintaining an optimal separation of acoustic sources in real-world environments changing at
“human” speeds. CIM dramatically shortens the time required to reconverge separation solutions. CIM is
designed for integration into NIH’s Open Speech Platform (OSP) initiative for hearing aids and personal audio
devices. CIM leverages STAR’s Multiple Algorithm Source Separation (MASS) application framework of
“pluggable” acoustic separation modules. MASS is compatible with OSP and is publicly available on GitHub.CIM is room-centric, sensor image-based, and listener-specific. Important system components are
embedded in the room itself, rather than in the user’s ear (e.g. hearing aid). CIM delivers listener-specific audio
to one or more users through their smartphones. CIM employs multiple microphones distributed around a room
and connected to a CIM Room Server (a signal processing device) supporting all listeners. This Server pro-
cesses the audio signals from these shared Room Mics to scrub unwanted sounds from private Listener
Mics, which are typically hearing aid, cochlear implant, or other head-mounted mics specific to each listener.
Each listener uses a CIM mobile device app to register their Listener Mic and specify which acoustic sources to
scrub. The Room Server computes an individualized scrubbed audio stream for each listener and transmits it
wirelessly to their Listener App. The Listener App outputs this stream to the listener’s hearing aid, cochlear
implant, or earbuds as a standard line level or current loop audio signal.The heart of CIM’s innovation resides in two separate proprietary techniques, described herein, for
reducing the separation solution deconvergence (ΔQ) associated with source or sensor movements.In Phase I, we will characterize the relationship between ΔQ and relevant objective parameters of
acoustic scenes; implement and quantitatively evaluate the contribution of our novel methods for reducing
motion-induced deconvergence; and carry out a perceptual study of the relationship between movement-
induced solution deconvergence and both listening effort and intelligibility judgements.The CIM system will help hearing-impaired listeners hear clearly in noisy rooms with moving sources.",  ,,,,RICHARD S GOLDHOR,,(781) 861-7827,rgoldhor@protonmail.com,,  ,

We will refine the remote control interface to be usable for professional caregivers and family care partners and develop a suite of autonomous activities that Stretch can carry out. We will explore the functional utility of Stretch in a range of home environments, including common rooms with multiple people. These efforts will yield a scalable, affordable, flexible Stretch Cognitive and Physical Assistant that can improve the quality of life for older adults with a range of cognitive and physical impairments. The research objectives will be accomplished through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Refine and broaden the functional capabilities of Stretch to support older adults with a range of cognitive impairments and physical impairments. Aim 2: Advance the design of the user interfaces for each stakeholder group: older adults with cognitive and physical impairments, professional caregivers, and family care partners. Integrate remotely initiated tasks with autonomous task performance. Aim 3: Conduct embedded evaluations in naturalistic settings. This Phase II proposal directly meets multiple aspects of the NIH PAS-19-316 to develop “New technologies for in-home use or for coordination or delivery of services to sustain in-home living for individuals with MCI or AD/ADRD;” to design “Assistive robotics technology that can support a person in order to maintain or improve her/his independence, safety, and well-being when diagnosed with AD/ADRD and alleviate the burden of care;” and to develop “Novel technologies to monitor, assist, or maintain daily functioning of older individuals with AD/ADRD and other cognitive impairments.” The Stretch Cognitive and Physical Assistant robot has tremendous potential to support everyday home activities for older adults with MCI, AD, and/or mobility impairments, providing them with autonomy and increased quality of life.",  ,,,,AARON  EDSINGER,,4159940727,aedsinger@hello-robot.com,,  ,

To achieve the FDA’s required Sterility Assurance Level for use in humans, pharmaceutical products must
undergo terminal sterilization or aseptic manufacturing. This can be accomplished using physical or chemical
methods such as heat or formaldehyde for simple drug formulations; however, for pharmaceutical products that
have more complex drug formulations or that contain biologically active material important for downstream
applications (cell-containing therapeutics, vaccines, etc.), gamma irradiation is the preferred method of
sterilization. Gamma irradiation destroys nucleic acids to inactivate pathogens or render any cells replication
incompetent but leaves structural components like proteins intact. The logistical challenges of reliance on gamma
irradiation for terminal sterilization are, however, significant. Gamma irradiation requires high doses of radiation,
necessitating significant regulatory restrictions and specialized infrastructure, driving up costs and processing
times to manufacture a finished drug. As such, few biomedical research and production facilities are able to
adopt gamma-irradiation processes in-house to expedite manufacturing timelines, and they remain reliant on
centralized shielded facilities. Low energy electron irradiation (LEEI) represents a practical and inexpensive
alternative to gamma irradiation; however, a low penetration depth limits its utility for liquid suspensions. To
overcome these obstacles, Heat Biologics has partnered with Georgia Institute of Technology and Texas AandM
University to develop a microfluidics-enabled in-line continuous process for high-throughput LEEI sterilization of
pharmaceuticals. This strategy uses microfluidic manifolds to bring a continuously flowing product into the
working depth of an LEEI beam at a sufficient volumetric flow rate to allow for scaling to commercial capacity.
Since the product is terminally sterilized by this process, it enables end-to-end control as an alternative to
centralized sterilization at a shielded facility. In preliminary studies, rapid prototyping resulted in the design of a
consumable chip manifold. Computational modeling followed by experimental validation of the microfluidic chip
design demonstrated flow uniformity and good e-beam penetration through the channels without compromising
biological material. In this Phase I STTR project, this interdisciplinary team will finalize the microfluidics design
and test the prototype system in two pharmaceutical cell therapy products to confirm inactivation efficiency and
active agent bioavailability following irradiation. A consumable commercial set will be built to achieve 30L/hour
processing to ensure that the system can be appropriately scaled to accommodate commercial scale production.
Completion of these objectives will validate a high-throughput microfluidics device that when combined with e-
beam irradiation will provide standard biological research and production laboratories with the ability to produce
and irradiate biologically active pharmaceutical products at the site of manufacture.",  ,,,,ERIC  DIXON,,(919) 724-4285,edixon@nighthawkbio.com,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,  ,

KneeBRIGHT aims to motivate OA patients to conduct regular muscle strengthening exercise through an engaging, EMG-driven virtual worlds therapy. The system combines wireless EMG electrodes that are convenient for patients to use in a home setting with software that provides automated guidance through evidence-based, progressive exercise routines. Importantly, these exercises are presented to the patient in the form of fun and engaging activities to promote a positive experience and encourage continued adherence. Problem to be Addressed: OA is the leading cause of disability in the United States. Rehabilitation through quadriceps strengthening is a well-established, effective treatment for knee OA but patient adherence to exercise routines is low due to lack of guidance regarding optimal protocols and lack of engagement during the repetitive routines that patients find tedious and boring. Unsupervised, home-based exercise is particularly challenging. Innovative, engaging solutions are needed to enable and facilitate home participation, especially given the increased the use of telehealth due to the COVID19 pandemic. Phase II Results: The Phase II effort successfully developed a full-featured KneeBRIGHT system and deployed it in a 10-week randomized, controlled trial with knee OA patients. Participants using the KneeBRIGHT system for exercise increased their home exercise session participation by 20% compared to the control group. The study also demonstrated very positive usability ratings and positive trends in strength and balance outcomes. Phase IIB Program Summary: The proposed Phase IIB effort will yield a commercial KneeBRIGHT system supporting home-based physical therapy for knee OA. New developments will include: game enhancements to expand exercise options and device compatibility; upgraded sensor features; a secure provider dashboard web application for monitoring and guiding therapy; and HIPAA compliant cloud services integration. Pursuit of federal regulatory approval for the new device will include documentation of safety, creation of a user’s guide and other FDA labeling, and completion of actions supporting premarket notification. To establish acceptance by physical therapy practitioners, a network of multiple knee OA physical therapy providers will participate in a randomized, controlled clinical trial. An innovative provider-as-investigator study model will streamline translation of research to clinical practice. The clinical trial will evaluate the ability of the KneeBRIGHT system, as prescribed by a variety of PTs, to achieve clinically relevant outcomes. Impact: The system will have a substantial and sustained impact on public health by increasing knee OA patient adherence to home exercise and thereby reducing pain and restoring physical function.",  ,,,,EILEEN T KREPKOVICH,,4349731215,krepkovich1n@bainet.com,,  ,

The solution has three major specifications; it will be 1) a streamlined, plug-and-play microgrid for energy resiliency, 2) scalable and configurable to a wide variety of DAF applications, from forwarding operating bases (FOBs) to enduring installations, and 3) compatible with the DAF’s existing diesel generator infrastructure to extend on-base diesel fuel supplies in the event of a grid outage. The end result is a widely applicable, turn-key tool for energy independence and mission critical resiliency.   Currently, DAF installations and FOBs use diesel generators as back-up power to mission critical activities. In some cases, solar and battery storage are deployed, however the result doesn’t improve 24/7 resiliency and there is no integration with existing diesel generators. In comparison, Pecos Wind Power’s microgrid solution uses solar and wind power, alongside battery storage, to cost-effectively maximize 24/7, on-base renewable energy production and interoperate with diesel generators to optimize fuel supplies. In grid-connected mode, diesel generators are offline and the microgrid’s renewable energy is injected onto the base’s electric distribution system. During a grid-outage, the microgrid automatically switches to islanded-mode. In islanded-mode, the microgrid’s solar and wind production directly powers mission critical loads and reduces reliance on back-up diesel generators.   The technology enabling this microgrid solution is Pecos Wind Power’s commercial product, the PW85, an 85kW distributed wind turbine. The addition of wind power to any microgrid is essential to fill in the troughs/gaps of solar production. The PW85’s patented technology makes on-base distributed wind power accessible to nearly 4x more Department of Defense (DoD) locations compared to today’s best-in-class distributed wind technology. In addition, at a third the height of a typical wind turbine, it can be sited below a base’s glide slope to not impact radar or flightline operations. As such, the PW85 is uniquely suited for Defense applications and critical to securing 24/7 clean energy within the confines of the base.   The Phase II project will culminate in a hardware demonstration of the complete microgrid solution – including a PW85 wind turbine, solar array, and battery storage – interconnected to a diesel generator and adhering to cybersecurity requirements.

Building upon our accomplishments in Phase I, DATC will be developed based on the efficient high-fidelity constitutive modeling capability of mechanics of structure genome (MSG) and its companion code SwiftComp, the versatile structural analysis capabilities of two finite element analysis (FEA) packages Abaqus and MSC.Patran/Nastran, the general-purpose optimizer Dakota, and the state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) package TensorFlow. DATC will integrate all these tools into a unified and intuitive design framework, facilitating design setups and enabling innovative designs of structures made of tow-steered composites. MSG computes the location-dependent shell properties for FEA and Dakota performs optimization for varying fiber orientations, ply coverages (varying ply thickness and ply drops), and different materials with manufacturing constraints. ML provides ultra-efficient surrogate models to accelerate the optimization from days to hours. The associated computer codes are developed with an open architecture to allow users to add new functionalities for specific problems. Several realistic aerospace structures will be employed to verify the validate the developed tool and demonstrate the benefits from tailorable composites in reducing the structural weights and/or improving the load-bearing capacity. We expect to release DATC by the end of the Phase II as a user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI) plug-in for MSC.Patran/Nastran and Abaqus so that engineers familiar with these two FEA codes can easily use DATC to carry out analysis, parametric studies, and design optimizations of highly tailorable composite structures.nbsp;nbsp;nbsp;",NASA SBIR  Support Office,,(301) 937-0888,sbir@reisystems.com,Wenbin  Yu,,(765) 494-5142,wenbinyu@purdue.edu,Purdue University - Main Campus,  ,

Attitude determination require position, velocity, and time (PVT) information. A satellite can be unaware of its attitude due to any number of factors including deployment issues or hardware/software errors, this loss of positional awareness is known as lost-in-space. To acquire attitude information and solve the lost-in-space problem, star trackers are used to measure the positions of stars relative to the spacecraft and compare the pattern of the observed stars to their known absolute position from a star catalog. Existing star tracking attitude sensors are limited in their ability to operate above an angular rate of ~3-5 degrees/second, additionally as CubeSats and nanosats become more popular, there is a growing need for a low power, non-resource intensive attitude determination method that is capable of operating at higher angular rates than existing star trackers. Neuromorphic or event-based cameras appear to be ideal for solving these needs. Prime Photonics proposes to develop the Neuromorphic and Optical Constellation Tracker for Unstable spacecraft Attitude correction (NOCTUA) event-based star tracker. Event cameras are shutterless, and only detect changes in pixel intensity from frame-to-frame, not complete images. As a result, they offer much greater dynamic range at much lower data rates, processing power, and cost, than their conventional camera counterparts. The lower data rates and processing power make them an ideal sensor for resource limited spacecraft. Prime has experience with event cameras in prior R&D efforts including an event camera-base system to monitor debris ingestion at the inlet of a military aircraft engine. In this prior work we have developed code for multi object detection, velocity vector determination, and centroid calculation of event objects. For the solicitation application, Prime has already completed desktop proof-of-concept testing using an event camera rotated by hand up to 150 degrees per second and was able to detect star patterns printed on a test sheet, where a traditional frame-based camera’s output image was too blurry to resolve the stars. In the Phase I, we will demonstrate the ability of the NOCTUA system to track stars and determine its attitude while under high rates of angular spin and compare its performance to a traditional star tracker. We will modify an existing star tracking algorithm to work with events, as well as determine the event camera’s sensitivity limit (i.e., how faint can a star be to be useful in attitude determination). In Phase II, more advanced features of the system will be demonstrated, and the prototype device will be matured for use in military and commercial applications.",Jeffrey  Ganley,,(505) 853-6660,jeffrey.ganley@spaceforce.mil,Michael  Ellery,,(540) 961-2200,mike.ellery@primephotonics.com,,  ,

Nephele’s TaaS architecture enables assessment of multiple use cases; evaluation of new sensors and hardening techniques; data analytics; artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) development and evaluation; replay and after-action review; and feedback to IoT best practices and standards organizations – all within the context of collaborative military/commercial studies and experiments.  ",Anthony  Macera,,(315) 330-4480,anthony.macera.1@us.af.mil,Bruce  McQueary,,(321) 591-7371,bmcqueary@securboration.com,,  ,

Over the past decade, GaN-based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) have matured in reliability and performance and set the standard in high-power RF applications, with widespread adoption for commercial cellular base stations and as military applications. This performance has been achieved with numerous innovations, including the use of field plates to engineer the electric field profile, and to mitigate the trapping related anomalies in the GaN HEMTs which cause current collapse, dispersion, and current transients. Unfortunately, these field plates also inevitably significantly degrade the bandwidth of the HEMTs. In contrast, GaN HBTs, with their very large Gm and absence of trap coupling to the current conduction offer similar high power to the GaN HEMT, but greatly superior linearity (>20dB improvement in OIP3/Pdc). These advantages of the GaN HBT are further described in the following section. Realization of GaN HBT devices has been limited by the absence any well-behaved, shallow p-dopants for GaN. Bonded GaAs/GaN heterojunctions can overcome this GaN limitation by leveraging the effective, C-doped GaAs base in the well-established, InGaP-GaAs material system used in the cell phone industry.á Combining this standard emitter-base structure with an N-GaN collector and sub-collector via wafer bonding should produce a high power HBT IC technology with truly excellent RF and mm-wave performance. The proposed project will be a focused effort to advance the state-of-the-art by systematically investigating several promising approaches to achieve well-behaved pn junctions through p+GaAs/N-GaN bonding. These junctions will become the high-power BC junction of the proposed GaAs/GaN HBT. A bonded GaAs-GaN HBT device can be fabricated using slight modifications to Keysightĺs existing, well-established GaAs HBT IC process. Of Keysightĺs 99 existing processes required to produce their existing GaAs HBT ICs, only 6 will need to be redeveloped for the proposed GaAs-GaN HBT. This shortens the development process of the proposed HBT substantially and creates a simple path to mass production with minimal capital investment other than the bonding tool required. Once the bonding process is developed, MicroLink and Keysight will leverage existing experience and existing equipment that have been used for HBT devices for the past two decades to ramp up production of these devices quickly. The high efficiency and high linearity power amplifiers will be delivered to system integrators for use in X-Band Radar systems.",Thomas N Kazior,Program Manager,7035262056,thomas.kazior@darpa.mil,Willian  Mohr,,8475883001,wmohr@mldevices.com,,  ,

Contemporary satellite systems exhibit substantial inefficiencies in the long term, owing chiefly to the difficulty of repairing/modifying the architectures once on orbit. A more modularized design enables the architecture to reuse core subsystems for a variety of payloads, reconfigure the system’s layout at will, and replace faulty or outdated equipment.  Several groups have developed modular power/data interfaces, but none to date are able to carry significant payloads attached through them through typical launch loads.       CU Aerospace (CUA) teamed with Altius and Starbright propose the development of a Launch Hardened Universal Payload Interface (LH-UPI) for future flight demonstration.  This modular power-data interface is based upon CUA’s Guideless Resilient Androgynous Serial Port (GRASP) interface which allows for androgynous “hard dock” launch hardened connection of different modules in multiple orientations, in combination with Altius’ MagTag interface also provides multifunctionality and a “soft dock” connection through their Electro-Permanent Magnet (EPM) technology.  The hybrid of the two technologies marries the advantages of both “hard” and “soft” dock capability into a single package with power/data interfaces and potentially fluid transfer capability.  Key benefits of this approach include: (i) launch lock capable to support ESPA-class payloads through launch loads while still being modularly robotically swappable on-orbit; (ii) Magnetic soft docking EPMs help reduce the risk of bounce-off while GRASP’s mechanical system secures a hard-lock and pulls together power/fluid connectors; (iii) No power hold EPMs and the GRASP system are designed to not require power to maintain hold; (iv) Passive + androgenous active architecture enables modular components with an active side that can androgynously connect to either a passive or another active interface; and (v) Electronics/motors can be located in a separate installation tool to lower the interface overhead cost and mass per attached module.     Prior government-funded efforts allowed CUA and Altius to advance their patented GRASP and MagTag technologies to TRL 5. The goal of this proposed effort is to (i) reduce risk for these subsystems, (ii) choose a preliminary fluid transfer coupler design using COTS terrestrial blind-mate fluid quick-disconnects that fits within the LH-UPI architecture, and (iii) develop a preliminary LH-UPI hardware design for Phase II qualification testing.  In Phase II, the team would focus on developing the launch hardened power/data interface of a flight-like LH-UPI to fully characterize its performance and perform a robotic technology demonstration experiment.  Flight development and qualification of space-compatible fluid-ports and an in-space flight verification demonstration would be proposed for Phase III.",Jason  Guarnieri,,(505) 853-4945,jason.guarnieri.1@spaceforce.mil,David  Carroll,,(217) 778-6461,carroll@cuaerospace.com,,  ,

The use of H2O2 enables the menstrual cup to be disinfected effectively at lower temperatures, thereby eliminating the need for an energy source, and even using non-sterile or gray water. In order to deliver an effective dose of 0.1% H2O2 the tablet weighs 2.2 grams, measures 18 mm in diameter by 6 mm in height.  Initial tests show the sodium percarbonate tablets are very stable when tested in 54°C accelerated storage stability ovens. There were no changes in the product resulting in any quality concerns. The tablets were also tested in plastic freezer bags with no other packaging protection; hardness values minorly increased, but there were no signs of swelling, no loss of H2O2 content, and no significant increase in dissolution time.    The Neutralizer Despite its superior disinfecting capabilities, hydrogen peroxide can be an irritant, particularly in contact with mucosal surfaces. In the contact lens industry, they have overcome this problem by using a platinum disk that catalyzes the decomposition of a hydrogen peroxide solution to H2O over time. The catalyst accelerates the decomposition of the H2O2, while preliminary data suggests that it does not dramatically reduce the bacterial death rate (KD) in the disinfection of the menstrual cups. The platinum disk is designed for multiple uses, minimizing the need to carry extra components for proper cleansing.    The Case The Courtesy Cups disinfection case is a compact menstrual cup case, measuring 60 by 75 mm and about the size of a mini can of soda. The case is lightweight, under 50 grams, it’s leakproof and sturdy. Because of Courtesy Cups' unique sanitizing tablet system, the case does not require the additional weight of heavy batteries or extra water and it doesn’t need to be plugged into an outlet – perfect for women in austere environments, but useful for women in any environment. The Courtesy Cups system uses 78% less water when compared to rinsing with drinking water and 135% less water than boiling with a camping cookpot, which is important for women in austere environments with limited access to water.   The Courtesy Cups cleaning system has compartmentalized sections that allow for cleaning, drying, and storage of the menstrual cup. The case has three components: top, middle, and bottom which combine in a cylindrical form. The top segment f is where the cup is sanitized, it’s filled with a small amount of potable water and the tablet is added. The middle segment serves as a connection for the entire menstrual cup case. It also contains the tablets, keeping them dry and clean.

Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) is an important part of these responsibilities. The Multi-Static Active Coherent (MAC) system developed by the Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) and deployed from the Boeing Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA) provides a wide area ASW search capability. These systems enable the Navy to project ASW capabilities rapidly at any location on the globe, detecting and tracking threat submarines over tactically relevant timescales.  NAWC’s MAC system consists of air-dropped SSQ-125 sources and SSQ-101 (Air Deployed Active Receiver [ADAR]) receiver buoys spread over a wide area to be searched for adversary submarines. The patterns in which the sources and receivers are deployed, particularly the spacing between buoys, are adapted to the presumed ocean conditions. The Navy’s oceanographic assets maintain global ocean circulation models, such as NCOM or HYCOM. These models are based on partial differential equations that capture the known physics of the ocean and are continually adjusted for observations reported from around the globe. Forward deployed US Navy forces and systems, such as the MAC system, receive ocean forecasts from NCOM/HYCOM for the time and location where systems will be deployed. These forecasts provide 3D ocean sound speed and current fields to be used as inputs to acoustic wave propagation models that calculate transmission loss (TL) and travel times. These are key inputs to tactical decision aids and target localization and tracking. The ocean is complex and temporally evolving, and sound speed forecasts degrade with time, thereby impacting processes  that depend upon them.  Sound speed directly impacts localization of submarines because it is needed to convert target echo travel times to ranges and target locations. Any degradation to the accuracy of the sound speed along the path of travel of the target echo will translate into degradation in target location and tracking. Ocean acoustic tomography (OAT), a technique of imaging the ocean sound speed field, similar to a Computerized Axial Tomography (CAT Scan), provides the opportunity to improve NAWCs real-time understanding of the sound speed field. The ability to transmit coherent signals and measure travel times on all receivers enables tomography to be used to track the 4D ocean sound speed field, inverting the measured travel times of the rays making up the direct blast signals received on each buoy.  Standing up a tomography system using the sources and receivers organic to the MAC system by integrating state-of-the-art data assimilation methods with the Navy’s ocean forecasts will enable the MAC system to produce better target location and tracking estimates as well as optimize detection performance.",John H Joseph,Engineer,(301) 342-2121,john.h.joseph.civ@us.navy.mil,Kevin  Heaney,,(703) 346-3676,kevin.heaney@appliedoceansciences.com,,  ,

While situational awareness can be tied to a variety of data-types impacting a mission, for the purposes of this effort, situational awareness tied to geospatial intelligence will be the focus. When a warfighter enters an operating area or supports personnel within an environment, their geospatial situational awareness will be driven by prior mission preparation and the map tools they are leveraging – such as ATAK and WinTAK. However, solely relying on memory from mission preparation, ATAK or WinTAK maps, or a combination of the two, may not afford the warfighter with sufficient SA, particularly if additional data feeds such as live, airborne, full-motion-video (FMV), are being utilized. The addition of a FMV feed may provide valuable information, but if managing the additional feed causes cognitive-overload, the value of the additional information is negated. Due to this, it is important for warfighters to gain the valuable insights provided by multiple displays but do so in a way that allows them to understand all the data across all the displays – affording them optimal situational awareness. Situational Awareness is defined as “the perception of environmental elements with respect to time and/or space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the future.” This definition offers three key components: perception, comprehension, and projection. An absence of any of these components significantly hinders a warfighter’s effectiveness. Without perception, a warfighter is missing valuable information within the operating environment. Without comprehension, a warfighter may perceive all the elements within the operating environment effectively but, due to high cognitive-load, struggle to comprehend all the data-sources appropriately. Without projection, a warfighter struggles to forecast into the future based on changing variables. The most common changing variable is time. As time passes, someone with optimal situational awareness should be able to project, with a reasonable amount of accuracy, how circumstances may change. Lacking this ability can be detrimental to a mission.",sbir@socom.mil  sbir@socom.mil,,,sbir@socom.mil,David  Geisler,,(608) 824-1131,sbir@socom.mil,,  ,

The most advanced example of the shift toward attritable weapons is AFRL and Kratos’ XQ-58A Valkyrie. The XQ-58A will handle essential tasks such as SIGINT/ELINT detection, raise radar warning receiver (RWR) alerts, and/or bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) reception that previously require a high-end manned fighter. A key objective of the low-cost requirement is to make it possible to have many of these units to gather information on many fronts and in combination with onboard or offboard offensive weapons wear down the enemy’s capabilities. This proposal is to make a RF receive Personality System (RPS) that empowers the XQ-58A UAS to accomplish this sensing task. The purpose of this SBIR is to design RF modules that will collect RF energy from an antenna array, combine small groups of these inputs at the RF layer, in the process broadly pointing their receive “beam” in a desired direction, while also shifting the RF down to a baseband frequency range that is suitable for the ADCs inputs of the Zynq Ultrascale+ to ingest. The Zynq’s will then use digital delay methods to create high gain, highly directional receive beam(s) in desired direction(s). Because some of combining gain is achieved at the RF layer, but much is also achieved at a digital signal processing (DSP) layer, this will be a hybrid beamforming system. Most modern phased arrays are hybrid as it provides a good balance between the hardware size, weight and power and cost (SWaP-C) versus capability. The capability advantages the DSP brings to the table include the ability to point multiple receive beams, steer nulls toward jamming signals, and interface easily with other DSP firmware for tasks like SIGINT/ELINT detection, radar warning, and/ or bistatic SAR reception.   MagiQ Technologies is performing groundbreaking low phase noise work.  Superb phase noise is needed by the AF as we up- and down-convert RF signals, because any phase noise present on our local oscillators (LOs) will translate directly onto any powerful RF tone (e.g., jammers or co-sited transmissions) that we convert up or down.  This spreads the powerful tone’s energy, and will tend to obscure any weak signal-of-interest (SOI) that might be close in frequency to the more powerful tone.  This effect is critical to complete SIGINT/ELINT collection.  Additionally, radar resolution is very well known to be very sensitive to phase noise.  This proposal expands on our plan to generate an excellent quality low phase noise LO, while at the same time keeping a very tight rein on the circuitry size.  This innovation brings advantages that will add many dBs of sensitivity to the phased array system.",Jeff  Massman,,(937) 713-8047,jeffrey.massman.5@us.af.mil,Mark  Lucas,,(617) 661-8300,mark.lucas@magiqtech.com,,  ,

The battlespace awareness functions as a foundation for planning appropriate courses of action (CoAs) to respond to any possible threats and safeguard our space assets. This work proposes the development of the Multiple Model Adaptive Estimator with Koopman Operator (MMAE-KO). It is concerned with the enabling of proactive battlespace awareness in the increasingly congested, contested, and competitive space domain to the warfighter or other satellite operators. In particular, MMAE-KO will aid in classifying and tracking space objects within the vicinity of our space assets, as well as anticipating adversary spacecraft CoAs with different possible maneuvering capabilities. This is accomplished by developing a Bayesian framework that automatically filters the measurement data of high-valued space objects to identify their probable maneuvering types and maneuvering capabilities, their associated control policies, and threat level to our space assets. The probability of threat associated with each single model is evaluated considering the reachable set of the adversary spacecraft, evaluated in the Koopman Operator (KO) framework. The KO solution of the system generates a polynomial transition map of the state, such that the time propagation of any state can be calculated through a computationally fast polynomial evaluation rather than going through numerical integration. That is, the Koopman analysis of the dynamics obtains the complete eigendecomposition of the system, where any given observable can be represented as a linear combination of the basis functions. This representation leads to numerous advantages in astrodynamics, as it can be applied for the propagation of uncertainties and for the evaluation of the reachable set of the system. One of the main benefits is the trivial propagation of a large number of space objects, especially over different propagation models. Thus, we propose a new representation of the reachable set of states of a controlled system as a linear combination of the eigenfunctions, evaluated via the KO, analytically. The proposed MMAE-KO filter leverages the advantages of the MMAE filter with the KO representation of the dynamics to achieve a rapid and robust probabilistic identification of possible adversary spacecraft, with a classification of their possible actions, and prediction of their subsequent trajectories, as well as evaluation of their threat level to our space assets. As such, thanks to the KO state transition polynomial maps, the MMAE-KO algorithm is able to obtain a rapid prediction of the reachable set for each model, where the adaptive filter technique best utilizes a Bayesian update and hypothesis testing to assess the probability of each possible scenario. ",Carolyn  Sheaff,,(315) 330-7147,carolyn.sheaff@us.af.mil,David  Sudit,,(716) 949-6080,david.sudit@xanalytixsystems.com,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Richard  Linares,(617) 452-3840

Following reference is used to extract weather impact on 77GHz radars: https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/viirpt/sec5.htm.  Long Range Sensing: Driven by HUDSON radar high SNR. Reduction in Processing Burden: This is accomplished in by running radar analog beamforming and MIMO virtual arrays to cover the full large field of view in azimuth and elevation at long ranges.

MarPam Pharma aims to develop a one-time treatment for achieving durable remission of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), after which patients will no longer need to take antiretroviral therapy. Our
treatment is an autologous HIV-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) immune cell therapy that employs the
CXCR5 chemokine receptor as a homing device to direct either anti-HIV T cells or anti-HIV natural killer (NK)
cells into immune-protected “hidden” viral reservoirs in lymphoid B cell follicles, where most virus-producing cells
are located during chronic infection. Virus-specific CD8 T cells exert potent antiviral activity against HIV-1 and
Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), an animal model of HIV. Nevertheless, despite abundant CD8 T cell
responses in HIV-1-infected humans and SIV-infected macaques, these cells do not fully suppress virus
replication, likely because the majority of HIV-1 and SIV replication occurs in CD4+ T cells concentrated within
B cell follicles in secondary lymphoid tissues, where surprisingly few virus-specific CD8 T cells reside in infected
individuals. In fact, we found 40-fold lower levels of in vivo effector CTL to target viral (v)RNA+ cells (E:T) inside
compared to outside of B cell follicles, likely explained by the fact that very few virus-specific CD8 T cells express
the follicular homing molecule CXCR5. These findings suggest that the inability of HIV-specific CD8 T cells to
fully suppress virus replication may be due to a deficiency of virus-specific CD8 T cells in B cell follicles. As the
vast majority of virus-producing cells are CD4 T cells located in secondary lymphoid tissue and concentrated in
follicles during chronic HIV and SIV infections, we targeted these infected cells by infusing autologous antiviral
CAR/CXCR5-T cells in chronically SIV-infected rhesus macaques. The treated animals showed successful
homing of CAR/CXCR5-T cells to B cell follicles, evidence of direct contact of the CAR/CXCR5-T cells with
vRNA+ infected cells and decreased viral loads in treated animals compared to untreated animals. Our pilot
study showed that the treatment was safe and effective. These findings have prompted us to further refine
our promising targeted CAR/CXCR5-T cell therapy by enhancing its efficacy and to investigate whether this
targeted immune cell therapy could be developed using NK cells. CAR-T and CAR-NK cell therapies are
individualized therapies that modify a patient’s own immune cells to fight disease; NK cell therapies also have
the potential to function as off-the-shelf treatments using allogenic cells. This proposal seeks to optimize the
effectiveness of our CAR/CXCR5 immune cell therapy. In addition, we aim to generate and evaluate optimized
Car/CXCR5-T and -NK cells using less expensive production methods. Successful completion of the proposed
studies will lead to Phase II IND-enabling primate studies to assess the safety and efficacy of the T cell and NK
cell therapies for durable HIV remission.",  ,,,,MARIA C ATHANASIOU,,(920) 904-6868,maria@marpampharma.com,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,  ,

Among the many tasks required to provide this maintenance, an inspection of the interior cavity of the flight controls is essential. There are several flight controls on each aircraft, which include flaps, ailerons, elevators, and rudder.

DSC has personnel experienced in all the fields required to achieve this development and the facilities with all needed support equipment to complete the task. DSC proposes the development of an Automated Rivet Intelligent Extraction System (ARIES), which will remove thousands of rivets from flight controls with very minimal human interaction. The key ARIES developments that must all work to accomplish this goal include: Flexible tooling that can safely hold a range of different parts A sensor that can find and identify rivets and determine the position and size accurately It must not drill screws or open holes, so reliably detecting the difference with 100% accuracy is critical A sensor that can accurately measure the surface normal of the fastener A system that can take the input data from the sensor suite and drill the rivet without damaging the surrounding structure A system to break the rivet after drilling to release the skin The system should accomplish these tasks as fast or faster than a human does today and with higher accuracy.

Players will advance in a progression system where they start from a Ground Controller rank with defined rank badge color, operations, growing number of traffic, and event as they progress through the rank. Once the player unlocks all events and capabilities in their rank, they are promoted to the next rank. The events and capability milestones will be built by our ATC instructors based on the Navy’s curriculum and syllabus. Missions will be generated based on historical data of real-life operations or instructor generated, where the Assisted Guidance Engine verifies and adapts the scenario events and player activity requirements to the player’s rank.

Instructors will be able to review metrics for individual Sailors as well as aggregated metrics for the class and each mini game on a tailored website. Instructors will also have the ability on the website to override the Assisted Guidance Engine and assign manually-defined missions to the Sailors, both on an individual or class scale.   Based on our research and experience, there are a few online ATC related games that are low fidelity games that are not intended for training purposes and are mostly developed for amusement.

Although FE modeling represents a generally accepted practice for structural analysis, tools for generating the mesh reflecting as-built material structure of composite parts and repairs are not available, and therefore engineers are faced with a challenge of comparing CAD models or drawings of composite structure to CT scan data and manually introducing discrepancies into finite FE mesh. Geometric complexity of the flaws with a priori unknown effect has been preventing effective manual meshing. Converting the CT scans into FE mesh will provide the means for analysis-based assessment of the effects of manufacturing defects with a large span of severity/sizes in complex composite structures; and for developing repairs. The proposed solution shall address the following key requirements: (A) The ability to generate accurate subsurface geometry data for a composite structure that includes all manufacturing defects such as wrinkles and voids at ply interfaces. (B) The ability to automate the conversion of the CT scan-based geometry data to structural FE models revealing the effects of these defects on strength and fatigue performance for safe repairs, life-extending design changes, and disposition instructions. The FE mesh must be applicable to progressive damage and failure analysis of the laminated composite structure including manufacturing defects. This project will merge state of the art nondestructive measurements with composite durability and damage tolerance analyses into an add-on toolkit package for a commercial FE software program. The software toolset for rapid FE mesh generation of as-built composite parts and repairs will address a major gap in the structural diagnostics including free of human factor interpretation the nondestructive measurement data enabling the safe and cost-effective part disposition decisions. Phase I effort will demonstrate a semi-automated transition of CT-based measurements of a rotor blade section or wing section to a high-fidelity FE mesh that captures the composite material structure including ply-orientations with a refined 3D mesh including manufacturing defects.",Alan B Timmons,TPOC,3013428139,alan.b.timmons.civ@us.navy.mil,Yuriy  Nikishkov,,4045633773,yuri.nikishkov.ntc@gmail.com,,  ,

Klebsiella is a common Gram-negative pathogen causing community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, and K.
pneumoniae pneumonia is considered the most common cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia in the United
States. K. pneumoniae is a difficult infection to treat because of the organism's thick capsule that is usually best
treated with the last line antibiotic therapy such as carbapenems. However, carbapenem-resistant K.
pneumoniae (CRKP), one of the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), is an emerging cause of
antibiotic-resistant nosocomial infections associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. New therapies in
controlling CRKP-induced infections are urgently needed. Using recombinant protein and genetically modified
mouse knockout models, we have demonstrated that the short palate, lung, nasal epithelium clone (PLUNC) 1
(SPLUNC1) contributes to pulmonary host defense against K. pneumoniae induced infection. A novel SPLUNC1-
derived peptide from the antimicrobial motif of the SPLUNC1 protein, α4-Short, demonstrated more potent
antibacterial properties than the full-length recombinant SPLUNC1 protein and in vivo efficacy in a murine model
of respiratory infection. Based on additional modifications of α4-Short, we have recently developed a series of
rationally engineered antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that rapidly kill their microbial targets by permeabilizing
bacterial membrane regardless of the specific metabolic state of the bacteria. One of our lead AMPs, A4-153,
has demonstrated potent bactericidal activity against diverse difficult-to-treat multidrug resistant (MDR)
pathogens, including CRKP. Exciting, A4-153 is active against many CRKP that have developed resistance to
other membrane-active compounds, such as the natural AMP LL37 and colistin, an antibiotic of last resort. In
addition, we have found a substantially lower tendency for bacteria to develop resistance to A4-153 compared
to standard antibiotic agents and natural AMPs. Importantly, we found that similar to natural AMP LL37, A4-153
displayed no detectable hemolysis and could be safely administered to mouse lungs with very high
concentrations. We propose in this SBIR application to explore the feasibility of using the newly developed A4-
153 to prevent CRKP-induced pneumonia by killing CRKP and eradicating the CRKP biofilm in the abiotic and
biotic system using in vitro and in vivo models. The successful completion of the proposed aims in this Phase I
application will prepare us for IND-enabling studies to be presented in a subsequent Phase II application,
including multidose MTD, GLP toxicity in rodents and large animals, and initiation of GMP manufacturing.",  ,,,,REEN  WU,,(530) 219-1717,reenwu@gmail.com,,  ,

This allows smaller, lighter and more efficient airbreathing and rocket propulsion systems, as well as conventional gas turbine based civil power generation plants.  DARPA has expressed interest in the H2O2/RP1 propellant combination, which yields very powerful detonations, often exceeding 100 atmospheres and damaging hardware. RDCs in general are still a low-maturity technology, thus much work is still required in achieving operational stability and reliability, as oftentimes undesirable operating modes, such as counterrotating detonation waves and parasitic deflagrative combustion are observed, which sap energy from designed detonation waves and reduce combustion efficiency. Additionally, Liquid-Liquid detonations are specifically notable for their high pressure ratios and heat fluxes in comparison to gas-gas detonations, which has resulted in substantial, undesired damage to combustion chambers in past experiments at Purdue and IN Space.  In phase I work, HySonic investigated and successfully demonstrated control of unwanted acoustic modes and spectral clean-up in gas-gas RDCs through implementation of acoustically absorptive chamber linings. Building on this, a 1-year base and second-year option work is proposed addressing four prime objectives: 1) eliminate chamber damage through careful shaping of injector and chamber geometry, 2) control detonative behavior by applying novel wall treatments to combustion chambers and propellant manifolding, 3) implement active propellant cooling in order to enable appreciable burn times, and 4) to mature LLRDE technology to TRL 6 by integrating all the former objectives into a single test article. ???????

Wildfire are becoming more frequently and severe due to climate change, resulting in growing exposures of
major population to high level of benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from biomass-burning emissions.
Wildfire exposure pose a serious threat to the health and the well-being of humans. Currently, assessment of
personal exposure to wildfire is dependent on taking environmental samples and analyzing the samples using
expensive analytical techniques, which cannot adequately represent personal exposure due to the temporal and
spatial variation of the metabolite concentrations. Biological detection of biomarkers has great potential to
overcome the limitation of conventional techniques and provides accurate measurements of personal exposure
levels. In this SBIR project, DL ADV-Tech proposes to develop an advanced europium-nanoparticles
enhanced time-resolved fluorescent (TRF) immunoassay biosensor which provides extremely sensitivity
(pg/ml level), short turnaround time (lt10 minutes), simple operation and low cost (lt$5 for each test) for
non-invasively analyzing wildfire exposure in urine samples. A major significance of this proposed
approach is the ability to on-site and very accurately analyze low amount of biomarkers by leveraging our
advanced nanomaterials signal amplification technique and multiplex sensing technique. The proposed
biosensor includes a paper-based strip to simultaneously measure multiple metabolites, 2-naphthol (2-NAP), 1-
hydroxypyrene glucuronide (1-OHPG) and S-phenyl mercapturic acid (S-PMA), where newly developed
nanomaterial, europium (Eu)-based nanoparticles (YVO4:Eu) is introduced to achieve high sensitivity. A portable
TRF reader will be equipped to quantify the concentrations of targets. We have demonstrated that using the
advanced Eu-based nanoparticles as signal label, the proposed fluorescent immunoassay is expected to
improve the stability, reliability and accuracy in detection of wildfire-associated biomarkers in urine. Incorporated
with this innovative signal amplification strategy, the sensitivity of the proposed biosensor is expected to be
significantly increased. Using the proposed biosensor, the measurement of personal wildfire smoke exposure
biomarkers can be completed within 10 minutes and the detection limit can as low as 0.1 ng/ml. In this Phase I
project of proof-of-concept, we will focus on the biosensor with two test zones that simultaneously quantify three
urinary metabolites (2-NAP, 1-OHPG and SPMA). The proposed biosensor will be fabricated and validated, and
the analytical 'figures of merits' of the biosensor will be established. In Phase II, the biosensor will be further
optimized for on-site applications in real world conditions and scaled-up for detecting more biomarkers
associated with wildfire exposure. This highly precise and truly portable TRF biosensor will provide a non-
invasive, sensitive, simple, rapid, robust, and inexpensive assessment tool, which will revolutionize current
biomonitoring technique for assessing personal exposure levels with shorter time and lower cost.

Surgical Site Infection (SSI) is one of the major complications of implant surgery, especially in spinal surgery,
where SSI leads to unfavorable health and functional outcomes. Antimicrobial coatings have been explored as
a way to prevent microbial colonization on the surface of pedicle screws. However, current strategies to generate
antimicrobial coatings do not show broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity; in fact, they can engender bacterial
and fungal resistance. N8 Medical proposes a pedicle screw with a novel anti-infective coating based on
ceragenins (CSAs), which mimic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and are able to eradicate both bacterial and
fungal populations (including resistant strains) and to prevent the formation of biofilms without engendering
resistance. The coating will be designed as a polycaprolactone (PCL) substrate loaded with CSA, a synthetic
compound mimicking naturally occurring AMPs that shows dose-dependent anti-infective activity against Gram-
positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. N8 Medical’s technology will disrupt the medical devices
antimicrobial coating market by proposing a solution that has efficacy against a broad-spectrum of pathogens,

the SSI rate during spinal surgery, N8 Medical will 1) reduce the burden on the healthcare system, associated
with longer hospital stays and revision surgeries; 2) reduce the frequency of implant failure; and 3) improve the
quality of life (QoL) of patients undergoing spinal surgery. Being highly scalable, N8 Medical’s coating platform
has the potential to prevent surgical site infections in a wide range of clinical interventions and improve the QoL
of patients in need of any kind of indwelling medical device. N8 Medical will sell its coated pedicle screws to the
healthcare system through a combination of direct and indirect sales. The flexibility of the platform will allow the
company to consider a licensing-based business model in the long term. This SBIR Phase I project aims at
establishing the technical feasibility of N8 medical’s CSA-based coating for titanium pedicle screws, which are
used in spinal surgery. To achieve this, N8 Medical will evaluate the pedicle screws coated with CSA-loaded
PCL (different concentrations of CSA and varying percentages of PCL) for their in vitro efficacy against resistant
Staphylococcus strains. In addition, the release of CSA will be measured by HPLC and the coating durability will
be evaluated using a lumbar vertebra model. Finally, the efficacy and safety of the coating will be tested in vivo
in a rabbit spinal surgery model. The success of the Phase I project will lay the ground for Phase II activities
where N8 Medical will optimize the coating formulation and the production process, and further investigate
coating biocompatibility, efficacy, and safety.",  ,,,,GLENN  BRUNNER,,(614) 946-4178,gbrunner@n8medical.com,,  ,

In the operation of runways, clearing of Foreign Object Debris (FOD) is vital to maintaining runway uptime and safety during aircraft takeoff and landing. The presence of FOD presents a critical hazard to aircraft. Clearing runways of FOD is labor intensive and tedious, requiring the full attention of Airmen performing runway inspections. Additionally, once the FOD is identified and removed, there is no current FOD data collection platform in place. Analytical AI (AAI) is a small business that specializes in Artificial Intelligence (AI). AAI will develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms and a FOD data gathering platform to provide on-duty Airmen with notifications of FOD in near real-time. The cameras required for the system will be integrated with vehicles and with pre-existing fixed locations (e.g. light posts, etc.) and used during runway inspection for FOD. Technology development under this effort contributes to mission need fulfillment in the area of sensors and AI.  AAI’s FOD detection systems specifically improve overall understanding of conditions generating FOD, will contribute to more rapidly detection of FOD, and will improve safety and decrease the downtime from expensive equipment failures due to undetected FOD. The specific mission impact of this project on the DAF and Department of Defense (DoD) will include safer aircraft and reduced runway downtime. AAI will use Ellsworth AFB as a use case for technology.  The technology will additionally be useful at other military installations and DAF bases, at temporary runway infrastructure, and for commercial airports where FOD is also a recognized, expensive problem impacting airway safety and efficiency.

California’s Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Reduction Law (SB 1383) is the largest change to it's recycling and waste industry since the 1980s. The law establishes new organic waste collection and recycling programs, food recovery programs, and requirements for jurisdictions to procure recycled organic products, contamination monitoring audits and outreach. All of these activities are a coordinated effort to reduce the amount of organic waste that is sent to landfills by 75 percent by 2025, an action that will greatly reduce the impact of climate change. During Phase I of the EPA SBIR Solicitation 68HERC22C0022, Zabble implemented a novel feature to automatically detect and classify contaminants from an image using an AI model and notify users when certain contaminants are found. The overall goal of the present Phase I proposal is to develop Zabble Zero™ Mobile Tagging™ into an efficient tool for contamination monitoring audits to help jurisdictions comply with SB1383’s requirements. Zabble will develop a fully functional, self-serve, efficient, low-cost solution for jurisdictions, haulers and consultants in California by updating the AI model and user workflows. Zabble’s solution has the potential to reduce the time it takes to collect, aggregate and report data by 20x, compared to current methods of using pen and paper, while influencing behavior change via real-time communication and targeted outreach. Institutions and non-profits such as Stanford, The Recycling Partnership and UCSF use the Zabble Zero platform to track their progress to zero waste. In 2021, Zabble was recognized, by Startus Insights, as one of the top 5 AI startups advancing the circular economy. In 2022, so far, our clients have measured more than 15,000 tons of materials and prevented more than 100 tons from going to landfills.

This holistic inventory aggregation and management system will allow material recovery facilities (MRFs) to accurately evaluate inbound waste by weight and track recovered materials inventories. Additionally, using a FIFO inventory tracking system, our product will confirm the sale of recovered materials to end markets and allow waste generators to track the end market destination of their recovered materials. The software, Real Time Recycling Inventory Management (RTR), will resolve inaccurate and subjective waste reporting. Industry standard recycling reporting is generated by a visual inspection of arriving waste, prior to any processing. This is problematic for two primary reasons: 1. Visual grading of weights is inherently subjective. Through internal studies, we have determined that visual grading is roughly 70% accurate. Our software, in conjunction with adequate scales, will return up to 99% accurate results. 2. Because visual grading is completed prior to processing, there is no guarantee that recoverable commodities are sorted and sold to outlets other than landfills and incinerators. Our software will only assign grading percentages to recovered material, ensuring accurate reporting of percentages of waste sent for landfill disposal. MRFs, the target customer, will be incentivized to utilize our software by charging waste generators a premium for recycling reporting implementing RTR software. Additional financial incentives include the possibility of offering variable disposal pricing to waste generators, based upon percentage of recyclable material in disposed waste. The pricing model will encourage further source separation of waste as recoverability will be maximized with fewer products in the waste stream. Heavily mixed waste loads will be harder to sort and limit the recovered percentage. Successful implementation of this software in the construction and demolition waste recovery sphere can be easily translated to the residential recycling system. We anticipate the opportunity to license the software to MRFS serving all components of the recycling system. This project will directly address Objective B, increase of collection and improvement of materials management infrastructure, and Objective C, reduction of contamination in the recycled materials stream, of the National Recycling Strategy.

The ability of public safety organizations and local governments to effectively communicate with community members in emergency situations is critical, especially in the immediate aftermath of large-scale events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods. According to the Department of Homeland Security’s Virtual Social Media Working Group (VSMWG), “Social media and collaborative technologies have become critical components of emergency preparedness, response, and recovery” (P. 4). Existing social media platforms face many challenges regarding effective disaster-related communication such as the dissemination of rumors and false information, undermining of authority and the promotion of terrorist acts (Alexander, 2013). Characteristics of false information often include forms of emotional exploitation, uncertainty of the facts, and/or trending topic discussions that hijack conversations for an intended profit or malicious intent. This type of false information can create mayhem and confusion in the aftermath of a disaster and cause further distress to vulnerable community members (VSMWG, 2018). GoodGames will prove the feasibility of a disaster-focused social networking platform to help mitigate the negative effects of current social media platforms and build community resilience to disasters, homeland security threats, and extreme weather (particularly extreme heat). This platform will help community members effectively communicate with one another, public safety organizations and community leaders before, during and after a disaster-related event. The platform will be designed with disaster-related communication as the primary intention and with the location and security features currently lacking in popular social media platforms. Furthermore, the platform will be designed with game aspects that are proven to enhance community engagement, strengthen connections to local authorities and educate community members on disaster preparedness and response measures.

This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II project proposes a novel deep learning approach to machinery prognostics. Many existing deep learning approaches focus on the most likely failure scenarios given a set of training data. Monitored equipment may not exbibit behavior covered in that training set, leading to low-confidence predictions. The proposed approach may not only predict the remaining useful life of a machine component, but also seeks to quantify the uncertainty of a prediction through an ensemble of models and a temporal fusion of predictions. As a result, maintenance decisions may be made from a risk-based perspective, eliminating unnecessary maintenance stemming from low-confidence predictions. Additionally, many existing deep learning approaches also lack the ability to intuitively explain their predictions to human users. In critical applications where poor predictions have serious consequences, maintenance personnel must understand and trust an artificially intelligent predictive maintenance partner. The proposed solution produces an intuitive visual explanation for the model’s prediction by highlighting and animating the segments of a raw data signal that are contributing most significantly to the prediction. This technology may allow trained personnel to quickly make optimal maintenance decisions by fusing data-driven insights with their existing domain expertise._x000D_

It is essential that those that are particularly harmful with a high global warming potential (GWP) are recovered correctly for proper recycling or disposal. Unfortunately, all too often, refrigerant is not properly recovered either due to system failure, technician error, or unincentivized industry practice. With implementation of the AIM act, proper refrigerant recovery of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) will be necessary to enable the transition to lower GWP refrigerant solutions and minimize harmful effects on the environment. To ensure proper recovery occurs, improvements in the recovery process are needed. Any methods of making the recovery process easier, faster and cheaper will increase the likelihood of proper refrigerant recovery. Systematic experimental evaluation will be used to quantify impacts on increasing the speed of the refrigerant recovery process for individual recovery machines typically used for residential and light commercial systems. Based on gathered data, possible solutions for recovery machine and/or process improvement will be identified.

However, available recycled feedstock only meets 25% of projected demand - inevitably leading to unsubstantiated claims about product recycled content and further erosion of consumer trust. Kamilo’s proposed innovative technology solution provides crucial components to plastic circularity: 1) a first-of-its-kind, 3rd party-verified digital product certificate for the percentage of recycled content in circular plastic products; and 2) the means to present that information on a ‘percentage recycled content’ digital product label that complies with Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requirements. Labeling is monitored during printing for accuracy and is linked to the history of the supply chain through the Kamilo Technology Platform. Smartphone-enabled features deliver clarity of sourcing for circular plastic products to consumers, delivering benefits for the Brands and product manufacturers. Supply chains are in urgent need of digital transformation. And plastic circularity demands measurement, traceability and reporting systems to verify how materials move throughout their lifecycles, especially from waste origination and recovery to next-life and back again. The proposed technology is highly feasible because it marries recycled plastic product manufacturing data with production facility recycled feedstock inventory data obtained from Kamilo’s geospatial technology platform for supply chain tracking and verification. The performance compared to current technologies will be transformative – today’s self-certification of recycled content is unreliable and the current 3rd party analog audit/certification methods are time-consuming, outdated, error-prone and easy to manipulate. A critical step to building circularity is increasing trust in the recycling system with demonstrable proof of claims made around use of recycled feedstock and recycled content in products. We anticipate that there are thousands of manufacturers and Brands that would welcome use of a verifiable percentage recycled content label on their products as a market differentiator and a signal to consumers of their contributions to circularity. We estimate that the market size for tracking and verification of sustainable outcomes combined with the digital verification confirming percentage of recycled plastic in individual products, just for plastic currently being recycled (<10% of plastic collected), is $500 million. Kamilo’s system also quantifies recycling’s prevention of plastic pollution and the avoidance of greenhouse gases (GHGs) associated with fossil fuel production and the manufacturing of virgin plastic.

Methane has 28 times greater heating capacity than carbon dioxide and its atmospheric concentration has increased roughly from 800 parts-per-billion (ppb) in the early 1900s to an alarming 1800 ppb in 2016. With approximately 3.2 million abandoned wells in the US, mitigating fugitive emissions was designated a high priority by the Biden administration.While we have ample satellite or tower data that provide global or point concentrations/flux of greenhouse gas emissions, we have little understanding of localized “topology” of emission and transport. Without that knowledge we do not know where our hidden carbon offenders lie and thus cannot mitigate leaks. Several COTS methane sensors in use can provide some information at scale on methane presence or information on concentration but they are fixed systems. They are not able to scale or be adaptive to varied terrain and operations, or to 3D mapping of intricate and complex topographies, with high resolution both of spatial characteristics as well as low methane concentrations. To address the issues mentioned above, through this SBIR effort, we offer the solution of remote sensing of fugitive methane using Retroreflector-Based Differential Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (DLAS) system on a UAV pair—termed our RetraSpectra™ system. Standalone DLAS systems based have demonstrated to be a reliable and accurate method of detecting low-concentration levels of fugitive gases. However, measurements without the use of a dedicated retroreflector are often noisy (function of the environment) and thus, cannot be scaled to measure larger columns of interest. Utilizing a DLAS on one UAV and a retroreflector on another UAV, larger spatial columns of fugitive leaks can be measured in significantly less time as compared to currently used manual methods. Another advantage of having a retroreflector on one of the UAVs is the dynamic scanning capability over areas of interest, as compared to having a stationary retroreflector. In Phase I, Censys Technologies Corporation aims to develop and demonstrate a proof-of-concept measurement of the novel measurement system whilst optimizing COTS components for use.

LeapFrog research aims to provide innovative decentralized water treatment for non-potable reuse and capture onsite for single-family residence scale. Across the country, growing demand for high-quality water is met with long term challenges due to drought, changing weather patterns, sea level rise, and water pollution. Current trends of increased water use have led to extreme water scarcity across most of the western United States. This rise in demand for water along with its increasing scarcity is causing unsustainable pressure on remaining fresh water resources. Furthermore, failure of existing wastewater infrastructure, specifically, decentralized wastewater treatment, is at unsanitary and unsafe levels. Failure rates in some states are as high as 50%, which will only increase as septic system use expands (Mohamed, 2009). Additionally, failed septic systems are one of the largest contributors of nutrient pollution in our waterways (Mallin, 2006). Currently, untreated and undertreated wastewater from failed septic systems and cesspools leaches into surface and groundwater, creating a toxic missed opportunity. Instead, we can elegantly transform this wasteful byproduct into clean water fit for reuse. We have learned from customer discovery that the septic upgrade market is underserved with shortages of equipment and prices that make retrofits out of reach for many households. Failed septic systems present severe pains for homeowners, with noxious odors, unusable landscaping, and significant risks to human health. Furthermore, when attempting to alleviate these customer pains with existing products, they are too expensive, hard to install, and unattractive. Wastewater can be captured and treated onsite for non potable reuse, reducing water pollution and extending water supply.With our ecological treatment technology, we meet this pent-up demand with the best onsite wastewater treatment reuse option that addresses known customer pain points and provides the performance they want—it costs less, is easier and quicker to install, has fewer maintenance requirements, uses less energy, and sequesters carbon—because we have rethought infrastructure to include ecology. That means we partner with the natural ecological systems found in wetlands to create the first internet-connected, modular ecological treatment technology.",  ,,,,Nicholas A Sund,Head of Product,(253) 905-4865,nicholas.sund@leapfrog.design,,  ,

Otitis media (OM) is experienced by five out of six children before their third birthday, and 30-40% suffer
recurring infections, leading to 16 million annual episodes in the US. Ear infections are the primary reason for
antibiotic prescription for children under 6 years, are the second most common cause of hearing loss, and can
lead to lifelong sequelae. Diagnosis depends upon in-person clinic visits and visual examination by care
providers, at great inconvenience to patients and caregivers and at significant cost to the healthcare system,
estimated at $4 billion per year. Although the majority of OM cases resolve within a week and symptoms may
be managed by over-the-counter medications,10-20% do not, requiring additional antibiotic treatment or, in
extreme cases, tympanostomy tube insertion to provide ventilation to the middle ear and aid in fluid drainage.
Another compounding factor is limited access to otolaryngologists for accurate diagnosis and infection
management. The expansion of telehealth has the potential to address this need with rapid, convenient, and
affordable, but to date, there are no platforms to support and facilitate effective virtual visits for OM diagnosis.
The first Specific Aim of this Phase I proposal involves building a comprehensive database of several thousand
images of eardrums from patients with or without acute OM, with associated clinical diagnostic labels to, in
Specific Aim 2, train a novel custom machine learning algorithm, Remmie.ai. A convolutional neural network
will be developed to classify images of eardrums paired with text description of symptoms. Image classification
will be improved through data augmentation, and the custom Remmie.ai architecture built through transfer
learning of a publicly available training model. Unblinded labels will be compared to the algorithm readout as
blinded testing data are loaded into Remmie.ai to ensure convergence of accuracy and validation for
classification of acute OM versus normal eardrums. In Specific Aim 3, the Remmie.at platform, coupled with a
handheld “portable otoscope” for imaging patients’ eardrums and a user-friendly mobile device application, will
be tested by end-user physicians to derive feedback on the usability of the device and software. The outcome
will be a novel tool for both patients and caregivers to monitor otolaryngic diseases, specifically acute OM,
based on patient-provided images and symptoms, and diagnosis, aided by the proprietary Remmie.ai
algorithm.",  ,,,,JANE  ZHANG,,(805) 338-8724,jane@remmiehealth.com,,  ,

The approach addresses challenges with safely performing gas conversion of potentially flammable substances and identifies new regenerative catalytic processes using Earth abundant metals for conversion of NIST and IAEA, 14C standards for parallel processing of 14CO2 reference material to 14CH4. If proven successful, the process could be used for high-throughput analysis of test samples from fugitive 14CH4 sources that differentiate fossil from modern carbon following ASTM D6866 standards. The gas conversion efficiency and isotope results will be assessed for quality assurance through repeated measurements of accuracy, precision, and isotope fractionation of hydrocarbon gases that have thus far, been difficult because they require gas chromatographic separation using solid phase support, which need to be assessed for carbon memory that could detrimentally affect accurate reporting of 14CH4. The R&D efforts will determine if the proof-of-concept design has the potential to meet the global customer demand for future emissions testing of 14CH4 fugitive sources in a high-throughput process. A strong commercialization opportunity has been identified in two markets, and customers identified from three years of customer inquiries and discovery suggest an immediate demand for ASTM D6866 analysis of elusive hydrocarbon gas samples. The proposed radiocarbon standardization is critical for developing robust isotopic methods for detecting and quantifying 14CH4. The results of this work have potential for future ISO 17025:2017 scope of accreditation for hydrocarbon gas conversion, which has proven to be a significant scientific challenge in most of the commercial radiocarbon laboratories.

An estimated 5.8 million American’s 65 years and older are suffering from AD, with that number projected to hit 13.8 million by 2050. Aging African American and Latinx populations are particularly hard-hit by AD/ADRD, as are rural communities due to lack of access to clinical trials and medical care. A broad range of symptoms are associated with these diseases and each patient’s progression is unique and clinically quite variable. During a clinical trial, when longitudinal studies are conducted over months to years, much of the patient’s lifestyle and function goes unmonitored as they are at home with their partner or alone and without contact with professional providers. Infrequent data collection relies on the ability of patients to accurately retrieve relevant details about their lives since the last checkup, which is inherently inaccurate or incomplete due to the challenges of self-report and recall. Thus, there is a critical need in clinical trials for more frequent, accurate, and complete patient monitoring especially in communities that are currently underserved. To meet this need, Life Analytics is furthering the development of an at-home monitoring platform, called Life Analytics Monitoring Platform (LAMP). LAMP is based off of the NIH and VA funded Collaborative Aging Research Using Technology (CART) initiative system. CART is an end-to- end (hardware and software) platform, which provides high-frequency monitoring of geriatric disease progression by measuring real-world data, thus providing a digital remote assessment model to the academic research community. The CART system was built by, and has been further developed by, our research team in the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology (ORCATECH). Through these efforts a highly functional generalizable infrastructure for support and deployment of these systems for academic research has been established. To date, the ORCATECH/CART platform has been installed in more than 1000 homes across North America and is currently collecting and transmitting data back to ORCATECH servers for analysis. Additionally, the LA team has shown through publication that high-frequency in-home monitoring data allows clinical studies to be appropriately powered with fewer patients. Therefore, this platform has the high potential to change the way that clinical trials are conducted – if such a system can broadly disseminated. This Fastrack will assist with the critical research and development required to improve the existing ORCATECH/CART platform into the commercialized LAMP platform through the following Aims: SA 1 (Phase I): Migrate ORCATECH/CART system to secure and scalable cloud operability. SA 2 (Phase II): Optimization of LAMP for data transfer, storage, and analysis. SA 3 (Phase II): Demonstrate LAMP usability with Alpha-testing with a third party, off-site location.

Recycling innovation for SAP waste presents a major opportunity to reduce raw material consumption and allow for significant cost savings to aluminum producers. A novel Two-Stage Alkaline Hydrometallurgical Recovery (T-SAHR) process is proposed enabling complete resource recovery and coincidental hydrogen production from SAP waste. The research in this SBIR Phase I proposal aims to accomplish previously unattainable levels of materials separation and hydrogen generation to pioneer domestic salt cake recycling. Current salt cake recycling technologies are insufficient for cost-effective recycling of SAP waste in the US, evidenced by over 95% of this material (over 1 million tons annually) going to landfill. Meanwhile, landfilling salt cake is an unsustainable option that creates a billion-dollar waste challenge for SAPs. The storage of SAP waste in landfill causes leachate, gas evolution, and potential explosion hazards (Tolaymat, T. and X. Huang, 2015). More than 100 customer interviews have shown a clear need for more cost-effective salt cake recycling options as well as an opportunity for waste products to be sold as a valuable alumina source for calcium-sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement if sufficient materials separation can be achieved. Hydrova’s proprietary T-SAHR salt cake recycling process could enable an increase in the degree of materials separation by 10x from the incumbent recycling processes while simultaneously increasing hydrogen productivity by 8x. Hydrogen generated from SAP waste can be used to dramatically increase the energy efficiency of the process. During his undergraduate work at MIT, PI Rostam Reifschneider along with co-founder Julian Davis developed an aluminum-water reaction-based method for encouraging hydrogen generation from aluminum that could enable increased hydrogen productivity during salt cake recycling. A Process Based Cost Model developed by Hydrova predicts that performing this T-SAHR process would provide up to a 30% ROI, introducing a clear economic incentive over landfill disposal. Phase I of this SBIR will de-risk the technology through characterizing parameter trade-offs, optimizing materials separation and hydrogen generation, and collaborating with SAP and CSA cement customers themselves.

To address consumer food waste, Imvela Corp. proposes to develop a novel, natural ingredient that reduces microbial spoilage and extends shelf life, when applied to berries after they are harvested. Our approach is innovative because we collect experimental data from a large, diverse set of naturally occurring organisms, and then use computational approaches to design novel microbial communities with synergistic properties. The power of this approach stems from our ability to rapidly explore a large design space (10s of thousands of organisms) and choose subsets of organisms with high performance properties. If awarded, we will comprehensively biobank key spoilage organisms from strawberry spoilage samples (TA1), develop and validate a screening assay compatible with key fungal spoilage organisms (SOs) that is predictive of the strawberry microenvironment (TA2), and screen our biobank for lead inhibitors of a range (at least 4) of key spoilage organisms, resulting in ~3-5 prioritized hits per spoilage organism (TA3). We expect the approach to be feasible since we have already validated our scientific platform through a patented Superculture ingredient called Monarck, and the ongoing development of a biopreservative solution for processed dairy products. A successful product will inhibit key strawberry spoilage organisms at least 25% more effectively than current solutions, with comparable dosing levels, similar pricing, and no impact on sensory or visual properties of the food. Unlike any other successful preservative on the market today, the product will be (1) clean label (i.e. natural) and not based on artificial chemicals (with the potential to be produced in an organic manner) (2) specifically designed for the strawberry microenvironment and strawberry SOs and (3) dependent on multiple mechanisms of action driving synergy and high performance in resulting spoilage prevention. Our direct customers will be post-harvest fresh produce processors and distributors and the product would ultimately help consumers prevent food waste through produce distribution to storage at home. The $1.5 billion biopreserve market indicates a high level of demand for such a product, and customer conversations have revealed that natural and clean label ingredients are a top priority.",  ,,,,Ravi U Sheth,Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer,(513) 470-5728,ravi@kingdomsupercultures.com,,  ,

Iterant has implemented an online reuse marketplace that provides economic incentives for key stakeholders involved in the manufacturing, use/reuse and recovery of plastic packaging. Our hypothesis, based on pilot data, is that this platform can deliver profitable reuse models for all three key stakeholders, and will be scalable and self-sustaining. The key innovation of the Iterant marketplace is a royalty payment mechanism available to packaging manufacturers whenever their products are transacted for reuse between third parties on the marketplace. These royalty payments can provide manufacturers with profits from reuse that equal those from single-use. Manufacturers are thus incentivized to support reuse of their products. A pro forma example demonstrating viable economics is included in the full proposal. The implementation of marketplace features is straightforward. Our challenge lies in demonstrating the ability of those who collect post-consumer packaging and process it for resale to run a profitable business while still providing savings for reusers and royalties for manufacturers. Hence the scope of work includes demonstration of process improvements in material handling and optimization of shipping logistics. Reuse out-performs single-use in both environmental and economic impact. We have demonstrated through a pilot project that resale of finished plastic packaging can command a 40x price premium over sale of the same bulk material as recycling input. This premium enables the new business model for materials management described above. We will focus on a specific plastic packaging product - an rHDPE can carrier used by a large number of craft breweries. This product is an excellent test case, as it is widely used and simple to collect and process. If we achieve 5% market share of can carriers among 230 local breweries, annual resale revenue of $93,812, aggregated brewery savings of $22,391, and manufacturer royalties of $5,465 will be generated.

These toxic vapors typically emanate from contaminated soil or groundwater such as Superfund sites. Currently, the US EPA lists 1,333 Superfund sites and 2,300 other locations, all potential sources of vapor intrusion, deserving of monitoring to avoid delirious health effects on humans utilizing the affected spaces. The US remediation market in 2019 was $80.5B. Long-term monitoring to confirm remediation effectiveness relies on several sampling techniques. To provide analytical data more frequently at substantially lower costs, Seacoast will develop a compact, autonomous, cost-competitive fieldable analyzer specifically tuned for chlorocarbons, carcinogens commonly found at Superfund and brownfield sites. The analyzer supports users of thermal desorption (TD) (EPA TO-17) and gas chromatography (GC) for identification and quantification of air toxics. This analyzer combines low-cost photoionization detectors, trap-and-purge TD-tube collectors, and the resolving power of Seacoast’s oven-less GC to (1) repeatedly collect and analyze air in its immediate environment, (2) provide reliable data, wirelessly, to a network for environmental site managers to use in plume tracking models, and (3) reduce per-sample costs by cycling, unattended, between sample collection, analysis, and calibration, over a period of days to months. The system will be remotely programmed and activated, to provide unattended room or building air monitoring for vapor intrusion, emissions, or leaks. The system will closely follow TO-17 for TD-tube air sampling and GC analysis, with accommodations for operation without compressed gas cylinders, making the system portable. TD also acts as a concentration amplifier allowing the system to achieve sensitivities ?0.5ppb of TCE or PCE, the EPA action level. An important innovation is the development of auto-calibration and purge validation. Protocols will be developed using a dedicated sample loop to allow the system to self-correct for detector drift and to detect impurities. The system will be inexpensive (<$7,500), compared to common laboratory instruments (e. g. GC/MS), and portable for easy setup. Thus, per-sample costs can be much lower than traditional, labor-intensive means of sample collection. Environmental remediators and IAQ investigators will have data to track concentrations several times a day, rather than weekly or monthly. Seacoast will work with Markes International to validate the Phase I prototype using their analytical labs. The analyzer provides the as-of-yet-unrealized concept of autonomous, unattended site monitoring to confirm success in site remediation.",  ,,,,William K Tolley,Principal Scientist,(760) 268-0083,Btolley@seacoastscience.com,,  ,

Air toxics pose a significant risk to public health and lower quality of life due to both acute and chronic health impacts. Therefore, there is a need for transportable, autonomous air toxic monitors that can identify and quantify toxic chemicals. However, the current state-ofthe-art monitors are not suitable for neighborhood-level surveillance due to their relatively high cost, and/or their lack of automation. Therefore, a relatively low-cost, autonomous unit is needed to quantify and identify chemical pollutants in neighborhoods at levels that meet or exceed EPA thresholds. To address this gap, this effort will miniaturize a state-of-the-art benchtop terahertz (THz) spectroscopy unit to fit within a pelican case, creating a unit that can be produced at a moderate cost (~$10,000 per unit at scale), autonomous device. THz spectroscopy can identify highly volatile air toxics that have a dipole moment based on the unique, multi-component rotational spectra; these unique features enable identification and quantitation even in complex mixtures at the ppm, ppb, and in some cases ppt levels. No commercial units exist leveraging THz spectroscopy for gas-phase monitoring and detection despite its advantages in resolution over other optical-based spectroscopic techniques and in cost over mass-spectrometry based techniques. Advancement in MEMS technology and components now make miniaturization, automation, and ruggedization practical for a transportable, autonomous unit. Therefore, this effort will miniaturize, autonomize, and ruggedize the benchtop unit and create a spectral library of select air toxics.This effort will provide a key autonomous monitoring tool for the identification of key pollutants both in the residential and the occupational space, providing a critical tool to both identify sources of pollution as well as to enable mitigation strategies. The end product also has commercialization value; the VOC gas sensor market is expected to be worth $186 million (M) by 2025. Initial markets will involve those most afflicted by the release and presence of air toxics and odors for identification and testing, but also to confined space occupations, first responders, chemical firms, oil and gas industry, and the DOD.

The proposal will extend and enhance Sepsis Watch to EDs, general inpatient wards, and intensive care unit (ICU) settings across multiple health systems in the United States. While early diagnosis and prompt treatment of sepsis can improve mortality and morbidity, early detection has remained elusive. The Sepsis Watch integration in the DUH ED improved compliance with the 3-hour sepsis bundle by 12% and the 6-hour sepsis bundle by 18%. The system reduced mortality for severe sepsis by 15% and mortality for septic shock by 22%. This proposal seeks to transform Sepsis Watch into a scalable solution to replicate such results at other health systems and in settings beyond the ED. In Phase I, we propose external validation through a retrospective analysis of data from two separate health systems. Phase 1 will let us automate data quality checks and ingestion processes at scale from different health systems as we curate data from at least 200,000 encounters over a 2-year period. We will present model predictions to clinicians from each hospital to analyze potential impact of integrating Sepsis Watch into clinical care. In Phase II, we propose conducting temporal validation at each hospital from Phase I. This will allow us to design real-time ingestion of data records into Sepsis Watch in a manner that is agnostic to electronic health record (EHR) vendor systems. We will optimize the machine learning model using Phase 1 findings to improve performance at each location while assessing federated and centralized learning approaches that incorporate data from different hospitals. Models variations that utilize different sets of inputs will also be assessed and models will be built to three gold-standard sepsis definitions, including Sepsis-3, CMS SEP-1 sepsis, and CDC Adult Sepsis Event. During the 6-month temporal validation we will also generalize the Sepsis Watch user-interface and workflow by seeking feedback from clinicians at each hospital as it is run in silent mode. This will allow Sepsis Watch to be configurable to various clinical workflows. The optimized model and user-interface in Phase 2 should allow Sepsis Watch to be seamlessly integrated into routine clinical care in each hospital and then into other hospitals within each of the two health systems and eventually to any health system in the US.",  ,,,,MANESH R PATEL,,9196814441,manesh.patel@duke.edu,DUKE UNIVERSITY,  ,

Two key technical challenges are addressed in this research. The first area has, as its main objective, the development of a volume-adaptable refrigeration system that allows for the efficient operation of several levels of control to best adapt to high levels of cooling capacity needs. The second area of research corresponds to the development of the methodology and solutions algorithms to exercise a hybrid control strategy for the optimal scheduling operation of the refrigeration system. The archetype refrigeration system would be subject to constraints imposed by the heterogeneous loads stored in the different special storage and transportation units known as mini-containers which receive cooling and other environmental services.This technology will allow for efficiently aggregating, storing, disaggregating, and distributing fresh products in the mini-containers. The mini-containers will allow the emergence of efficient cold logistics for small loads by enabling the capacity of large transportation containers to be split among multiple conveyances.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-L1/PD-1 are causing a paradigm shift in NSCLC treatment, yet the 5-year survival rate remains below 20%.  This Fast-Track SBIR application aims to develop a novel nano-immunotherapy (termed ARAC - Antigen  Release Agent and Checkpoint Inhibitor) that can greatly improve the efficacy of ICIs leading to curative  outcomes for NSCLC patients. ARAC is built upon our core nanoparticle platform capable of co-delivering multiple therapeutic agents, while keeping a small size in saline (100 nm), suitable for infusion and tumor  accumulation. The proposed ARAC-02 will co-deliver a polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1)-targeted therapy (volasertib), a PD-L1 antibody, and the immune-stimulant CpG. Volasertib 1) selectively kills cancer cells, 2) modulates the  immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment, and 3) upregulates PD-L1 expression in cancer cells, providing opportunity for targeted delivery with PD-L1 antibody on the nanoparticles. CpG is an oligonucleotide that  enhances antigen presentation to generate tumor-specific T cells. The nanoparticles contain a very high  surface density of PD-L1 antibodies (two thousand per particle), which promotes binding to PD-L1 molecules  on cancer cells, followed by internalization and PD-L1 degradation (as effective as 30-fold free PD-L1  antibody), releasing the brakes and allowing T cells to attack the cancer. When given intravenously to mice  bearing lung tumors, the nanoparticle co-delivering volasertib and PD-L1 antibody reduced the necessary dose  for efficacy of each drug by 5-fold. Adding CpG to the nanoconstructs triggers greater adaptive anti-cancer  immunity in a bilateral NSCLC mouse model, leading to complete cures for some mice. The platform was also  found to be safe in monkeys. In Phase I (Aim 1), ARAC-02 will be optimized for loading of volasertib, PD-L1 antibody, and CpG. Materials  will be screened for size, targeting specificity, efficacy in NSCLC cells, and efficacy and safety in mice. In Phase II, the pharmacokinetic, biodistribution, efficacy, and safety of the optimal ARAC-02 will be assessed,  both alone (Aim 2) and in combination with the current first-line immunotherapy (Aim 3). Clinically relevant  orthotopic NSCLC mouse models that are resistant to ICIs will be utilized, and findings will be validated in  humanized mice bearing two different patient-derived tumors that represent heterogeneous NSCLC in patients.  The free drugs, single-drug-loaded nanoparticles, and first-line immunotherapy will be used as benchmarks.  Due to its unique ability to stimulate various steps of the adaptive immune response, ARAC-02 is anticipated to  provide curative outcomes, especially when used with current ICIs for complete blockade. ARAC-02 can  upregulate PD-L1 levels thereby promoting efficacy in a broad range of tumor types regardless of baseline PD-L1 levels. Outcomes will be candidate selection and critical data towards an IND application and clinical trials.",  ,,,,WORAPOL  NGAMCHERDTRAKUL,,5034180483,worapol@pdxpharm.com,,  ,

CMTx Biotech is a drug development company working to rescue, develop and commercialize a proprietary
clinical-stage drug candidate, incyclinide (CMT-3 / COL-3), for the treatment of sepsis patients at risk of acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), at least 1.7
million American adults develop sepsis annually, resulting in nearly 270,000 deaths. Sepsis accounts for more
than 50% of hospital deaths, and mortality increases dramatically with greater disease severity: 10–20% for
sepsis, 20–40% for severe sepsis, and 40–80% for septic shock. Sepsis is a medical emergency characterized
by severe immune dysregulation with a very complex immunopathogenesis. ARDS is a devastating complication
of severe sepsis, both with similar underlying mechanisms characterized by inflammation and endothelial
dysfunction. Sepsis is the leading cause of ARDS and accounts for 32% of the etiology of the condition.
Approximately 6-7% of sepsis patients rapidly progress to ARDS, which is associated with a significantly
increased risk of in-hospital mortality. There is currently no specific treatment for sepsis-induced ARDS.
Moreover, researchers have not yet elucidated the multifactorial mechanisms by which sepsis induces ARDS,
or why the inflammatory cytokine storm eventually induces diffuse alveolar damage and severe hypoxia. Though
advances in treatment modalities have improved the outcome over recent decades, including lung protective
ventilation, prone positioning, use of neuromuscular blockade, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, the
mortality rate still remains high. There remains a critical unmet need for the development of safe and efficacious
therapeutics to prevent the onset of sepsis-induced ARDS, protect against lung injury and improve survival.
CMTx Biotech is working to develop and commercialize a novel and proprietary nanoformulation of incyclinide
(nCMT-3) that can be aerosolized, and which can be delivered to specifically target the lung and treat sepsis-
induced ARDS while limiting systemic toxicity. Incyclinide is a clinical-stage, non-antibiotic, chemically-modified
tetracycline that belongs to a class of pleiotropic matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) modulators which inhibit
pathologically-excessive collagenolysis and resolve systemic inflammation. Importantly, the safety of incyclinide
has already been demonstrated in Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies, and incyclinide has been
evaluated in a number of human clinical trials for the treatment of diseases as disparate as AIDS-related Kaposi’s
sarcoma, recurrent high-grade gliomas, refractory metastatic cancer, acne, rosacea and periodontitis. Published
pre-clinical efficacy studies have shown that systemic administration of incyclinide prevents the development of
ARDS and septic shock, and improves survival in several chronic insidious onset animal models of ARDS across
several species, including mice, rats, pigs, and sheep. Our long-term goal is to obtain regulatory approval from
the FDA and comparable international regulatory authorities to market aerosolized nCMT-3 for the treatment and
prevention of sepsis-induced ARDS. We strongly anticipate that nCMT-3 will inhibit disease progression, mitigate
acute lung injury and respiratory distress, reduce the need for intensive care and intubation, and improve clinical
outcomes for sepsis patients, including overall survival. Our specific aims are (a) to determine the
pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, and safety of aerosolized nCMT-3 in mechanically ventilated pigs with healthy
lungs, (b) to demonstrate the efficacy of aerosolized nCMT-3 in reducing the incidence and mortality of sepsis-
mediated ARDS in a high-fidelity, clinically applicable porcine sepsis-induced ARDS model, and (c) to
demonstrate the efficacy of aerosolized nCMT-3 at reducing local and systemic inflammation. Successful
completion of these studies will allow CMTx Biotech to advance nCMT-3 towards human clinical trials for the
treatment of ARDS patients.",  ,,,,MICHAELA C KOLLISCHSINGULE,,(315) 464-6308,kolliscm@upstate.edu,UPSTATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY,  ,

Using a modern, highly sensitive type of spectroscopy based on light scattering, and combining it with advanced statistical approaches (i.e., machine learning), this project is developing a method that can reliably detect biochemical changes in saliva specific to Alzheimer’s disease. This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by showing its ability to distinguish saliva donated by healthy individuals from saliva collected from Alzheimer's patients at both mild and moderate stages of the disease. The project will also investigate whether known biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease are being identified by this method and develop statistical approaches to interpret spectroscopic data._x000D_

Human activity related radiative forcing by methane accounts for about half of that caused by CO2. In the U.S., the largest industrial source of CH4 is oil and gas systems. Fugitive sources are often identified as potentially large sources of CH4 emissions; however, multiple measurement challenges inhibit more complete understanding of methane emissions. New measurement technologies that address these challenges and provide continuous quantitative CH4 emission rates are needed to increase the number of measurement data points available across multiple locations and source types to improve characterization of methane emissions. Mesa Photonics proposes to develop a rugged, sensitive, and selective optical methane monitoring technology. The compact, lightweight and low-power instrument will be designed specifically to target the primary EPA application of continuous monitoring of methane emissions under harsh conditions over oil and natural gas systems. Multiple sensors will be networked, and methane emission rates will be measured from concentration gradients across the network and possibly from adding wind speed data. The methane monitoring network will be capable of long-term unattended operation. Our approach has important advantages over existing methods for continuous methane monitoring such as exceptional ruggedness of the CH4 monitoring unit, high dynamic range, reduced calibration requirements, self-diagnostic capability and a relatively low price tag. The low power draw will allow battery and solar powered operation. The major commercial application of the proposed technology is detection and quantifying emissions of natural gas in oil and gas industry. Mesa Photonics will manufacture the methane monitors as an OEM supplier to one or more leak detector and repair (LDAR) service companies serving the U.S. oil and gas industry.

While food waste is generated at all stages of the food supply chain over 50% of all food waste is generated at the consumption stage, the majority of which occurs within households. Often, this waste occurs due to lack of consumer knowledge of available food, leading to stored food products ultimately spoiling in the fridge. Recognizing this issue, Wisely Food Storage is developing a smart food storage system that aims to reduce household food waste by allowing users to track the time and conditions under which their perishables have been stored. The proposed system consists of a food storage container equipped with a Wisely smart sensor that collects and displays food storage data. Data is displayed with an OLED screen to provide immediate feedback and metrics to users about food quality; through integrated Wi-Fi connectivity more detailed personalized insights and nudges are made available through the mobile Wisely companion app. The Wisely companion phone app is designed to help consumers with awareness, planning, and inventory management by providing new levels of food visibility—consumers can remotely track food stored in the smart Wisely storage containers as well as their conditions that they are stored in. In addition to visibility, our system will also provide app notifications that are triggered by certain conditions to make consumers aware of their food and risks of it spoiling, and to “nudge” them to take actions that will prevent food waste. The proposed technology goes beyond traditional food labeling by giving consumers detailed insights of their stored food from any location at any time. Proposed work in this project includes development of a companion mobile smartphone application and incorporation of additional sensor units to the Wisely prototype. Technical feasibility of Wisely’s approach will be established through a food waste consumer study. The study will aim to test two hypotheses: 1) Using the Wisely device and app increases consumer food waste awareness and 2) The Wisely device and app decreases leftover waste in consumer households. Successful completion of this work aims to establish the viability of Wisely’s approach and create a strong foundation to build off of for commercialization in Phase II.",  ,,,,Rachelle  McCray Driscoll,CEO,(602) 301-8452,rm@wiselyfoodstorage.com,,  ,

ANGELA BLVD.,,SOUTH BEND,Indiana,46617-1364,"a. Innovativeness of the proposed technology Forever Analytical Services (FAS) has developed particle-induced gamma-ray emissions (PIGE) spectroscopy for the high-throughput screening of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in water. This proposal seeks to extend the utility of this technique to the field by developing a field-deployable solid phase extraction (SPE) device containing a filter. Filters are then placed in an accelerated beam of protons where the resulting gamma-rays are measured to determine total fluorine content. PIGE is the only spectroscopic method for total fluorine analysis, which is rapid, quantitative, and sensitive. b. Technical feasibility compared to current technologies Rinsing a SPE filter with methanol and performing a second rapid PIGE measurement will distinguish inorganic fluoride from organofluorine. Limit of detection (LOD) is volume dependent, and since the SPE is performed in the field, larger sampling volumes can be used to lower the LOD below that of other existing total organic fluorine quantification methods such as combustion ion chromatography (CIC). Filters can be eluted to provide species information for select samples of interest. To date the FAS SPE/PIGE process has been demonstrated in the laboratory under controlled conditions. c. Commercial potential (applications and end users) This field-deployable SPE/PIGE method will provide regulatory agencies, PFAS-impacted communities, and environmental end-users with a fast and reliable method for screening for the presence of PFAS prior to speciation. This technique does not attempt to replace existing EPA methodologies, but rather to provide additional total organic fluorine screening information that is collected on-site in known areas of contamination for improved decision making. Given the widespread environmental contamination of our waters with PFAS, we anticipate that any tool that can screen samples more quickly and allow an end-user to select where to analyze in detail for specific PFAS will provide significant long-term cost savings. d. Potential for environmental feedback The SPE device paired with PIGE will allow on-site sampling for PFAS characterization more quickly and allow better-guided decision making for environmental remediation efforts. This technology will screen out samples that do not have significant PFAS and save money spent on the unnecessary analysis of clean water samples. Lastly, this device will provide environmental agencies information about the presence of all PFAS, not just regulated species. This is of increasing environmental interest and a precautionary approach to take, when coupled with the development of SPE methods proposed here to select the PFAS of most concern.",  ,,,,Hunter T MacMillan,Chief Executive officer,(610) 810-8375,huntermacmillan@fasanalytical.com,,  ,

Preventing Microplastics from getting into waterways or removing it once it is there, is the mission of EPA’s Trash Free Waters program and, as the production of plastics continues to grow, EPA is looking for innovative technologies to efficiently detect and quantify microplastics in support of environmental monitoring and removal processes. An ideal technology would rapidly and inexpensively characterize environmental samples of microplastics in environmental matrices, such as water, wastewater, or soil, and utilize artificial intelligence or other methods to automate rapid (sub second) classification, identification, and quantification of microplastic plastics. A detection technology that supports low-cost integration with a number of platforms to a number of use cases, including remote field monitoring, handheld point of use assessments, and lab scale rapid throughput sample measurement, would be highly advantageous. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI), where imaging and spectral scanning are combined to provide spatially represented spectral information, is emerging as a non-destructive, real-time detection tool for industrial and environmental sensing and inspection processes. High equipment costs, low data throughput, and operational complexity make such systems largely inaccessible and impractical for wide use. It would be a transformational step if inexpensive, highspeed, continuous-range hyperspectral (350-2600nm) measurement systems could be implemented in microplastic measurement utility enhancing form-factors. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to realize such a hyperspectral measurement system, implementing machine learning algorithm on hardware, by utilizing a novel optical system designed using a set of low-cost components to achieve cost, size, and performance goals. The Phase I effort will focus on: an in-depth study of how the technology can and should be adapted for portable and high throughput, microscopy-based scanning microscopy in target use cases; image and spectral ML algorithm evaluation; detailed design development; and experimental testing/demonstration of modified measurement hardware/firmware with relevant materials targets.

Litter applied raw, dried, or composted can negatively impact the environment and is impractical and unhealthy to transport long distances. C&G technology converts raw poultry litter to a superior, valuable, nutritionally balanced fertilizer significantly enhanced in nitrogen and sulfur through a simple process using readily available raw materials. The resulting EEF is safe for land application and transport. Technical Feasibility: The C&G technological process is simple, utilizing small, modular plants (Phase II), leading to reduced costs, affordable product for the consumer, and allowing plants to be built near existing poultry operations. The process is energy efficient and recycles limited resources with no loss of nutrients while protecting the environment from the spread of waste-borne disease and drug residue. Performance Comparison: C&G’s EEF and technology result in a net reduction of nutrient losses (nitrogen and especially phosphorus) to the environment via leaching, runoff, ammonia volatilization, and nitrous oxide emissions compared to conventional fertilizers. The C&G process is superior to current anaerobic digestion in the following ways: it reduces greenhouse gas emissions, increases cost-effectiveness in both capital and operational costs, simplifies production processes, eliminates drug residues from the starting litter, and successfully eliminates the harmful bacterial population normally present in manure fertilizers. Commercial Potential: C&G fertilizer provides the market with a versatile poultry litter-based product rich in naturally occurring primary, secondary, and micronutrients that can be used in any environment. The fertilizer works with existing fertilizers and equipment, is available in various particle sizes, and has excellent storage capabilities. Environmental Impact: Using untreated manures can have far-reaching negative environmental impacts, including exposure to pathogens and drug residues, release of greenhouse gases, water pollution, and nutrient buildup in waterways and estuaries. Through a well-designed strategy, manure fertilizers can solve many issues confronting the agricultural industry such as reducing soil degradation and improving fertility, increasing carbon reserves, and accelerating the cycles of key elements. The C&G EEF process improves the environment by preventing phosphorus buildup and protecting from litter contaminants while requiring no fossil fuels and producing no harmful emissions.

Alzheimer’s Disease is associated with metabolic dysfunction, glucose and insulin resistance, oxidative stress,
mitochondrial dysfunction, and reduced exercise capacity. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction
correlate with the development of beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposits, one of the hallmarks of AD that begin years before
the onset of memory and cognitive decline. Moreover, patients with AD have a reduced lifespan. Accordingly, it
would be beneficial to examine novel models of healthful longevity with enhanced metabolism, glucose and
insulin tolerance, exercise capacity, and protection against oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and
apoptosis. All these features are present in the adenylyl cyclase type 5 (AC5) knock out (KO) mouse, which
exhibits healthful longevity, associated with all major molecular factors that protect against AD. Adenylyl cyclase
(AC) induces cyclic AMP (cAMP) and, therefore, regulates sympathetic control and β-adrenergic receptor (β-
AR) signaling, and is thus a key regulator of health and longevity in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals.
AC5 is one of ten AC isoforms and is expressed in virtually every organ in the body, including the brain. In
support of its role in aging, we have found that disruption of AC5 (AC5 KO) promotes healthful longevity,
enhances exercise performance and protects against diabetes and heart failure, all of which should be helpful
in protecting against Alzheimer’s Disease. Our preliminary data also show that AC5 KO mice perform better on
memory and motor tasks compared to wild-type mice. In contrast, the Alzheimer model J20 mice, a transgenic
animal that overexpresses mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APP), exhibits memory loss as expected.
A pharmacological inhibitor of AC5 is the goal for clinical translation. We have developed a pharmacological
inhibitor of AC5, which is known as C90, as the lead candidate for the inhibition of AC5 targeting myocardial
ischemia. C90 leads to robust inhibition of AC5, has high solubility and readily absorbed orally. It showed efficacy
in animal models of exercise and myocardial ischemia. The main drawback with C90 is the presence of a
hydroxamic acid group. Hydroxamates are associated with adverse effects and are often mutagenic. The
mutagenicity of the hydroxamate group is proposed be due to its rearrangement to isocyanate which act as
alkylating agents of DNA. The goal of this application is to design and synthesize a novel C90 that would retain
the biological activity of C90, but devoid of the toxic liability of a hydroxamic acid group.",  ,,,,STEPHEN F VATNER,,(973) 972-8920,vatnersf@rutgers.edu,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",  ,

There is growing interest in non-potable reuse of septic tank effluent, yet existing disinfection methods are either costly (e.g., UV) or require households to handle hazardous chemicals (e.g., chlorine tablets). This project will validate a promising septic tank technology that enables low-cost, chemical-free disinfection of domestic wastewater for on-site non-potable reuse. The main innovation of the proposed technology is that it utilizes microbes and electricity to generate a disinfectant in situ. The technical feasibility of this technology has been validated in lab settings, and will be further validated on real-world wastewater in this project. Compared to current technologies, the proposed technology is expected to achieve similar treatment performance (i.e., meeting the NSF/ANSI 350 on-site reuse standard), but has the advantages of being easier and safer to operate, and being more adaptable to the conditions in rural areas. The envisioned market for this technology is households and small buildings, in sparsely populated areas and in states where non-potable reuse of septic tank effluent is widely adopted (e.g., Louisiana and Mississippi). An in-depth market research will be completed in this project. The proposed technology is expected to outperform current technologies in terms of life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions, benefitting from the electrified nature. A detailed environmental life cycle assessment will be computed to confirm its environmental performance in this project.",  ,,,,Cassandra  Carpio,Senior Research Engineer,(860) 576-0583,Jtech.environ@gmail.com,,  ,

As the hazardous limits of some of these toxins are as low as the 1 part-per-trillion (ppt) range, very sensitive analytical techniques are required. A variety of techniques exist, but they are expensive, laboratory-based, time-consuming and may not detect all the toxic analytes. For thorough testing of a wide variety of water sources and rapid protection of the populace, a portable, inexpensive, real-time water analyzer is required. A technique that is adaptable and can identify a potential hazard from an unexpected component would be ideal. In this program, the technique of Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) will be used to simultaneously measure a wide variety of contaminants in the field at the low concentration levels anticipated. SERS is an enhanced spectroscopic technique with the capabilities to detect into the sub-ppt concentration range. EIC has successfully employed a portable SERS spectrometer for pesticide detection in the drinking water supply, on dwelling surfaces, in the urine of, and in the air surrounding North Carolina farmworkers. Herein, the technique will be extended and optimized for contaminants besides pesticides and optimized for a variety of water supplies. Rapid collection and concentration of contaminants will be accomplished using SERS-active gold or silver nanoparticles with a magnetic core. The colloids are thoroughly mixed with the water sample and then collected by a magnet to optimize analyte preconcentration. Sensor optimization in terms of SERS sensitivity and optimal mixing conditions will be addressed during the Phase I program. Additional issues such as sensor contamination, aggregation, and mixture analysis will be evaluated using a set of representative analytes and water samples. Phase II will 1) extend the analyte library, 2) optimize portability and sensitivity, 3) optimize software for acquisition, analysis (including principal component analysis and partial least squares protocols), and quantification and 4) perform analyses on water samples from known contaminated sites. This program will provide a commercial portable SERS analyzer for non-specialist usage that is capable of detecting >100 analytes at EPA-desired concentration limits in real time.",  ,,,,Kevin M Spencer,Sr. Scientist,(781) 769-9450,spencer@eiclabs.com,,  ,

Petroleum-derived colorants used in consumer goods are of particular concern due to their toxicity profile, persistence, and tendency to leach into the environment. As more companies make the switch to bio-based/biodegradable plastics, greater access to bio-based dyes will be needed to enable the production of brightly colored bioplastics with no risk of environmental or human toxicity. Ourobio seeks to address this market opportunity by turning cheap, readily-available industrial byproducts into biodegradable pigments and a biodegradable polymer simultaneously. Our technology is unique in its ability to turn waste whey into non-toxic colored biodegradable plastic - also known as a masterbatch - in a single-step fermentation process, saving significant energy costs and water usage in comparison to typical masterbatch preparation. Ourobio (Transfoam LLC) was inspired by our founders' work on the 2019 UVA iGEM project and was spun out in March 2020 with the goal of reducing microplastic pollution and barriers to biodegradable plastic production. Building upon recent studies, Ourobio has shown that indigo (unmodified) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) can be co-produced from whey and that the two products can be co-extracted. Using SBIR Phase I funds, Ourobio will complete two objectives to demonstrate i) organic indigoid compounds will be biosynthesized from tryptophan in parallel with PHB production; and ii) PHA and indigoid compounds will be co-extracted to produce high-performance, biodegradable masterbatches. After benchtop validation, demonstration of our ability to produce multi-colored masterbatches on a larger scale (10 - 15L) will be performed in collaboration with Pow.bio, and material general in these runs will be tested alongside the Heritage Research Group. Ourobio will position itself as a manufacturer of specialty/colored biodegradable plastic masterbatches and licensor of our specialty biomanufacturing technologies. Achieving these objectives will position Ourobio to begin delivering commercial pilot volumes of material to our first customers. As indicated in our letters of intent, we plan to source whey from Meadow Creek Dairy and work with Helian polymers to compound our masterbatches into high-performance dyed PHA compounds for the $3B biodegradable plastics industry. Successful implementation of our technology will help the biodegradable plastic industry offer a more appealing and wider selection of low-footprint, fully-biodegradable plastic products, and will contribute to improved access to PCB- and heavy metal-free biodegradable plastic dyeing agents.",  ,,,,Kobe C Rogers,Chief Operating Officer,(512) 636-9003,krogers@ourobio.com,,  ,

More than 90% of professional applications are created using open source components. Furthermore, open source software often comprises 70%+ of the code in any modern application. As software supply chain security makes front page news with the SolarWinds breach impacting multiple US federal agencies and departments, it is more important than ever that application development teams employ a comprehensive approach for managing the open source components that make up their applications. With the advent of programs like Platform One’s DoD Enterprise DevSecOps Services, that new reality is facing DoD application developers as well. DoD application development teams are already exposed to potential compromise by adversary teams through the open source packages they’re using today. Unmanaged third-party open source packages present a clear and immediate supply chain risk at all levels—potentially leading to a catastrophic loss of command and control systems in warfighting situations and a total mission compromise. Tidelift is the largest provider of commercial support and maintenance for community-led open source libraries and packages. By partnering with independent project maintainers through Tidelift, the DoD will get a safe, easy, and cost-effective approach to managing open source components. The Tidelift managed open source solution delivers customizable catalogs of software supply chain components that are actively maintained, secure, and accurately licensed, enabling developers to build and deploy faster and with confidence. Research demonstrates that the big three support challenges for open source software are: Maintenance - Guarantees that the packages they use are maintained Security - Protection from security issues Licensing - Open source license management Without a managed solution, DoD development teams face productivity drains, exposure to adversary attacks through unpatched security vulnerabilities, and intellectual property risks. For the military, assuming responsibility for the maintenance of mission-critical, open source-based systems and applications can be challenging because of the long lifespans of the systems involved and the sheer effort required. Unfortunately, support may not always be readily available. For example, personnel often believe that “somebody out there” can help them address security issues as they arise – when this may not be the case. Open source community members aren’t on call 24/7 and do not deliver service level agreements to users. Fortunately, external vendors can help. Crucially, external vendors can also provide support, taking on responsibility for the open source maintenance piece – thereby enabling military IT to focus on higher-level activities that directly support the mission. -Military Embedded Systems: Harnessing open source innovation in the military with rock-solid security, Nov 2019",Sergey N Bratus,Program Manager,(571) 218-4428,sergey.bratus@darpa.mil,Donald  Fischer,,(617) 528-9673,dff@tidelift.com,,  ,
