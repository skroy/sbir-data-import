The MTE technology implements on the fly changes to the sequence and structure of digitally transmitted data; every time the data is queued for transmission. We do this through the installation of the MTE protocol on each endpoint of the communication pipeline. The MTE â€œmethodsâ€ ensure and facilitate understanding of each data transmission. Actual transmission can take place utilizing communications protocols, including IP-based networks, SATCOM, Cellular, and others (e.g. Victory Systems Integration Lab and or Automotive OEM equivalent) within the global information grid. Current technology and threat environment require our defenses to be 100% effective. MicroToken Exchange smashes this paradigm by making the data if intercepted, near impossible to use or understand. MTE is equally effective at securing simple commands or more massive, more complex sets of data, including live video.

This is particularly problematic when one is interested in the three-dimensional structure of the area of interest. 3D models reconstructed from 2D electro-optical (EO) images can provide a fairly complete model of a region but the number of observations needed and 360-degree coverage required make repeated observations of a A2/AD environment impractical. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) excels at collected data from standoffs, but 3D models constructed from SAR tend to be sparse since the radar signal often scatters away from the receiver due to the local geometry or is absorbed depending on the target material. Kitware and Ohio State University propose to develop novel algorithms to fuse 3D models generated with EO and SAR data to provide robust 3D models of a region of interest. These models allow for accurate 3D change detection with only one initial EO data collection but repeated SAR data collections.

Cislunar missions provide opportunities for monitoring, communication, and navigation. Their chaotic nature from lunar and solar effects make some cislunar trajectories ideal responsive orbits, enabling relatively quick relocation with minimal propellant.

system. If left untreated, HIV-1 infected individuals will progress to AIDS and may ultimately die as a result.
Combination antiretroviral therapy is extremely effective at stopping the replication of HIV-1 in infected
individuals. Despite the success of this therapy at suppressing HIV-1 replication to clinically undetectable levels,
antiretroviral therapy is not curative. This is due to the persistence of HIV-1 in a silent, or latent, state within a
subset of CD4+ T cells known as resting memory CD4+ T cells. In this latent state, these infected cells are not
targeted by antiretroviral drugs and cannot be eliminated by the immune system. In HIV-1 infected individuals,
latently infected CD4+ T cells are found at extremely low frequencies (~1 per million resting memory CD4+ T
cells), with the majority found within immune tissues at any given time. This population of latently infected cells
is very stable, demanding that HIV-1 infected individuals remain on antiretroviral therapy indefinitely to avoid
rebound of viremia. As such, this population of latently infected CD4+ T cells is the main barrier to curing HIV-1
infection.Developing strategies to eliminate latently infected cells is a major focus of the NIH, NIAID, and the HIV-
1 research field. SIV and/or SHIV infected macaques are a critical non-human primate model for studying HIV-
1 persistence and testing novel therapeutic approaches. To effectively demonstrate the efficacy of candidate
therapeutics targeting the latent reservoir in these animals, we must be able to measure the frequency of latently
infected cells using rapid and accurate assays that can be scaled for widespread use, are amenable to analyzing
both peripheral blood and processed tissues, and can be translated to human clinical studies. Accelevir
Diagnostics, LLC is therefore working with the Siliciano lab at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine to developing
SIV and SHIV adapted intact proviral DNA assays (IPDA) and corresponding controls for use in these critical
animal studies. Broadly, the proposal aims to develop and characterize novel cell line controls for the SIV IPDA
and SHIV IPDA, qualify the performance of the SIV IPDA and SHIV IPDA, and perform initial evaluation of the
IPDA as a pharmacodynamic biomarker in SIV/SHIV infected macaque studies of curative interventions.PROJECT NARRATIVEFor HIV-1 infected individuals on suppressive antiretroviral therapy, latent HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells
is the major barrier to a cure. Elimination of these latently infected cells by is being pursued as a strategy to
cure the infection, and rhesus macaque models of latent HIV-1 infection that employ SIV and SHIV are critical
to preclinical development. This proposal details the development and optimization of SIV and SHIV versions of
a molecular assay to measure the number of latently infected cells present in biological samples for use in
monitoring the efficacy of candidate cure therapies.",  ,,,,GREGORY M LAIRD,,(417) 766-1246,greg.laird@accelevir.com,,  ,

Currently, circuits are interconnected using â€œbump bondingâ€, which requires indium bumps on opposing circuit faces to be precisely aligned then melted together using pressure and heat rather than needing an additional underfill process.

Such agility requires readied equipment with minimal administrative prepping so as to deploy and engage the target quickly and efficiently, in only a matter of seconds, and without having to relinquish their weapons. Our product responds to a notable capability gap with its simplicity, autonomy, and tactical effectiveness, allowing the Air Force end-user to understand the battlespace in a less exhaustive and more complete way.",Chris  Benson,,(801) 586-5761,afsbirsttr-info@us.af.mil,Mark  Foley,Principal Investigator,(703) 517-7034,mark@cktechnologies.io,,  ,

Traditionally Radio Frequency (RF) based wireless communication would be used in these scenarios. However, these RF waves can potentially affect critical radio communication between the airplane and ground. Electro Quasi-Static Human Body Communication (EQS-HBC), which uses the body as a conducting medium for communication, can be utilized as a potential alternative method in this scenario. Using high impedance capacitive termination at the receiver end it is possible to utilize the body as a wire in EQS-HBC. This wire-like behavior enables the confinement of the signal within the body. As a result, any communication from the wearable device has no effect on the radio communication between the airplane and ground, enabling applications like pilot monitoring. In Phase-I of this project we want to evaluate the feasibility and understand the design requirements of a EQS-HBC based pilot monitoring system in a heavily instrumented airplane cockpit environment.

Quantum computer technology based on topological qubits is inherently stable and resistant to errors because it exploits local topological symmetries and global boundary conditions of chalcogenide materials to yield unique, emergent quantum cooperative signatures. Wake Forest University and Streamline Automation have been working collaboratively for the last five years to develop practical applications for these topological chalcogenide materials. Our technology relies on topological complexity that yields charge-parity (CP) protected states. These states are â€œinteractedâ€ to yield stable entanglement. In this Phase I we propose to wire-bond several topological qubit nanoplatelets to produce the worlds-first topological qubit register. A register is the basic addressable element of a computer.

Alphacore partners are internationally recognized experts - Prof. Joe Campbell (University of Virginia) and consultant Prof. Seth Bank (University of Austin at Texas) - known for pioneering contributions to high-speed, low-noise avalanche photodiodes (APDs) used in optical communication systems. Alphacoreâ€™s technique combines the advantages of the two conventional APD operations: Geiger-mode APDs providing single photon sensitivities and linear mode APDs producing a signal proportional to the number of incident photons providing intensity image information. The goal is to dynamically bias the APD such that the charge carriers are speed-controlled and multiply inside of the avalanche region so that their probability of impact ionization as a function of time is maximized. The APDâ€™s gain (and excess noise factor) is manipulated so the signal to noise ratio (at a specific wavelength and bandwidth) can be optimized.

Ease of riblet application and robustness of the riblets during flight and maintenance have been two obstacles to the adoption of riblets for drag reduction in the military and commercial fleets. Assuming these obstacles are addressed, optimization of riblet designs is needed so that the drag reduction is maximized. To optimize riblet designs, means of fabricating and testing new riblet designs are needed. We propose to develop means of testing riblets in a low-speed wind tunnel in order to evaluate different designs using a riblet assessment protocol (RAP). To enable this, we must first identify ways to fabricate riblet designs suitable for testing in low-speed wind tunnels and to develop means of measuring any drag reduction realized by these designs. Key to this effort is the development of an elastomeric balance capable of the milli-newton measurements required for measuring the decrease in drag realized by novel riblet designs.

Time-resolved unsteady pressure measurement at a large number of ports (on the order of 100s) with high accuracy and high reliability during wind tunnel and flight test applications has been historically a challenging issue for instrumentation engineers. Pressure scanners are robust and cost-effective instruments for acquiring unsteady pressure measurements. However, the pneumatic distortion (lag, attenuation, and resonance) due to the tubing between the sensing module and surface port limits the usefulness of such measurements. This distortion reduces the accuracy of the measurements when unsteady aerodynamics are of concern.

It would also be impractical and cost-prohibitive to have satellites under 500 kgs carry high power thrusters to perform the necessary maneuvers. The most economical approach to fast, low-cost deployment of small satellite constellations is to use a low-cost satellite shuttle service to complete satellite plane transfers and other orbital adjustments once the launch vehicle has reached low-earth orbit (LEO) or medium-earth orbit (MEO). Momentusâ€™ low-cost Satellite Shuttle Service could more than halve the CAPEX required to launch and maintain LEO constellations.

These multiplexed images contain image information from several points in time, which can be separated computationally. Furthermore, MUSIC can essentially bypass the speed limits of electronic and/or mechanical shutters in the high-speed cameras since the encoding is done optically.

SL-FBG differ from C-FBG in their refractive index modulation gradient, which occurs over the same typical length (~5 mm) but is 2 orders of magnitude stronger. As a result, light is not simply reflected by the SL-FBG, but travels back and forth through it multiple times as if within a micro-resonator. This yields dramatic sensitivity gains over C-FBG, enabling measurement of critical jet engine parameters and ultra-fine flight control surface pressures. Furthermore, SL- and C-FBGs can be combined to cover complementary sensitivity requirements across different vehicle structures.

Sensor network based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems have the potential to provide real-time and historical sensor based data on the integrity of any structural platform requiring inspection and maintenance. SHM systems when used as ground support equipment (GSE) can reliably detect, localize and quantify damage in components. These GSE system are especially beneficial in structures and areas that are hard to access and require disassembly. Using current SHM systems as a basis, Acellent proposes a program for qualification and transition of SHM based Ground Support Equipment for the in-situ ground inspection/monitoring of metal or composite structures on USAF aircraft, spacecraft and unmanned platforms. Phase I will focus on identification of USAF platforms and customers who can utilize the SHM GSE tool to avail of the inspection cost benefits in collaboration with the Boeing Company.",Jared  Evens,,,sttr@afwerx.af.mil,Amrita  Kumar,Executive Vice President,(408) 307-4189,akumar@acellent.com,,  ,

In its September report â€œTop 25 Most Dangerous Software Errorsâ€, MITRE identified the highest-ranking weakness as CWE-119, buffer overflow. In response to these pervasive and often exploited memory corruption vulnerabilities, RunSafe Security launched Alkemist in 2018, an automated software transformation tool that hardens code from these types of attacks via a moving-target-defense approach. Rather than hunt down obscure, hard to find bugs, Alkemist removes the underlying construct in software that makes these attacks viable. Our tool is TRL 8 in the commercial market, with implementations and trials on-going with Vertiv, Avocent, Bosch, Samsung and Qualcomm. Our tool is TRL 6 in the DoD market, with initial implementations with NAVWAR and NAVAIR. In this Phase 1, RunSafe investigates: (1) the feasibility of automatically applying Alkemist to cyber-harden Docker images within Air Force CI/CD pipelines and (2) the impacts hardening has on metrics such as build time, load time, and memory overhead.",Chris  Benson,,(801) 586-5761,afsbirsttr-info@us.af.mil,Shane  Fry,"Director, Security Engineering",(256) 682-8423,shane@runsafesecurity.com,,  ,

Catalyst reactor beds must vaporize water and catalyze the propellant constituents in temperatures ranging from 300 Â°C to 1850 Â°C without losing structural stability or catalytic reactivity due to sintering, attrition, or depletion of active materials. Current state of the art catalysts are commonly made from granular ceramic carriers that are impregnated with various platinum group metals to increase activity. Ceramic beds do not have the necessary structural strength at high temperatures and will sinter rapidly above 1550 Â°C. Over time, sintering generates voids inside the bed which often result in negative effects such as increased thrust roughness, channeling of propellant through the bed, and repacking of the bed. These effects may result in the loss of the thruster or severely limiting the lifetime of the propulsion system. Additively manufactured, monolithic metallic foam catalyst reactor beds can replace granules for green monopropellant thrusters. High temperature materials and innovative designs will provide game changing results on various size thrusters currently in development.

This is a generational reduction in sound! Battle Born Supply Co.â€™s thesis regarding suppressors is that they must solve four major problems with todayâ€™s swath of silencers. First, sound reduction must be increased via a major leap derived from new technology not simply by the relatively small reductions weâ€™ve seen over the past two decades. Second, suppressors should be modular enough to change sound signatures on the fly, confusing the enemies of the United States and allowing our armed forces every advantage over them. Third, suppressors should have longer lifespans than the 10,000 - 30,000-round effective lifespans that are seen in the market currently.

based single-cell molecular profiling technology for in situ multiplexed quantitative molecular characterization of
biological specimens with optical imaging resolution. Despite the availability of Qdots commercially since early
2000s, they have not received broad adoptions and enabled biological discoveries, although they offer much
better optical properties than organic fluorophores. Key problems include the modest improvement in
multiplexing, and the sophisticated, lengthy, cost-prohibitive, and low-reproducibility probe preparation
approaches developed to date. Based on a breakthrough made by Prof. Gao’s lab (Nat. Commun.), the
technology proposed here is capable of solving both problems (patent recently awarded, ready for
commercialization). It simultaneously achieves the multiplexing capability of mass spectrometry (10s-100s) and
the sensitivity, resolution, in situ imaging, low cost, great accessibility (microscopes are standard compared to
mass spectrometers) of immunofluorescence.Narrative
This project is aimed to develop and commercialize an innovative versatile quantum dot-based imaging
technology for highly multiplexed, high-resolution, in situ analysis of single cells. Success in producing such a
powerful imaging tool will allow future collaborations and services for pharmaceutic companies to develop
advanced immunotherapies and companion diagnostic kits.",  ,,,,HONGYAN  LIU,,(503) 956-5302,hongy.liu@yahoo.com,,  ,

Several critical components on the Triton UAS have been designed as rib-to-skin bonded composite joints, such as the main wing box, V-tail and aft-fuselage structure.

The proposed technology would be integrated into the UAS structural assembly to provide real-time or on-demand feedback on the integrity of these bonded joints, therefore enabling condition based maintenance (CBM) to extend manual inspection out by many flights. Northrop has calculated that if implemented fleet-wide, this technology will save as much as $1B in inspection and preventative maintenance costs over the life of the fleet, in addition to ~5-10% more asset availability.

from a seated position. However because the power requirements fluctuate during the gait cycle; the current
battery system is not energy efficient and also since energy is dissipated through a shunt resistor when the
motor slows and changes direction. As a result the battery is (over)designed to accommodate necessary
spikes in power draw. Improvements to the power system to efficiently recover energy and provide power
spikes would enable smaller, lighter prostheses with longer use on one battery charge.
The overall objective of the Fast Track Phase I/II SBIR program is to develop energy storage device,
containing Giner’s tailored Lithium Ion Battery (LIB) and solid-state capacitor, specifically designed to harvest
energy pulses generated during braking of the joint motors in a powered prosthetic. Giner’s proposed Battery-
Capacitor Hybrid (BCH) will propel a transfemoral amputee at least 10,000 steps, on a single charge in a
powered leg prosthetic, and will extend device use during more energy intensive actions, such as running or
jumping. Extending operational range and providing rapid recharge capability will reduce range anxiety,
improve health, and raise quality of life for amputees. Generally, these advances will increase the adoption of
powered prosthetic limbs. Phase I will identify, validate key advantages, and fabricate a bench top BCH
module for a powered leg prosthetic that can regenerate energy within gait cycles and operate for ≥ 10,000
steps on a single charge. The scope of the work for the Phase II will include further refinement of the BCH
components as well as designing, building, and testing full-scale integrated BCH on prosthetics human gaits in
collaboration with well-known companies in prosthetics. Overall, our commercial goal is to build a complete
product line of BCH power systems specifically tailored to the unique needs of prosthetic products. Our
commercialization plan includes several other very relevant markets for the proposed technology that makes
development of the technology an attractive business pursuit.PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH
An estimated 2.1 million Americans presently live with a limb amputation, and the number of American
amputees is anticipated to increase nearly linearly through 2050 to 3.6 million. High functioning
prosthetics can assist in improving the quality of life and the health of these amputees. The proposed
project will develop a prosthetic customized energy storage system for motor-powered prosthetic limbs
that will improve the function, lifetime and cost of prosthetic power supplies, while improving function and
convenience (time between battery recharge) for patients.",  ,,,,BADAWI M DWEIK,,(781) 529-0520,bdweik@ginerinc.com,,  ,

treatment strategies in recent years. Previously, cancers with largely ineffective therapeutics and a poor
prognosis, such as melanoma, have experienced significant advances of patients able to extend survival
and/or progression free disease. Within the tumor microenvironment, a number of immunosuppressive
molecules are overexpressed, including CTLA-4, PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1. Simply put, inhibiting these
immunosuppressive pathways causes the reactivation of ‘exhausted’ cytotoxic and helper T cells and
subsequent attack of the tumor. However, patients treated with CPIs have experienced a variety of untoward
side effects of immune mediated adverse events (irAEs), many leading to significant morbidity and
uncertainties in balancing the management of both the autoimmunity and the cancer. These adverse events
(of grades 1-5) include colitis, pneumonitis, neuropathies, endocrinopathies, nephritis, dermatitis, and arthritis.
It is reported that upwards of 80% of CPI treated patient will experience some form of irAE. As the numbers of
patients treated with CPIs increases, coupled with the use of CPIs in combination therapies as well as the
development of new generations of CPIs, the treatment of irAEs will complicate medical care in these patients.
The simple goal of the present proposal is to develop a Luminex based bioassay of the key protein biomarkers
to which CPI patients elicit autoantibodies both prior to, and as the appearance of autoimmune syndromes
arise. A multiplexed Luminex system can detect as many as 50 biomarkers and be simply modified as new
biomarkers may emerge in the future of CPI therapy. The project is strengthened by a PI who directs a CLIA
certified diagnostic laboratory in the Department of Medicine at Yale University with close ties to the Section of
Medical Oncology and with an existing serum library collection of both patients treated with CPIs and of
patients with spontaneous autoimmune disease. Phase I studies will develop and perform early specificity
studies with the panel of biomarkers while phase II studies will be expanded to include a screening of larger
cohorts of patients on specific CPI types as well as a robust, sensitive and specific bioassay system.This project will develop a Luminex bead based bioassay system to assess the key targets of immune related
adverse events (irAEs) in cancer patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs). The scope of the 12
month project will be to acquire the protein biomarkers, development of the multiplex bead system, and
assess standardized control sera, both commercially available and analytes from the College of American
Pathology (CAP), as well as a cohort of CPI treated cancer patients.",  ,,,,MARK J MAMULA,,(203) 737-2840,mark.mamula@yale.edu,YALE UNIVERSITY,  ,

These single-purpose systems are traditionally composed of subsystems with proprietary interfaces that inherently limit module reuse and promote sole-source vendor selection over open competition. This inhibits potential technological and cost enhancements. Recent developments in enabling sensor technology such as digital beamforming, high capacity computing, and arbitrary waveform generation provide the requisite hardware foundation for a single multi-mission radar capable of providing battlefield Air Surveillance (AS), Air Defense (AD), and Counterfire Target Acquisition (CTA). Furthermore, current systems that perform multiple missions are often unable to perform those missions in parallel. Under strenuous mission loads, these radars will not have enough resources to sequentially perform all required tasks in optimal fashion. Balancing the competing time and energy needs of each mission in a single system while providing an effectiveness assessment requires a novel approach to intelligent resource management.

PROJECT SUMMARY
Hearing loss is a major health concern in our society, affecting over 360 million people
worldwide (World Health Organization, 2017). Cisplatin chemotherapy causes permanent
hearing loss in 40-60% of treated cancer patients. To date, no drugs have been approved by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for protection from cisplatin-, noise-, or age-related hearing
loss. Most candidate compounds currently in pre-clinical trials are related to antioxidants,
vitamins, and glutathione metabolism, and thus many of these compounds, such as sodium
thiosulfate, can interfere with cisplatin’s ability to kill the tumor cells.
We recently conducted unbiased high-throughput screens of bioactive compounds (total of
4,385 unique compounds) in a cochlear ear cell line and identified cyclin dependent kinase-2
(CDK2) as an important therapeutic target for cisplatin-induced cell death and hearing loss. In
the following focused screen of an additional 187 CDK2 inhibitors that have desirable drug-like
properties, we identified AZD5438 as the top hit, exhibiting an IC50 of 540 nM in the cochlear cell
line and an excellent IC50 of 5 nM ex vivo in mouse P3 cochlear explants treated with cisplatin.
AZD5438 was the most potent CDK2 inhibitor tested in our cochlear explant studies.
Furthermore, by local delivery of AZD5438 to adult FVB mice, the compound showed full
protection against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity as measured by Auditory Brainstem Response
(ABR) thresholds and cochlear histology. AZD5438 also protected against cisplatin induced hair
cell loss in vivo in zebrafish lateral line neuromasts at 100 nM.
Here we will evaluate the potential to repurpose the anti-cancer small molecule AZD5438, an
orally bioavailable CDK2 inhibitor that has already been found to be tolerated in healthy male
volunteers and solid-tumor patients in phase I and phase II clinical trials, for protection against
cisplatin-induced hearing loss. Our Specific Aim is to test whether AZD5438 protects from
cisplatin-induced hearing loss by systemic delivery in a mouse model. Our approach is to
administer AZD5438 by oral gavage to adult FVB mice treated with cisplatin, measure their ABR
thresholds and analyze their cochlear histology. The maximum non-toxic dose of oral AZD5438
will be experimentally determined and tested for hearing-protective effects. This work will shed
light on the possibility of using AZD5438 in an oral formulation to combat cisplatin-induced
hearing loss. In comparison to local delivery, oral delivery of an effective pharmaceutical product
has the advantage of patient convenience. In the future, we will also test the efficacy of oral
AZD5438 to protect from noise- and age- related hearing loss. If oral delivery of AZD5438
proves protective in this study, we will apply for IND-enabling SBIR phase II studies for cisplatin-
induced hearing loss in cancer patients.
As the main inventors for CDK2 inhibitors for hearing loss, both founders of Ting Therapeutics
LLC have already obtained the exclusive patent rights for AZD5438 and filed patent applications
in Europe, China, Japan and Hong Kong, and are negotiating for licensing the US patent rights.
Oral delivery of AZD5438, if successful, has the potential to be a significant step forward in
treating cancer patients against cisplatin-induced hearing loss.PROJECT NARRATIVE
The work in this proposal focuses on the development of an oral therapeutic small molecule
AZD5438 against cisplatin-induced hearing loss. If successful, this project will be a significant
step forward in the treatment of cisplatin-induced hearing loss in cancer patients.",  ,,,,MARISA L ZALLOCCHI,,(402) 280-4069,marisazallocchi@creighton.edu,,  ,

Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), a highly contagious non-polio enterovirus, caused the 2014 outbreak affecting
thousands of people in multiple countries, including the US, Canada and Europe. Historically, symptoms of EV-
D68 infections include rhinorrhea, muscle aches and cough. However, during the 2014 outbreak, there were
increasing cases involving more severe respiratory symptoms and hospitalization. Also, because the EV-D68
infections coincided with an increase of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) cases, EV-D68 is suspected to be associated
with AFM even though more data are needed to understand the relationship between them. EV-D68 is currently
listed as one of NIAID’s priority pathogens. Unfortunately, there are no FDA-approved drugs or vaccines for the
treatments of the EV-D68 infection. Therefore, there is an urgent medical need for more potent therapeutics
tailored for EV-D68. The overall goal of this project is to identify and develop small molecule protease inhibitors
of EV-D68 2Apro as prophylactics and/or therapeutics for EV-D68 infections and preferably also for infections of
the highly related virus EV-A71, which is responsible for hand-foot-and-mouth disease and whose 2Apro shares
a conserved sequence and catalytic triad with 2Apro of EV-D68. Our strategy is to address the unmet medical
need by identifying small molecule inhibitors targeting the enzymatic activity of a newly characterized EV-D68
protease, 2Apro. The approach is to leverage our experience with 2Apro and homogeneous biochemical screens
utilizing FRET to identify small molecules that inhibit the enzymatic activity of 2Apro. In Preliminary Studies, we
developed a FRET assay for EV-D68 2Apro and have applied the assay in a low/medium-throughput screen of
~2000 compounds with Z’-factors ≥0.7. The pilot screen identified telaprevir as an inhibitor of EV-D68 2Apro with
confirmed antiviral activity against a panel of contemporary EV-D68 strains. In Phase I, for Aim 1, an FRET HTS
will be optimized and applied to diverse chemical libraries for the identification of small molecules that inhibit the
enzymatic activity of 2Apro. In Aim 2, FRET secondary assays, a thermal shift assay and a cell-based CPE assay
will be optimized and used to validate confirmed hits, to determine the binding affinity, and to measure in vitro
antiviral activity against strains of serotypes D68 and A71. In Aim 3, validated hits prioritized based on their drug-
likeness and antiviral spectrum will be evaluated for their ADME properties. We will also explore preliminary
SAR of prioritized validated hits. In Phase II, we will chemically optimize priority inhibitors for potency and
selectivity, in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties, and evaluate them in animal infection models.Narrative
Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), an NIH NIAID priority pathogen, is a global health concern with no FDA-approved
treatment. This proposal aims to discover novel compounds that inhibit the protease activity of a newly
characterized enzyme EV-D68 2Apro, and thereby, block the infection of EV-D68. Such early acting inhibitors
could be developed into important drugs to treat enterovirus infections.",  ,,,,GAI  LIU,,(508) 757-2800,gliu@microbiotix.com,,  ,

landscape are associated with a range of human pathologies including cancer, neurological disorders, and aging.
However, current chromatin accessibility assays (e.g. ATAC-seq) lack compatibility with both fixed and native
(i.e. unfixed) samples. Moreover, it remains challenging to normalize samples for cross-study comparisons,
which significantly limits the development of epigenetics-focused drugs and undermines their future clinical
dissection (e.g. biomarker development).Here, EpiCypher is partnering with New England Biolabs (NEB) to commercialize UniNicE-seqTM
(Universal Nicking Enzyme Assisted Sequencing), a breakthrough chromatin accessibility platform. In
contrast to current technologies, UniNicE-seq is fully compatible with native and fixed sample workflows, as well
as being highly sensitive and requiring significantly less sequencing depth (andgt;10-fold vs. ATAC-seq). The
innovation of this technology is the application of DNA nicking and polymerase enzymes to incorporate
biotin-labeled nucleotides into accessible chromatin regions for subsequent DNA purification, library
sequencing, and genomic mapping. We have successfully used this approach to reliably generate high quality
chromatin accessibility maps in both fixed and native cells. Importantly, these datasets corroborate those
generated by current approaches (ATAC-seq and DNase-seq), demonstrating strong proof of concept for
UniNicE-seq. Here, our goal is to commercialize UniNicE-seq kits and assay services. EpiCypher is an
industry leader in the development of spike-in controls for epigenetics-focused genomic analyses. In Aim 1, we
will leverage this expertise to develop recombinant DNA-based spike-in controls for quantitative UniNicE-seq
assay normalization. This approach is essential to standardize assay methodology and for reliable cross-sample
comparisons. In Aim 2, we will develop and rigorously validate our fully quantitative UniNicE-seq assays in a
range of cell and tissue types, using both native and fixed sample workflows. This Aim will also include the
development of user-friendly bioinformatic tooling to perform “one-click” analyses of UniNicE-seq samples
(including sample normalization and comparisons). In Aim 3, we will develop and validate UniNicE-seq beta kits
for commercial launch and end-to-end assay services. Together, these Aims will provide key reagents, methods,
and application data as we begin to market our UniNicE-seq kits and end-to-end contract research services for
chromatin research and drug discovery.PROJECT NARRATIVEChromatin accessibility is a hallmark of active gene transcription and altered in a range of conditions,
from cancer to aging. Current chromatin accessibility assays are limited by their ability to work with both fixed
and native (i.e. unfixed) samples. Moreover, these assays lack controls for reliable cross-sample comparisons.
Here, EpiCypher is partnering with New England Biolabs (NEB) to commercialize UniNicE-seqTM (Universal
Nicking Enzyme Assisted Sequencing), a breakthrough quantitative chromatin accessibility assay platform. In
contrast to current technologies, UniNicE-seq is fully compatible with native and fixed sample workflows, highly
sensitive, and truly quantitative. This innovative and high impact technology will have broad application in the
fields of chromatin research and epigenetics-focused drug development.",  ,,,,MICHAELCHRISTOPHER  KEOGH,,(617) 899-7804,mkeogh@epicypher.com,,  ,

Our goal is to develop a new cell-based HTS platform that can be used to improve antiviral drug discovery.
Infection by Dengue virus causes ~100 million illnesses annually, with outbreak severity and frequency
increasing with time. This is true of all RNA viruses, which includes Zika, Ebola, Influenza, Yellow Fever, and
Hepatitis C, to name a few. In addition to the health burden Dengue alone represents, dengue fever constitutes
a large global financial burden (~39 billion USD), and with 20% of the world’s population living in at-risk areas
there is an urgent need for dengue therapeutics. There is currently no approved universal vaccine or dengue
specific antiviral drug. Current antiviral drugs on the market target viral enzymes; viral enzymes often have
structures that are not present in mammalian cells and are absolutely required for their life cycle making them
good targets. High throughput screening assays for dengue drug discovery are either performed in vitro or in
vivo. In vitro assays are target specific, but results do not translate well when performed in cells. In vivo assays
are more clinically relevant, but the target of the drug is unknown, making it hard to predict toxicity and tailor the
drug to improve efficacy. Despite interest in dengue antivirals, no dengue antiviral has successfully passed
clinical testing, suggesting a need for a better antiviral screening platform that can combine the advantages of
in vitro and in vivo assays. We plan to use our propriety RNA aptamer technology to develop a target-specific
cell-based HTS platform targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of dengue virus. RdRP is an
ideal target in Dengue due to its high identity across serotypes, and an ideal target in RNA viruses because of
its critical role in viral replication, and its lack of a mammalian counterpart. The goal of this application is to
develop a fluorescent sensor capable of monitoring RdRP transcription in a cell line stably expressing viral
proteins to advance dengue antiviral discovery. Phase II of this application is to develop a completely
comprehensive cell line stably expressing both viral proteins and a fluorescent sensor for use in HTS assays.
Phase II will also include the development of similar assays for other viruses, including Zika and Ebola, based
off design knowledge from this Phase I grant.Project Narrative
RNA viruses, such as dengue virus, infect hundreds of millions of people annually; dengue virus
is one of the most prolific RNA viruses, with ~20% of the world’s population in at risk areas. To
improve current efforts to find dengue antiviral agents, we propose to develop a robust cell-based
assay capable of specifically monitoring viral transcription in cellular conditions. Successful assay
development will enhance dengue drug development and design principles can be applied to
other RNA viruses.",  ,,,,CAROLYN  CARR,,(775) 848-1290,carolyn@lucernatechnologies.com,,  ,

The performance tool will compute the specific sensor performance in the noise field and compute the cumulative probability of detection for a target transiting a barrier, or patrolling within a field of sensors. The cost model will be based upon publicly available (and industry survey) sensor costs including hydrophones, vector sensors, arrays, cables, power supplied, undersea network boxes etc. Both codes will be integrated within an interactive immersive 3D environment for visualization.

The technology will focus on improving geolocation accuracy of mobile devices in rich scattering environments, where current technology suffers significant degradation. In some situations, the location accuracy in these degraded environments results in first responders unable to locate the emergency sufficiently fast, costing lives. The geolocation technology uses the large antenna arrays expected with the onset of 5G and leveraging the attendant rich scattering environments to enhance the location accuracy of current techniques. This level of geolocation accuracy will lead to many new commercial applications, such as augmented reality and autonomous vehicles. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will prove the technical feasibility of the non-line of sight geolocation technology. There are multiple aspects of this project well-grounded theoretically, but requiring demonstration as well as research in algorithms to both improve the performance of the solution and decrease the necessary processing power. The first area of research is RF phenomenology of: 1) the ability to rely on far-field models; and 2) clustered multipath models. The second research area is deconstructing a multipath channel to its individual ray components accurately enough to represent the true electromagnetic reflections, then using that derived information for geolocation. The goal of this project is to advance the technology to proof-of-concept demonstration of both the RF phenomenology and the non-line of sight geolocation algorithms. This will be accomplished through algorithm development in simulation environments and further validated with over-the-air experimentation. It is expected that RF phenomenology models will be refined in this process and fed back into the simulation environment.

The estimated commercial potential on the $325 B global forestry industry is an additional $3.4 B of unlocked value through faster, cheaper, and more accurate inventory systems. Warmer temperatures have contributed to an explosion in pest epidemics that have destroyed over 120 million acres of timberland in the US since 1998. In addition, these temperatures and dead trees have exacerbated wildland fire, with annual economic damage estimated to be $350 B. The societal impact of these problems is pervasive, as smoke plumes can drift for thousands of miles and adversely affect human health and environmental pollution. One fundamental requirement to address these problems is an automated forest monitoring system, as current systems still heavily rely on manual measurements. This project will enhance scientific and technological understanding by developing autonomous and large-scale semantic mapping robotic systems for dense, natural forests to tackle these broader high-impact problems. In addition, this project will provide high-tech career opportunities in rural communities by training skilled operators to develop, deploy, and control the robot teams in forests. This Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the first commercially viable automated timber cruise to estimate forest volume from below the canopy level. The forestry industry still relies on manual measurements because, due to fundamental technical challenges, the technology to autonomously measure tree sizes under the canopy over long distances does not exist. This project will overcome two limiting challenges: 1) Robust Autonomy Challenge: No one has achieved robust autonomy in truly 3D, unstructured, GPS-denied environments where manual control (teleoperation) is not feasible; and 2) Large-Scale Semantic Mapping Challenge: No one has attempted semantic mapping at the scale and accuracy proposed, as most demonstrations have been for a few object instantiations and without the need for precise measurement. To tackle these challenges, the project anticipates three technical results: 1) Real-time tree detection to robustly detect trees in challenging conditions; 2) Continuous-Time Semantic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping to precisely model trees over vast distances; and 3) Fast Online Motion Planning with Deep Model Predictive Control to robustly navigate unmanned aerial vehicles in cluttered forest environments.

The research project will resolve the technical risks associated with operating a high-efficiency CO2 heat pump in combined heating and hot water applications, and with implementing efficient load shifting in these applications. The project has the potential to reduce user energy costs, grid system costs, and environmental impacts by: shifting electrical load from peak demand times to off-peak demand times, reducing the need for costly and highly polluting peak power generation resources, and integrating variable renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar at times of low demand. This will put downward pressure on electric rates, as well as provide immediate user bill savings through lower demand and by shifting electricity demand to the cheapest times. The proposed system has the potential for large-scale commercial deployment due to its significantly lower operating costs and lowered initial fixed investments.

CO2 heat pumps have demonstrated high efficiency in hot water applications with coefficients of performance up to 5. However, they typically operate much less efficiently in combined systems due to a lack of advanced controls. The research will develop a thermal stratification model of a hot water tank based on customer use and charging conditions, a predictive thermal demand model, and a simulation model of the whole system integrating heat pump performance, tank stratification, and predictive customer demand.

In aviation, the capability of the Navigation Relative Positioning System (NIRPS) working with GPS as a reliable interoperable mutual backup system will significantly reduce the need for ground control, hence providing flight safety and the ability to reduce the massive cost of ground support services. In space applications, NIRPS will significantly improve guidance and control of many space operations, from Low Earth Orbit to Beyond Earth Orbit space missions. It will enhance autonomous rendezvous, improve accuracy of position sensing, and increase the capability of docking without humans in the loop. It will significantly reduce dependence on ground-based tracking, ranging, trajectory/orbit/attitude determination and maneuver planning support functions, and complexity of the flight control algorithms. By continuously holding position information on trajectory, NIRPS will provide programmable capabilities to allow the spacecraft to act independently from ground control, devising real-time actions in response to environmental conditions as well rejecting possible hijacking attempts. NIRPS will enable classes of missions which would not be previously possible. The proposed project will address the problems of aerospace navigation by providing onboard reliable real time autonomous cybersecure navigation for aerospace applications. Due to the latency and instability of inertial navigation, aerospace navigation relies on GPS, beacons, and flight/mission control systems. Contrary to inertial navigation utilizing forces of spinning mass or propagation of light inside rotational media, the proposed NIRPS utilizes collinear displacement of the inertial frame in relation to the independent propagation of light within. The Phase I project encompasses the feasibility of deploying photonics methods of fabrication of the NIRPS key component, the Non-Inertial Velocity Detector (NIVD). Silicon photonics is becoming the leading technology for Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) due to large-scale integration, low cost, and high-volume production enabled by the Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication process.

This will reduce the overall footprint of the project by reducing the milling, hauling and remixing of asphalt by at least 50%, as well as reducing traffic congestion. This will produce a better, longer lasting road at a fraction of the time and cost while delivering it in a way that is much friendlier to the environment and society. Benefits of this approach are to create higher quality roads that are safer, enable improved gas mileage, and reduce vehicle maintenance costs; and faster completion of paving projects at reduced cost.

dramatically over the past two decades. Efficient and effective resources and materials for training neonatal
care providers in empirically based practices for NOWS are greatly needed. The goal of the proposed Phase I
STTR project is to develop a highly accessible mobile/web-based multimedia curriculum for training neonatal
health care providers in best practices for assessing and treating NOWS. The project will demonstrate proof-of-
concept and feasibility of a web-based multimedia curriculum that provides a professional development
experience enabling neonatal care providers to successfully assess and administer evidence-based non-
pharmacologic family-centered care for newborns with NOWS. We will develop curriculum content including
scripted video scenarios, interactive learning components, and quizzes delivered via a mobile/web-based
platform. Focus groups with ten neonatal care providers will 33Tinform the content, structure, and style of the new
curriculum by reviewing an existing preliminary version of the curriculum. 33TUsing these focus group data, we will
create multimedia experiences featuring scripted video segments demonstrating core NOWS clinical practices
and procedures. The curriculum will be delivered on a mobile application built within a web-based infrastructure
allowing both app-based and web-based experiences. A community advisory board comprised of members
representing state public health departments and agencies, pediatric healthcare facilities, and pediatric
healthcare associations will provide feedback on the completed modules and offer guidance on further
development, dissemination, and marketing of the curriculum. We will demonstrate usability and commercial
viability of the completed curriculum modules through these interviews and through pilot testing with a sample
of neonatal care providers who will use the completed curriculum modules and complete pre-post NOWS
knowledge tests and after completing the modules complete a product usability assessment. Upon passing our
benchmarks for Phase I, we will propose a Phase II STTR project that will support full production of all modules
in the curriculum as well as an implementation trial to establish the effects of the curriculum on provider
practices and patient outcomes. Following a successful Phase II, the NOWS curriculum will be marketed to
state public health departments and agencies, pediatric healthcare facilities, managed care organizations.
Organizational investment in the curriculum could produce returns many times over by virtue of fewer days of
inpatient hospitalization for newborns with NOWS, less intensive and costly treatment regimens, and improved
health outcomes driven by reductions in medically unnecessary pharmacologic treatments and increased use
of non-pharmacologic family-centered interventions.Project Narrative
The incidence of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) in the United States has grown dramatically
over the past two decades. By 2016, the incidence of NOWS in the United States grew to an estimated 20 out
of 1000 births. Standards of care for newborns with NOWS call for extensive observation and monitoring of
such infants with the majority being admitted to neonatal intensive care units for pharmacological treatment.
Prevailing intensive care regimens for NOWS are exorbitantly expensive. This project will develop a highly
accessible mobile/web-based multimedia curriculum for training neonatal health care providers in best
practices for assessing and treating newborns with opioid withdrawal syndrome. The curriculum will be tailored
to address the needs of healthcare providers and patient populations in rural communities where facilities and
resources for providing comprehensive care for infants with opioid exposure and their mothers are limited.",  ,,,,DAVID R SMITH,,(541) 484-2123,david.smith@or-bis.com,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,  ,

Invasive species disproportionately affect vulnerable communities in poor rural areas, especially in developing countries, who depend on natural resources, healthy ecosystems, trade and tourism for their livelihoods. Moreover, invasive insect pests can drive food insecurity and undermine ongoing investments in development. There is a growing consensus that ""Early detection and rapid response"" is the best solution, but the ""Early detection"" part of this equation has been lagging for want of robust automatic surveillance systems. The proposed project will investigate how to generalize existing machine learning models for insect classification under more general conditions. In particular, existing machine learning models typically make strong assumptions about the ""priors"" (the prior probably of seeing a given insect) due to the use of very specific attractants. However, to reduce the cost of deployment of insect surveillance, we will investigate the design of pheromone ""cocktails"" (combination of two or more pheromones) to attract multiple insect species to a single trap. This will require creating new models that do not make such strong assumptions about the insects to be encountered. In addition, the project will investigate novel design principles to create ""compromise"" traps. For example, if insect A is attracted to the blue color, and insect B is attracted to the red color, is the best color attractant a mixture of the colors (green), or a patchwork work of two colors be arranged as panels, tiles, stripes, etc.? Beyond color, we proposed to investigate the optimal compromises for texture, shape, trap placement, trap orientation etc. Thus, our proposed innovation will lie in producing sensors/physical traps that can simultaneously monitor multiple invasive pests.

behavioral delays affecting over 3.5 million Americans. These delays vary with the severity of symptoms that present in
ASD but often result in limited speech and increased communication challenges. Alongside linguistic acquisition, oral motor
coordination is a crucial part of speech production. Current clinical techniques have shown varying degrees of efficacy in
improving functional language proficiency. Most techniques follow a drill-like procedure, where the child is made to repeat
various sounds and phrases until they are retained. However, such a process requires potentially over twenty therapy sessions
to show improvement which may then only be focused on one aspect of speech. This significantly limits the linguistic and
social skills a student will acquire. To improve the efficacy of these therapy sessions, new technology must be developed
to provide the most effective educational experience. Video-assisted speech technology (VAST) is a method of using a
video of a close-up model of the mouth and speaking simultaneously with it. Rather than present the individual with a static
photograph of the initial phoneme, the entire sequence of oral movements can be presented sequentially via video-recorded
segments of the orofacial area producing connected speech, combining best practices, video modeling, and literacy with
auditory cues to provide unprecedented support the development of vocabulary, word combinations and communication.
In this SBIR Phase I proposal, iTherapy will develop a personalized educational experience for students with ASD
by creating a virtual reality (VR) based VAST program to stimulate engagement and speech production practice.
VR offers several benefits as a therapy technique: overcoming sensory difficulties, more effectively generalizing
information, employing visual learning, and providing individualized treatment. As a user moves through the stages of the
program, they will be immersed in a proactive environment where they will engross themselves with continuous content.

will require the use of an app on a tablet or a smartphone, VR goggles, and bone conduction headphones. The incorporation
of the VAST system into special education classrooms will help children with ASD to enhance their functional and social
communicative abilities. The VR system will teach them various motor and word production skills which will grow their
vocabulary, reading skills, understanding of speech, and functional language usage as a whole. By building upon standard

The sensor is based on a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensing technique applicable for high-speed measurements, incorporating multiple transducers to enable spatially resolved pressure detection. The innovative detection technology relies on time-domain spectral measurements that enable high spectral resolution and time multiplexing of multiple sensing points. The design uses a unique mechanical transducer that coverts pressure to strain with a large magnification ratio for and detection sensitivity and high dynamic range. During Phase I, PSI will develop theoretical models to simulate water turbulence conditions and measurement characteristics of the envisioned FBG pressure sensor. A prototype with one sensing element will be developed and tested to demonstrate feasibility. The successful feasibility experiment will lay the foundation for the Phase I Option development and testing of an expanded sensor system, including 10 spatially-distributed sensing elements.

Additionally, compared to RF systems, FSO systems have very low Size, Weight and Power (SWaP). These advantages are often viewed to be hampered by the challenges of operating through the atmosphere, which creates scintillation and absorption that can disrupt the communication link. To address these issues, SA Photonics has developed innovative techniques that provide robust and reliable communication through a wide variety of atmospheric conditions, while maintaining a simple and low-cost system architecture. There are currently no FSO systems in use today on airborne platforms, mainly due to the need to use large and expensive stabilized gimbals. SA Photonicsâ€™ AgileBeam FSO system includes internal optical beam stabilization that allows the terminal to be directly attached to the aircraft, greatly reducing the cost to deploy and allowing use even on small UAVs.

Additionally, FSO systems operate without RF emissions and are inherently immune to RF interference and jamming. The narrow optical beams and small Field-of-View of the optical receivers also make FSO systems LPI/LPD and difficult to disrupt by intentional jamming. Space-based FSO systems have been demonstrated, and are being considered for many upcoming commercial and military satellite systems. However, widespread adoption of space-based FSO systems has not occurred, partly due to the custom nature of most FSO systems. For each space-based application, a custom FSO system is typically developed. What is needed is a reconfigurable FSO terminal that can be used for a wide variety of missions, including operation in LEO, MEO and GEO orbits, and supporting both crosslink and up/down-link operation.

In the hypersonic environment, the electron thermal speed is larger than the ion thermal speed by several orders of magnitude and thus the flux of electrons to the microparticle surfaces far exceeds that of ions. In this way, the free electron number density in the plasma is reduced due to the microparticles collecting a net negative charge. Using this mechanism, the microparticle-modified dielectric structure of the plasma can be modeled and coupled into the IERUS proprietary antenna design optimization software suite, V-Lox, which will be used to analyze the propagation of RF antenna signals through representative radome materials and the plasma layer.

Human watchstanders use a variety of cues and heuristics to scan the surroundings and contacts optimally, but current camera systems do not offer the same intelligent, adaptive perception. To deliver capable, adaptable maritime perception, we propose to design and demonstrate the feasibility of Adaptive Perception Behaviors (APB) for smart maritime cameras. APB enables cameras to behave like human watchstanders, without intervention from external autonomy systems, by intelligently balancing competing perception behaviors, such as examining contacts and scanning the surface for new contacts. APB couples our SeaSaw smart maritime camera with a pan-tilt mount and intelligent behavior optimization to create a self-controlled camera that can detect, classify, and track ships and decide on the best order in which to inspect surface contacts to ensure safe navigation.

Degraded or faulty sensors can prevent the USV/UUV from navigating around the environment, detecting hazards, and monitoring the health/status of on-ship components. In this proposal, Spatial Integrated Systems, Inc (SIS), through its real world and laboratory experience in robotics, autonomy, and Unmanned Vehicles (UxV) proposes to solve this problem by analyzing, predicting, and triangulating in-stride sensor readings. The goal is to provide the capability to detect a faulty or degraded sensor, based on newly developed sensor degradation algorithms/ combinations of algorithms, then to select the best reaction behavior to mitigate the risk caused by the degraded or faulty sensor. Combining this system for managing reactions with the sensors used by the autonomy systems will result in a reduction of manual interventions during UxV operations.

The Perception LEC will be pre-trained to detect a target object in a side-scan sonar image, and outputs the property of the detected object.

This allows for global behavior models to be adapted to local regions by replacing the intention/destination functions with those more appropriate for the region, allowing for a powerful-yet-flexible model that adapts to regionally specific problems.

Since developers need to produce less code to generate working software, systems can be developed more quickly, maintained more easily, and are less expensive.

Historically, pattern recognition and anomaly detection were dependent on statistical analysis. Patterns were defined as statistical models and anomalies were defined as outliers. Advancements in machine learning have allowed for identification of more complex patterns and adaptive anomaly detection. A method of machine learning known as online learning updates a neural net model in real time by continuously incorporating new data. This is essential for spatiotemporal data, which has confounding variables that alter patterns over time. Since flight routing is constantly changing due to temporal variables such as weather, identifying air corridors and detecting anomalous aircraft behavior requires an online approach that takes into account such variables. It is also feasible to develop a small, inexpensive, ADS-B anomaly detector that operates independently or in a network, on stationary and mobile platforms.

We propose a two-stage end-to-end framework, in which the first stage selects the most significant frames while the second stage recognizes the event using the selected frames. Our model needs only event-level labels in the training stage, and thus is more practical when the sub-activity labels are missing or difficult to obtain. The results of extensive experiments show that our model can achieve significant improvement in event recognition from long videos while maintaining high accuracy even if the test videos suffer from severe rhythm changes.

Although missions proceed in the context of the global plan using the environmental forecast, local wind, current and sea state conditions are monitored using tracking filters and a Parametric Bayesian Estimator that attempts to estimate where parameters of the current environmental conditions are in relation to the forecast and adjusts the forecast as necessary. The environmental parameters estimated with the Bayesian Estimator are kept in several simple classes (e.g. “high sea states delayed 3 hours”) since more sophisticated weather forecasting is not possible onboard the USV in real-time.

However, flexible configuration in modern manufacturing system can shift production from one product to another quickly. Therefore, manually designed features in traditional machine learning technique may lead to insufficient or unsatisfactory inspection performance in complex surface scenarios or dynamic changing process. Addressing these challenges Analatom proposes using deep learning to learn high-level generic features that apply to wide range of textures or difficult-to-detect defects cases. Transfer-learning can extract the knowledge from one source task and then applies the learned knowledge to different but related task. It employs pre-trained deep learning model from relevant task for model initialization and fine-tuning enabling knowledge reuse and updating as transferred deep learning. This allows building inspection systems for novel manufacturing inspection tasks and transitioning to inspect new asset types rapidly and with little skilled oversight from user.",Robert  Brown,,(478) 222-3508,robert.brown4@robins.af.mil,Neil  Eklund,Chief Data Scientist,(408) 980-9516,neil.eklund@analatom.com,,  ,

It does not detect fog, clouds, clear air turbulence or wind shear, sand storms, or lightning. Weather radar displays depend on signal returns, and heavy precipitation may conceal weather behind an intervening cell due to signal attenuation.

To better understand particle ingestion, and to plan maintenance, the Navy is interested in developing sensors that can measure particle loading in real time onboard operational gas turbine engines. Ingested particles may include sand, dust, salt spray, sulfates, or even volcanic ash. Particles with high melting temperature, such as quartz, may fully transit the engine when ingested.

The FSC module, which has already been demonstrated in a laboratory environment at TTNT frequencies, automatically and selectivity cancels high-power interferers while minimally impacting lower-power signals of interest. The FSC module is capable of selectively rejecting a threat by >50 dB, whether it is in-band/near-band, modulated, or CW, without the need for a sense antenna or any complicated digital signal processing.

impairments. Intensive rehabilitation could reduce their impairments, but access to such therapy is
limited. Home therapy could supplement time with a therapist, but the current standard of care is
simply providing individuals printed sheets of exercises, an approach that is not motivating and
often not effective. Technological solutions do exist, but none provide an effective means for
individuals to directly practice activities of daily living in a motivating way on their own at home. The
goal of this Fast Track SBIR is to develop and test FitMi Plus, an improved version of Flint Rehab’s
commercially successful FitMi system for motivating at-home therapeutic exercise. The original
FitMi system consists of two wireless input devices called Pucks that each contain an array of
sensors and connect to a software application that detects when simple exercises are completed.
FitMi Plus will expand the capabilities of FitMi to detect the completion of activities of daily living by
coupling common objects to the Pucks via distinct Functional Modules. This approach has the key
advantage of allowing the most expensive and complex components of the system to be reused
with each Functional Module, thus minimizing cost and maximizing system flexibility. We
hypothesize that home therapy with FitMi Plus will be feasible for individuals with motor impairment
due to stroke and more motivating and effective than the current standard of practice, printed
sheets of exercises. The aims of this Fast Track project are to: 1) Establish the feasibility of FitMi
Plus by pilot testing an initial set of 4 Functional Modules that can detect turning a doorknob,
zipping a zipper, turning on a light switch, and pouring liquid into a glass; 2) Expand the library of
Functional Modules based on feedback from PTs and OTs; and 3) Compare the efficacy of home-
based functional training with FitMi Plus to non-functional exercise in a randomized controlled trial
with individuals with chronic stroke. We hypothesize that individuals who exercise with FitMi Plus
will have significantly greater increases in functional ability than individuals who do not perform
functional exercises during their home therapy. If successful, this project will result in a
commercially-ready, clinically validated home therapy tool that could become widely adopted in
actual practice, thus improving long-term functional recovery after stroke.This research is relevant to public health because it will increase the accessibility, lower the costs, and
improve the outcomes of rehabilitation therapy. This will provide a pathway to a better life for millions of
U.S citizens suffering from motor impairment after stroke and other neurologic injuries. Not only does
rehabilitation therapy reduce the likelihood of devastating complications, it also improves functional
ability, increasing the standard of living of individuals with impairment and reducing the burden on society

A major challenge facing pipeline operators is that many pipelines are old, making their structural integrity uncertain, and that material pedigree of the pipeline steel is unknown. Therefore, operations must be based on minimum values of the material parameters. The probability that actual fracture toughness is higher than the minimum is reasonably high, which means that pipelines are operating below capacity. Nondestructive determination of fracture toughness by ball indentation has not sufficiently solved the problem. Nonlinear features of ultrasonic wave propagation are sensitive to material nonlinearities associated with microstructure (based on composition and processing) that dictate fracture toughness. Nonlinear ultrasound-based technology to nondestructively determine fracture toughness of pipeline steels was demonstrated in Phase I.

A laminate comprised of stacked prepreg plies are cured under a vacuum in addition to ~7 bar of pressure to prevent formation of voids, particularly in interlaminar (inter-sheet/ply) regions. However, manufacturing composites within an autoclave is accompanied by high acquisition and operation costs due to the necessity of specialized heated pressure vessels. Furthermore, these costs increase dramatically as the size of structure increases. The capacity of autoclaves limits the size of parts, and the production rate is primarily affected by autoclave availability. As a result, there has been interest in development of alternative techniques.

According to the World Health Organization, 4 million deaths per year globally are directly linked to ambient air pollution. Until now, the approach to monitoring of air pollutants has been limited to measurements at a few fixed-base stations spread throughout each U.S. state (e.g., ~30 in Colorado for a population of 6 million), and those stations are purposely located far from air pollution hot spots in order to obtain approximate averages. Recent advances in low-cost sensor technology has enabled new high-resolution mapping of air pollutants throughout cities and rural areas through vehicles of opportunity, such as those associated with ride share services and delivery vehicles, carrying small air quality sensor packages continuously uploading air pollution measurements to the web. The principal roadblock to this approach, addressed in this project, is a method to continuously verify the calibration of these mobile air quality sensors, inherently less accurate than traditional instruments. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop, test and evaluate a distributed calibration station, AQSync, to be mounted on lamp and traffic light posts throughout cities and towns to provide frequent distributed calibrations of vehicle-borne air quality sensor packages. A major challenge has been the development of relatively low-cost miniaturized instruments offering highly accurate measurements for inclusion in AQSync. This is particularly true for black carbon, believed to contribute substantially to up to 200,000 premature deaths each year in the U.S. through pollution-related health conditions such as asthma, stroke, heart disease and cancer. The development and commercialization of a Black Carbon Photometer in Phase I of this project represents a potentially disruptive technology facilitating measurements of black carbon directly in the gas phase, without the known artifacts associated with previous instruments and within a small footprint suitable for AQSync. This project addresses the next challenge of developing algorithms and demonstrating that implementation of distributed AQSync calibration stations enable accurate mobile sensor measurements to inform policy-makers, subsequently improving human health.

One such application of the polymer TPS is in protection of missile launch systems from extremely hot exhaust gases. Missile launch systems integrated with a ship structures, such as the Mk 41 vertical launch system (VLS), need the rocket exhaust to be diverted vertically upwards through the plenum and the uptake. These sections are lined with ablative polymers of varying thicknesses to protect the structure from intense heat from rocket exhaust. The erosion of the ablative panels determines the life of the module structure. Currently, life prediction of these ablative materials are based on pre-determined in lab tests.

DengVaxia, a recombinant live-attenuated tetravalent vaccine, is licensed and available in 20 countries. However, Phase 3 clinical trials indicated an increased risk of dengue complications if the vaccine was administered to those that had no prior dengue infection.

One way the Army mitigates this is by providing synthetic symbology and imagery. Although symbology requires one shade of gray above background, imagery requires one v2 increase in luminance for every shade of grey. Often, there is not enough luminance that the display can emit in high ambient environments for the pilot (or Soldier) to see the gray shade detail of the imagery. In addition, high ambient light can dramatically reduce the ability to differentiate color, which is detrimental when symbology is color-coded. To mitigate this issue, SA Photonics has developed an electrically controllable variable attenuator system. This system can also be used in a mode that eliminates light from propagating downrange at night, a problem with current augmented reality systems.

The size, weight, power, and bandwidth cost of rendering VR/AR content hinders the application and usage of HMDs. The introduction of foveated rendering with an eye/gaze tracking system will generate high-resolution content in the viewer’s direct line of sight and low-resolution content in the periphery where the human visual system is less susceptible to detail. However, foveated rendering is still computationally expensive as it requires multiple rendering passes of the scene with varying levels of resolution. This stems from the fact that modern GPUs are architected to render a single view per update of a display.

Nanohybrids have recently emerged as a unique scheme for quantum photodetectors with distinctive advantages over their conventional semiconductor counterparts on: 1) the strong quantum confinement in quantum dots, enabling superior light absorption, spectra tunability, and reduced dark current due to suppressed phonon scattering; 2) exciton dissociation and charge transfer at the quantum dots/graphene interface build-in field for efficient photo-carrier generation; and 3) high photoconductive gain and external quantum efficiency proportional to the ratio between the carrier lifetime enhanced by the quantum confinement and the extremely short charge transit time due to the high mobility of graphene.

For example, there are many factors that limit data availability such as militarily significant target types and Army has clear interest in the infrared (IR) domain where the deficiency of data is apparent. We propose a new approach to target recognition using transfer learning from visible image/video domain to IR domain for Army’s applications. First, we train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) using visible images from scratch, or some pre-trained CNNs such as AlexNet, ResNet, etc. can be custom trained using some specific visible data for a particular military application. Second, we propose to apply cycle consistent generative adversarial network (GAN) for unpaired image-to-image translation. That is, we will convert visible images to IR images via GAN. Third, we will also apply a game engine known as ARMA3 to synthesize realistic IR images. Fourth, the synthesized IR images from the above two steps will be further improved based on attention aware GAN (ATA-GAN). The improved infrared images will be used to fine-tune the CNN model for target classification.

Peridynamics is an extension of continuum mechanics that calculates damage and cracking in response to external forces. It will be adapted for the problem of sand particles impacting SiC/SiC CMCs. The damage footprints of the impact craters will be determined and analyzed over a range of inputs such as impact velocity and angle, particle mass, and CMC architecture.

It works by transmitting a serial symbol sequence in parallel over many orthogonal subcarriers, which enables longer symbol duration and simpler channel equalization. However, OFDM suffers from a high peak to average power ratio, which typically leads to clipping and an elevated bit error ratio (BER) when processed with linear detectors, as well as multi-path fading due to scatterers and the motion of the transmitter and receiver. When the BER becomes too high for forward error correction to compensate, the signal connection must be reestablished and previously transmitted data is lost, greatly curtailing the overall data throughput. It is therefore desirable to develop a nonlinear algorithm to correct for the effects of clipping and fading so the BER remains acceptable and renegotiation of the link is not required, thus improving overall data throughput.

An ideal underwater communications link should be compact and robust, capable of high bandwidths with low error-rates and crosstalk to establish a secure link over long distances. An optical communication system operating at visible wavelengths (having minimal water absorption) is an attractive solution as radio-frequencies are unable to deeply penetrate water and acoustic systems are low-bandwidth. The large bandwidths and high directionality of laser-based systems are a promising alternative, however, Gaussian beam systems suffer from scattering due to turbidity, aberrations from turbulence, and other obstructions (e.g. bubbles). OAM modes have been shown to be more resilient to turbidity and turbulence than Gaussian beams, are also more secure, and can be spatially multiplexed for increased bandwidth.

The proposed solutions range from low-cost/low-tech option to versatile and effective thermal management architecture to increase the adaptability and rapid technology transition. The proposed integrated solution is passive and requires no moving parts, additional components, or other support materials.

A decision aid is needed to avoid information overload and enable watchstanders to focus resources on the highest priority potential threats. To address these challenges, we propose to design the Adjustable Decision Aid for Prioritizing Threats (ADAPT) tool. ADAPT uses probabilistic models to combine expert knowledge, real-time observations, and user-configurable objectives to prioritize potential threats in multi-threat environments. ADAPT will encode expert knowledge in an extendable probabilistic modeling framework that uses real-time data from existing Undersea Warfare Decision Support System (USW-DSS) databases to assess the threat level of observed contacts. Relative threat severity is calculated across all contacts for individual watchstanders by encoding prioritization schemas dependent on their role into multi-criteria analysis algorithms.

Recent findings have shown that image-based change detection is able to identify many relevant track conditions while maintaining a detection probability near 100 percent in uncontrolled rail environments. The use of change detection transforms the rail sector machine vision problem into a relevant/non-relevant determination. Findings indicate that this reformulated problem is expected to be handled robustly and cost-effectively by machine learning.

Augmentor screech can limit the performance of military aircraft and can cause durability issues or even catastrophic failure if it occurs. Modern augmentors have close-coupled fueling using simple round injectors to minimize manufacturing cost. In a â€œjet-in-crossflowâ€Â injector, liquid fuel issues from an orifice and the penetration of the fuel jet depends on the flow rate of fuel. Screech combustion instabilities are dependent on this static flame stability and thus dependent on the penetration and atomization of the fuel jet. The prevalence of screech in the lower corner of the flight envelope is directly related to over-penetration of the fuel jets at the high fuel flow rate. Screech instabilities can be largely mitigated if a fuel injector is developed that produces a robust, largely invariant fuel distribution with good fueling of the flameholder wake. We propose to develop novel fuel injectors that are insensitive to fuel flow rate and thus engine operating condition. These injectors will more homogeneously fuel the augmentor over the flight envelope, leading to more robust combustion stability and reduced susceptibility to screech, mitigating screech before instability can initiate and grow.",Vince  Belovich,,(937) 255-4229,vincent.belovich@us.af.mil,Darin A  Knaus,Principal Investigator,(603) 643-3800,dak@creare.com,,  ,

It is based on a new system design that utilizes POC-developed, mature components from four different DoD-sponsored radar development programs. COBOSA operates in landing and sense-and-avoid modes, and it provides a full 360-degree coverage with no moving parts. It not only prevents obstacle tail-strikes but also provides situational awareness to the pilot during navigation in normal or degraded visual environments when camera systems fail. It detects passive objects such as trees, wires, and buildings and can also detect both passive obstacles and noncooperative threats such as intruder aircraft. COBOSA uses military-acceptable interfaces, such as MIL-STD-1553 or Ethernet, and for unmanned aircraft, it can integrate with the collision avoidance software for automated maneuvering. Thus, COBOSA safeguards forward missions and provides early warning of imminent obstacles, resulting in improved mission effectiveness and reduced operator workload, and preventing loss of unmanned aerial systems (UASs). In Phase I, POC will design COBOSA and develop limited-scale benchtop hardware to show component feasibility. In Phase II, POC will develop a field-ready, TRL-5/-6, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted COBOSA with collision avoidance capability that can be demonstrated to the Navy for further transition.",John N Propst,Engineer,(301) 342-3752,john.m.propst@navy.mil,Ninad  Patnekar,"Director, Innovative Technologies",(310) 320-3088,atproposals@poc.com,,  ,

A key component in an HEL AO system is the deformable mirror (DM). However, mechanical constraints in currently available DMs limits AO system performance in stressing engagements. Guidestar teamed with UCLA to develop methods that can provide AO performance with a constrained DM that is comparable to performance with an ideal DM that does not have these physical constraints. Guidestar developed a conjugate gradient method that determined an optimal DM command without violating hardware limitations in a woofer-tweeter control architecture. This method tied together within an adaptive Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework developed by UCLA. In this proposed Phase II program, Guidestar and UCLA will advance the development of these approaches, creating a complete control architecture to provide optimal AO correction using a DM that is constrained by total stroke saturation and inter-actuator stroke limits.

A key component in an HEL AO system is the deformable mirror (DM). However, mechanical constraints in currently available DMs limits AO system performance in stressing engagements. Guidestar teamed with UCLA to develop methods that can provide AO performance with a constrained DM that is comparable to performance with an ideal DM that does not have these physical constraints. Guidestar developed a conjugate gradient method that determined an optimal DM command without violating hardware limitations in a woofer-tweeter control architecture. This method tied together within an adaptive Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework developed by UCLA. In this proposed Phase II program, Guidestar and UCLA will advance the development of these approaches, creating a complete control architecture to provide optimal AO correction using a DM that is constrained by total stroke saturation and inter-actuator stroke limits.

Luna is developing a multi-input approach to address this need by combining the advantages of mechanochromic dyes/polymers with embedded fiber optic sensors. Mechanochromic dyes will irreversibly record the high-watermark of strain experienced by a webbing under high levels of elongation. Secondary dyes will quantify ultraviolet light exposure and degradation. Distributed fiber optic sensors provide high-resolution, highly-sensitive measurements that detect and localize damage without affecting the integrity of the strap. Combining these technologies enables accurate assessment of the load capabilities for nylon, polyester, and Kevlar structures during their service life. During Phase I Luna will team with New York University to demonstrate the feasibility of this innovative combination of sensing technologies. During Phase II the team will apply the sensing technology to full-scale webbings and evaluate its ability to detect strength loss due to UV exposure, heat/humidity, impact cycling, fluid contaminants, salt fog, blowing sand, and stack gas exposure.

Due to its extensive use in Military applications, the strength of the webbing is a key component of equipment design, especially in the case of safety gear that protects soldiers, as lives may be dependent on the strength and proper performance of the webbing. However, webbing inspection methods are mainly limited to visual inspection. This severely limits the assessment of webbing strength that can be made, since webbing is degraded by many unseen factors such as abrasion and exposure to UV radiation. Mechanical testing is costly and requires equipment to be taken out of use, resulting in an undesirable trade-off between costly, destructive testing, premature replacement of the webbing, and or unnecessarily putting personnel in danger. To help with webbing inspection, in this project, TDA will develop a portable, non-destructive analysis device for the inspecting of webbing and determination of its mechanical properties.

These operators and pilots are trained to assess and manage complex, four-dimensional spaces through procedures and protocols that are designed to maintain safe distances between manned aircraft. However, as airspaces are becoming more populated with increasingly autonomous unmanned aerial systems (UAS), questions arise as to what modifications should, and need, to happen in airspace management to handle these changes. Aircraft carriers/carrier groups and associated airspace present additional challenges to tactical collision avoidance (TCA) and airspace management due to combat and mission specific constraints placed on the air fleet. Particularly, missions like a Tanker Hawk operation require precision maneuvers to maintain safe flight. The Strategic and Tactical Avoidance for Congested Airspace through Learning and Mapping (STACALM) framework is set to investigate this complex problem by researching three features of safe airspace management: airspace mapping, strategic aircraft routing, and TCA.

The proposed SBIR Phase II program seeks to select a first-in-class, peripherally-restricted, and long-acting
somatostatin receptor 4 (LA-SSTR4) agonist clinical candidate for development as a novel non-addictive
analgesic able to replace opioids for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic pain. The program is based
on strong scientific evidence showing that activation of peripheral SSTR4 produces broad spectrum analgesic
activity and pursues a unique therapeutic strategy. LA-SSTR4 agonists are semi-synthetic biologics created
using a proprietary peptide-antibody conjugate (PAC) technology and having the following modular structure:
[(peptide)-(spacer)-(linker)]2-[antibody carrier]. The peptide module confers agonist activity at peripheral SSTR4,
whereas the antibody carrier provides extended duration of action and peripheral selectivity. These unique
features will allow us to achieve a markedly differentiated and superior product profile in terms of efficacy, safety,
and convenience compared to short-acting and brain-penetrating small molecule SSTR4 agonists. The extended
half-life will enable once-weekly to once-monthly subcutaneous dosing, thereby maximizing convenience,
compliance, and efficacy. The lack of penetration in the central nervous system (CNS) will prevent unnecessary
and undesired interaction with abundantly expressed SSTR4 in the CNS, eliminating any risk of CNS-mediated
SSTR4 adverse effects, thereby maximizing safety. Unlike opioids, SSTR4 agonists do not induce constipation,
respiratory depression, dependence, addiction, or abuse. Finally, unlike SSTR2 and SSTR5, SSTR4 expression
in the pituitary and pancreas is very low, supporting that selective SSTR4 agonists are unlikely to perturb
peripheral endocrine functions. The preceding SBIR Phase I program has already established the feasibility of
conjugating a short-acting, potent, and selective peptide SSTR4 agonist to the antibody carrier. The resulting
LA-SSTR4 agonist lead series has high agonist potency and selectivity for SSTR4 and has demonstrated
antinociceptive activity in an animal pain model. The proposed SBIR Phase II program seeks to: Aim 1: optimize
the existing lead series and select a clinical candidate for development, Aim 2: validate and prioritize the
indication(s) for clinical development using disease-relevant mouse pain models, and Aim 3: characterize the
pharmacokinetics and safety/toxicology profile of the clinical candidate in rat and non-human primates to help
design subsequent investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies. Assuming success with the current
proposal, the follow up Phase IIb program will establish good manufacturing practices (GMP) production for the
clinical candidate and complete the good laboratory practices (GLP) safety/toxicology studies required for the
IND application. IMPACT andamp; PROJECT NARRATIVE
This program seeks to develop a novel, safe, and convenient analgesic that will benefit both patients and society
by improving quality of life through effective, non-addictive, and better tolerated pain control while providing

The goal of this project is to complete the preclinical development of Elex Biotech’s novel compounds that target
and treat the underlying molecular cause of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT)
CPVT. There are no FDA-approved treatments for CPVT, a rare genetic disorder affecting 1/10,000 individuals,
with typical onset in children 7-9 years of age and no reported differences by gender. CPVT results in potentially
deadly arrhythmias and is responsible for 15% of sudden cardiac deaths in apparently healthy young people.
Only 5-10% of pediatric patients survive out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, often with severe neurological sequelae.
The overall mortality rate is 30-50% by age 20-30. Approximately 60% of CPVT cases are known to be caused
by mutations in type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2), the calcium release channel that regulates the strength and
frequency of heart muscle contraction. However, current medications (mainly -blockers) do not target RyR2,
and are used off-label in spite of limited efficacy and significant side-effects. Approximately 30% - 50% of patients
treated with -blockers eventually require an Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to prevent cardiac arrest.
ICDs are expensive to implant and maintain, do not prevent arrhythmias and can produce inappropriate shocks
which actually induce arrhythmias. In Europe, flecainide is used along with -blockers, but it may cause or
exacerbate existing heart rhythm problems and has a Block Box Warning in the US. Delivering a safe, effective
and targeted CPVT treatment is the goal of this program.
To advance its targeted novel therapeutic IND-enabling (GLP) studies, the Company will evaluate the lead
compound it has selected in a non-rodent species for the purpose of establishing in vivo dosing parameters. Elex
Biotech will also work with a contract manufacturing organization (CMO) to scale up the synthesis of the lead
compound under practice GMP conditions to have a large quantity of material (GMP Demo batch) suitable for
GLP studies. The Company will apply for Orphan Designation for its lead candidate and develop clinical and
regulatory strategies for later discussion in a pre-IND meeting with FDA. At the end of this project, Elex Biotech
will have both a Demo Batch of lead compound and data for determining initial in vivo dosing for initiating GLP
IND-enabling studies for the on-going Phase IIB project. In order to accomplish these goals, the following specific
aims are proposed:
Specific Aim 1. Lead compound pharmacology/toxicology studies in dogs.
Specific Aim 2. Synthesized practice GMP method development (GMP Demo) batch of lead compound with
draft master batch records.PROJECT NARRATIVE
This project is relevant to NIHandapos;s mission because it addresses the need for improved treatment
options for catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), an orphan disease
with a typical onset in children 7-9 years of age resulting in potentially deadly arrhythmias and is
responsible for 15% of unexplained sudden cardiac deaths in apparently healthy children. There
are no FDA approved treatments for CPVT; current off-label medications offer limited efficacy and
significant side effects the negatively impact quality of life. The goal of this project is to prepare a
candidate drug for clinical development as a safe and highly effective oral drug for the treatment
of CPVT.",  ,,,,DOUGLAS J KAWAHARA,,(503) 488-5870,kawahara@elexbiotech.com,,  ,

Feasibility and validation of an integrated newborn screening algorithm with targeted Next GenerationSequencing (tNGS) technology as part of a 2nd-tier test for Pompe and MPS I
Newborn screening (NBS) utilizes high throughput primary (1st-tier) screening assays paired with referral and
clinical follow-up testing to identify babies who are affected with certain inherited disorders. Where necessary,
2nd-tier tests are performed prior to referral for follow-up testing in order to reduce the number of false positives
(screen positive samples that are determined to be unaffected). False-positive newborn screens have undesired
consequences for both families and the public health lab referral system, including: high cost associated with
additional confirmatory testing, extra testing burden on referral centers, parental anxiety, parent-baby bonding
issues, and added stress to the baby with additional tests and blood draws. There exists a strong need to reduce
the rate of false positive newborn screens by implementing 2nd-tier molecular or biochemical tests prior to referral.
This Phase II project will be a continuation of our successful Phase I research, which generated an integrated
2nd-tier targeted next generation sequencing (tNGS) workflow capable of identifying both point mutations and
large deletions/duplication events from dried blood spot (DBS) specimens. We will continue to focus on Pompe
disease and Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I) -- two lysosomal storage disorders that were recently
recommended for universal NBS in the U.S., but have been challenging to implement as NBS tests due to the
high rates of pseudodeficient variants. Currently, 2nd-tier testing via either additional biochemical analysis or gene
sequencing for known pathogenic variants are used to identify pseudodeficiency and reduce false positive test
rates. We will expand our novel tNGS 2nd-tier workflow by: 1) developing bioinformatic tools for variants of
uncertain significance (VUS) cut-off and cross-reactive immunological material (CRIM) status prediction; 2)
improving our existing copy number variability (CNV) caller; and 3) integrating additional enzyme measurements
and demographic data with the tNGS score. Demographic data has previously been shown to correlate to
measured enzyme activities due to biological factors and DBS sample variability. Our algorithm will provide a
better disease state call and associated data for improved follow-up care, provide critical predictions for disease
onset and treatment considerations.
The 2nd-tier tests developed through this work will be sold initially as a diagnostic send-out service and eventually
as kits to public health labs that are currently screening, or planning to screen for Pompe disease and MPS I.
Affected individuals who are identified using our tests will be referred to follow-up earlier and will have an
accelerated path to disease confirmation and treatment. These features are especially important for Pompe
disease, where a delay in therapeutic intervention of just days is known to negatively impact long term health
outcomes. The approaches developed through this work have the potential to be expanded to cover dozens of
enzyme deficiencies from the same primary dried blood spot sample.PROJECT NARRATIVE

body. The method for diagnosing and treating NMSCs requires a skin biopsy that is processed
and stained for analysis on a standard optical microscope. This process is painful for patients,
and the invasiveness of biopsy introduces a delay into NMSC detection, which contributes to
patient morbidity and adds substantial cost to the healthcare system. Zebra Medical
Technologies (ZMT) aims to address the unmet clinical need for a better method to detect
NMSCs earlier. In Phase I of this grant, ZMT demonstrated the feasibility of a portable, skin-

with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) the ability to detect pathologic features of BCC (Aim 3). ZMT
has created the first fiber coupled multiphoton microscopy (MPM) system for in vivo imaging of
skin cellular anatomy. Building on this success, ZMT will build clinical evidence in Phase II to
support a 510(k) submission for United States Food andamp; Drug Administration (FDA) clearance.
This is a necessary and valuable step towards bringing this technology into regular clinical
practice. In this proposal we will accomplish three aims: Aim 1) Advance development of the

The project addresses significant challenges faced by DHH individuals in using mainstream videoconferencing platforms. The spotlighting feature in videoconferencing platforms is a critical tool for enhancing DHH communication accessibility. It enhances visibility and focus by prominently displaying the current speaker or signer, crucial for clear comprehension in group settings. To date, spotlighting for sign language must be handled manually. Automating it would foster better engagement and participation from DHH individuals in virtual meetings, webinars, or educational settings, making it an indispensable element in digital communication platforms. This project focuses on developing an automated spotlighting feature that intelligently detects sign language turn-taking. This advancement aims to provide more accessible and equitable communication for the DHH community, by making sign language a first-class citizen in turn-taking, co-equal with spoken language. This initiative aligns with the accessibility principles advocated by the World Wide Web Consortium and addresses improvements asked for by deaf and hard of hearing consumers. The project leverages recent advancements in AI and Computer Vision, particularly in Sign Language Detection. It plays a crucial role in differentiating sign language from non-signing movements (gestures or hand signals), thereby reducing false positives and enhancing the user experience in videoconferencing.

Currently, intermittent catheterization is practiced by millions of individuals in the U.S. to manage conditions such as neurogenic bladder and lower urinary tract symptoms. While this practice enables individuals to reliably empty their bladders, it is associated with a high incidence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) even when single-use catheters are used. Safer closed catheter systems or no-touch catheters help reduce incidence of UTIs; however, they are cost-prohibitive and rarely covered by insurance. The CathBuddy system is an affordable alternative comprised of a reusable intermittent catheter, a removable catheter insertion aid, and an at-home sterilizer. This project conducts formative functional design testing with 20 CathBuddy system end users, where the users are tasked with cleaning and sterilizing CathBuddy catheters and insertion aids using a laboratory-verified protocol. Researchers evaluate end users’ ability to understand and implement the protocol instructions as well as remotely observe end users to assess the completeness of the protocol steps, the number of failed steps, and the objective cleanliness of the catheters following protocol completion. Project outcomes include a modified CathBuddy system that reduces UTI incidence relative to the existing standard of care, reduces plastic waste generated annually by catherization, and provides end users with a consistent and safer catherization system for day to day use that lowers UTI incidence resulting in improved user health and fewer secondary complications for individuals who use catherization systems",Brian  Bard,Program Manager,(202) 795-7298,brian.bard@acl.hhs.gov,Paul  Souvik,,(516) 270-8097,souvik@cathbuddy.com,,  ,

The long-term goal of this proposal is to reduce the burden of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors through developing paradigm shifting diagnostic tools. This proposal proposes to overcome these challenges by developing the first non-invasive extracellular vesicle (EV)-based assay for pLGG diagnosis with two specific aims: (1) developing nanomaterial-based technology for selective isolation of CNS-EV; (2) validate the nanomaterial-based technology in non-invasive molecular characterization of pLGG. Two-pronged approach will be used to achieve the milestones: (1) nanomaterial-based technology will be optimized to enrich CNS-EVs from plasma; (2) detecting clinically significant EV nucleic acid mutation from nanomaterial-isolated CNS-EVs from plasma of pLGG. This SBIR will result in (1) a nanomaterial-based kit for CNS-EV isolation; (2) proof-of-concept validation of non-invasive nanomaterial-based technology with pLGG plasma, which is ready for large clinical validation.

Schistosomiasis is second only to malaria in terms of socioeconomic and public health importance in the tropics and sub-tropics. In humans, it is mainly caused by infection with one of three species: Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, or S. japonicum. Infection occurs when skin encounters contaminated freshwater. Parasite cercariae penetrate the skin and over several weeks mature into adult worms that live in the blood vessels of the body and shed large numbers of eggs resulting in inflammation that can lead to end organ damage. The current gold standard of diagnosis is microscopy, as serology cannot yet distinguish between active and former infection. However, sensitivity of microscopy is low in light infections and regions of low endemicity. In this project, screening and point-of care serological tests will be developed.

However, only a minority (lt18%) of adult childhood cancer survivors obtain risk-based follow-up care. Transition readiness is a critical precursor to adult self-management of care, and adult self-management improves health status and reduces healthcare utilization. A growing body of research in other populations has generally shown positive associations between transition readiness and adherence to adult care and better health outcomes. While there is strong evidence demonstrating that the transition to adult-oriented healthcare is critical, there are few formal transition programs available, and no theoretically driven survivor-focused interventions. In this project, we will adapt and extend a prototype digital health intervention, Managing Your Health (MYH), that features guided peer mentor interaction with tailored expert content that addresses survivor-related barriers to transition readiness including inadequate knowledge of cancer treatment and late effect risks, lack of self-management skills, low self-efficacy for managing care, concern about impersonal relationships with adult providers, poor communication with parents and providers, and lower perceived priority of health compared with competing developmental pursuits.

A multitude of data such as single cell sequencing, digital pathology, and medical imaging are being generated to captures heterogeneityacross multiple scales. However, data is siloed and connections between scales remains elusive. SimBioSys PhenoScope is a novel research tool to harmonize these disparate data elements, connecting the genomic, cellular/pathway, microscropic tissue environment, and tissue scales. The tool is being developed for use in biomarker discovery. Combining state-of-the-artmachine learning, dimensionality reduction techniques, novel spatio-temporal simulation algorithms, and support for public data repositories, PhenoScope provides a new means of assessing factors contributing to a cancer's phenotypical behavior, thereby allowing elucidation of new pharmacodynamic, prognostic, predictive,and surrogate biomarkers. During the Phase II contract, a beta version of the application will be developed. Speciﬁc activities will include: 1) support for clinical outcomes data, 2) capabilities for users to bring their own data, 3) an interactive scripting/data exploration environment, 4) compatibility and cloud deployment enhancements, and 5) beta testing with customers.

We have recently developed a nanoliter-scale sample preparation platform termed nanoPOTS. When combined with ultrasensitive analysis, nanoPOTS enables profiling of hundreds to rt1000 proteins from single cells but currently involves several manual steps and multiple custom instruments that make it unsuitable for broad dissemination.

There is now substantial evidence supporting the role of the pro-inflammatory, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) as a major contributor to cognitive aging and other age-related diseases. Microglial senescence has profound consequences for neuronal activity and cognitive function in the normal aging brain and is known to be induced by exposure to radiation and to cancer chemotherapy. These studies have demonstrated the potential of senolytic agents to reduce chemotherapy induced microglial activation, reduce expression of SASP factors and to thereby improve age-associated, and cancer therapy-related cognitive impairment. The goal of this project is to develop the novel synthetic oleanane triterpenoid (SOT), CDDO-2P-Im (2P-Im), as an effective senotherapeutic for use in neuroprotection against therapeutic radiation (RT)-induced central nervous system (CNS) toxicity. The goal of this project is to develop the novel, orally bioavailable synthetic oleanane triterpenoid (SOT), CDDO-2P-Im (2P-Im), as senotherapeutic for use in neuroprotection against cancer therapy-induced cognitive aging. The proposed preclinical effort is designed to validate the oral administration 2P-Im will mitigate risk for therapy-related toxicity in target populations that include individuals undergoing either systemic chemotherapy or therapeutic irradiation (IR) of brain tumors and metastatic tumors affecting the central nervous system (CNS). The goals of this Phase I program are to clearly define the capacity of oral administration of CDDO-2P-Im to: 1). suppress therapy-induced production of SASP factors, 2). limit accumulation of senescent cells, and 3). prevent chronic microglial activation, thereby preserving cognitive function following administration of either chemotherapy (Aim 1) or radiation therapy (Aim 2) in mice.",  ,,,,JIN-KYU  CHOI,,(781) 789-2007,jletterio@triterptx.com,,  ,

To provide a first line defense at these sites, vaccines are being developed to induce pathogen-specific mucosal IgA, in addition to systemic immunity achieved by administered vaccines. Only mucosal vaccination can induce both mucosal and parenteral IgG/IgA. Currently, only a few adjuvants have been licensed as vaccine components in the U.S., which are either not ideally formulated for mucosal delivery or their mechanisms of action are not well-defined. Several hurdles must be overcome in developing practical subunit mucosal vaccines, including poor immunogenicity, degradation of vaccines in a harsh mucosal environment, delivery of vaccines to mucosal immune inductive tissue, and modulation of the mucosal immune environment to ensure that oral tolerance does not develop. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel mucosal adjuvant for oral vaccines against infectious diseases. Here we propose to tackle the above hurdles with three study components, i.e., 1) Further optimization of the novel molecular adjuvant C3d-CTB; 2) Evaluation of C3d-CTB efficacy in the context of an investigational new vaccine against Helicobacter pylori; and 3) Delivery of such novel H. pylori vaccine via oral route by the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a bio-encapsulation vehicl",  ,,,,Wenda  Gao,,(617) 347-3705,wendagao01@gmail.com,,  ,

However, early diagnosis, before the cancer has spread to other regions of the body, can increase patient treatment options and improve survival rates. One successful strategy for enabling early prostate cancer diagnosis is prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing, which measures PSA levels in blood. PSA levels are typically low unless there is a problem with the prostate, which can be an early indicator of prostate cancer. Unfortunately, current PSA tests are costly and require laboratory settings that are prohibitive to broad level screening, i.e., many men at risk for and many men who already have (undiagnosed) early-stage prostate cancer are not having their PSA levels tested and are subsequently missing critical prostate health care. Further, the current diagnostic threshold of these tests overdiagnoses (generates false positive results), which further burdens patients and providers. Thus, new PSA testing technology is needed. During this SBIR Phase I program, technology will be developed to enable point-of-care and at-home testing via a disposable, plug-and-play device that will use an improved qualitive threshold for diagnosis (PSArt10 ng/mL) and the associated qualitative readout to reduce false positives and do so at an affordable/accessible price-point of lt$20 per test.

Unwanted cells such as dead cells, doublet, or residual red blood cells will greatly reduce the effective data. Sample preparation of solid tissues into viable, non-red blood cells consists of three major steps: tissue dissociation, clump/debris filtration and single cells purification. Improvements been made to individual steps to enhance efficiency and reduce time. Though each step can be individually optimized to high completeness and efficiency, extensive pipetting and centrifugation operations are still required to bridge most, if not all, three steps. Therefore, the multistep, loosely monitored, attention-intensive process normally takes much longer in practice, and the material loss during the whole process can be rather high (from 10^8 to 10^4 -10^6 or 99%- 99.99%). Using Enrich TroVo technology, we believe eliminating intermediate steps while keeping all material in one place is a more effective strategy than improving the efficiency of individual steps. And we found the key of eliminating intermediate steps is to enhance the overall debris tolerance of the cell sorting process and to combine multiple purification goals into one single isolation step. Using image guided digital filter, multiple selection criteria such as viability, singularity, cell size, can be combined into one composite filter and directly applied to a complicated mixture of tissue digests. The purpose of this proposed project is to further specialize such image-based technology into a highthroughput, application ready product.

The landscape of PCa diagnosis and risk assessment is evolving due to a growing awareness of the limitations and potential harms associated with prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening. While early-stage PCa is highly treatable, overreliance on PSA screening has led to issues like false positives, unnecessary biopsies, and the overdiagnosis of non-life-threatening PCa. This underscores the pressing need for more precise and reliable risk assessment tools that can improve early detection while minimizing the adverse consequences of screening. Recent research emphasizes the vital role of the human microbiome in cancer initiation and progression. In this context, Oncobiomix has introduced an innovative microbiome signature score that has the potential to shift the paradigm for PCa risk assessment. This score evaluates the presence and abundance of specific gut microbiota associated with PCa, offering a novel tool compared to traditional PSA testing.

Chronic HBV infection causes almost 40% of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma. All small molecule drugs used in the current standard-of-care for treating chronic HBV are nucleoside/nucleotide analogs (NUC) and target the same single HBV protein, the polymerase (reverse transcriptase). Blocking active HBV replication through NUC treatment conceptually prevents the cycling of new genomes back to the nucleus to amplify or replenish cccDNA levels. However, existing pools of cccDNA have a sufficiently long half-life to maintain chronic infection despite years of potent antiviral suppression. Therefore, current NUC therapy significantly reduces serum HBV DNA levels but HBV continues to replicate in the liver, thereby enabling the infection to persist and progress. For this reason, the nucleoside/nucleotide analogs are not curative drugs. Their lifelong use is needed for sustained suppression of HBV, which furthermore causes adverse effects and resistance problems.

Studies show that frailty (quantified by the frailty index) and various gait characteristics such as gait speed or tests such as timed up and go (TUG) are predictors of mortality for surgical geriatric cancer patients. In addition, the neurotoxicity associated with some of the chemotherapy drugs can have a significant impact on the mobility and balance of the older patient increasing the risk of fall-related injuries, and hence, an objective assessment of patient's balance as part of a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) may be associated with cancer-related outcomes. However, given the time constraints in oncology clinics, many oncologists do not assess gait and balance of older adults with cancer. In this study, we propose to build on our earlier work to develop an easy-to-use point-of-care technology for objective gait assessment in geriatric cancer patients using computer vision.

Legionella is transmitted to people through inhalation of Legionella-containing water droplets.

This Phase 1 proposal aims to develop a prototype that drastically improves medical compression therapy through the major innovations: 1) the incorporation of dynamic external pressure waveforms with magnitudes and temporal and spatial frequencies that are optimized to enhance lymphatic contraction of the lymphatic pump; 2) realtime monitoring of tissue bioimpedance using novel flexible, wearable sensors to provide feedback of tissue water content to compression protocols for optimization of compression based on patient activity (e.g. sleeping, standing, sitting); and 3) incorporation of LymphaTech’s proprietary compression garment sizing and limb measurement volume technology to further enhance compression efficacy. Optimizing the delivery of lymphatic physiology-based compression waveforms combined with real-time feedback from embedded sensors is expected to dramatically increase the clinical efficacy of IPC for lymphedema patients.",  ,,,,MICHAEL  WEILER,,(703) 505-7720,mike@lymphatechnology.com,,  ,

Although rabies vaccines have been developed for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), remote communities are disproportionally susceptible to the life-threatening infection. In these communities, access to the requisite healthcare facilities is limited, and there are high costs and complex regimens associated with the treatment. Further, current vaccines require maintenance of cold chain and bulky packaging. Vaccine delivery administered intradermally using a dissolvable microneedle approach could result in key benefits such as reduced packaging and administrative needs, along with dose sparing cost savings. Challenges remain within the development of disposable microneedles for vaccine delivery, including maintenance of antigen stability without the need for cold chain and device sterilization. Luna proposes to address these limitations through development of the AntiDoSE microneedle patch. The technology builds upon existing work at Luna, and the stabilizing matrix is expected to reduce cold chain requirements while exhibiting antimicrobial behavior and controlled antigen release during dissolution. The proposed Phase I program includes objectives aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of the novel excipient for microneedle delivery of the human rabies vaccine.",  ,,,,Lindsay  Woodard,,(434) 220-1559,woodard@lunainc.com,,  ,

Most cases of EAC are preceded by Barrett's esophagus (BE). Current guidelines recommend routine endoscopic surveillance followed by ablation or resection of high grade dysplasia (HGD) lesions. However, the standard white light endoscopic surveillance requires extensive random biopsies resulting in an inaccurate approach with up to 40% of patients with HGD having undetected EAC, despite undergoing this surveillance as indicated. This proposal develops a fluorescence-based endoscopic imaging platform to image a novel imaging agent, pegulicianine, that is activated by molecular alterations associated with cancer. This novel platform is aimed at accurately detect, in real-time and in-situ, dysplasia within a background of BE. This approach may obviate the need for repeated surveillance with random biopsies. Through this method of early detection of esophageal precancers, the incidence of EAC and cancer-related mortality may be reduced.

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a rare pediatric cancer, with an incidence in the US of 300 to 400 new cases per year, more than half of which are in children less than 10 years old. RMS treatment usually involves a combination of treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy, and RT. Almost 20% of children with RMS have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Metastasis is a major cause of treatment failure and death. Despite heavy multi-modal therapeutic regimens, metastatic RMS has a dismal prognosis, with 5-year survival rates of less than 30% and those with bone or bone marrow metastases or metastases in more than 3 sites have survival rates of lt10%. Their prognosis has not improved in decades and novel therapies are desperately needed to halt tumor progression and reduce long term side effects in these young patients.

Currently, to enter braille directly into a smart tablet braille writers tap fingers against the small keyboard displayed on the smooth glass, resulting in fingers breaking contact with the screen as they type. This can be particularly troublesome for novice users as they may lose orientation and tap outside the small keyboard region of the corresponding keys causing errors and interruptions. The Kinetic Braille Keyboard Adapter allows users to maintain continuous contact with all of the keys, so orientation is never lost thus eliminating errors caused by shifting finger positions. As users press down on the nine spring-loaded keys, conductive finger-tip sized pegs protruding from the underside of the keys strike the touchscreen, creating electrical pathways between the user’s fingers and the touchscreen surface, to activate on-screen virtual buttons. When finger pressure is reduced, the spring-loaded keys move back to the “up” position, breaking contact with the screen, to produce the desired letter. This project conducts a field test with eight teachers of students with visual disabilities who write and read braille. Researchers measure students’ speed and accuracy in typing words and phrases in braille using the Kinetic Braille Keyboard Adapter mounted on an iPad Mini compared to equivalent tasks using an iPad with a virtual braille keyboard only.

Multi-parametric (mpMRI) is the current standard-of-care to diagnose and triage indolent versus aggressive PCa for treatment according to PIRADS criteria. However, mpMRI diagnosis is based on a qualitative assessment that does not quantify the inherently multi-exponential diffusion and relaxation processes in cancerous tissue. To quantify mpMRI of the prostate, phantom materials are needed to optimize and standardize acquisition protocols. We will demonstrate novel phantom materials with a microstructure similar to PCa. Colloidal suspensions of lamellar vesicles, embedded within a hydrogel matrix, mimic the multi-compartment water contribution to the image voxel signal in the PCa environment. These gel structures can be cast to arbitrary shapes and can be mass-produced for clinical use during patient scans. This will eliminate the need for bulky phantom housings or additional reference scan time when performing reference measurements with the phantom materials. CIRS will demonstrate the utility of these materials in Phase I by prototyping a Quantitative mpMRI System Phantom and an MRI Radiomics Prostate Phantom.

To accelerate wide clinical adoption of FLASH RT, it is essential to address the challenges associated with precise dosimetry and real-time beam monitoring for Ultra-High Dose Rate (UHDR) radiation treatments. We propose to solve this technical gap in FLASH RT by introducing a newly invented imaging concept, namely ionizing radiation acoustic imaging (iRAI). As validated in our preliminary studies, iRAI offers a unique and practical tool for mapping the dose deposition during RT, and holds a great potential to address the challenges associated with precise dosimetry and real-time beam monitoring for FLASH RT. The goal of this research is to develop an iRAI-based ultrafast dosimetry system for 3D mapping of accumulated radiation dose during FLASH RT in real time with single-pulse resolution and characterizing the time structure of the radiation beam. By leveraging the unique advantages of iRAI technology in mapping radiation beams, including high resolution, high imaging speed, and high accuracy, our proposed ultrafast volumetric dosimetry system, once validated, could provide a practical and cost-effective solution for quality assurance in FLASH RT.",  ,,,,ROY  CLARKE,,7343580444,royc@umich.edu,,  ,

There are no FDA cleared directly injectable paramagnetic imaging agents for human use. A number of FDA cleared biocompatible, gas permeable polymers exist which could be used to separate the body environment from the imaging agent environment, while still retaining the oxygen sensitivity.

While survivorship care may exist in academic centers, an implementation gap remains to provide this care seamlessly to survivors regardless of cancer type and providers. Patient navigators can address this gap. However, the absence of integrated approaches to reduce the cognitive and time burden of navigation-related tasks has significantly strained the capacity of these resources, who traditionally have not been focused on survivorship. Our goal is to develop and evaluate a patient navigation platform focusing on facilitating navigation tasks in the later stages of the cancer care continuum, creating an integrated survivorship care plan and enabling communication, care coordination and education. Special emphasis is put on integration into existing workflows and IT infrastructure. The proposed approach is particularly adapted, given its mobile infrastructure, to address the needs of survivors in both urban and rural communities including those where access to cancer treatment and follow-up may be challenging, leading to inferior outcomes.

Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) is a rare skin cancer with few therapeutic options. Immunomodulation of TME can improve responses to current therapies by re-activating suppressed immune cell activity. Tranquility intends to combine an attenuated strain of Brucella melitensis, Bm∆vjbR, with a genetically engineered biosynthetic cluster that includes the enzyme toluene ortho-monooxygenase (Bm∆vjbR-TOM). This allows conversion of tryptophan to hydroxyindole (HI), a potent immunomodulatory compound. Preliminary data has shown that treatment of tumor cells with HI promotes tumor suppressive immunomodulatory effects including activation of pro-inflammatory macrophages, cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells, and promotion of tumor-suppressive CD4+ T-cell differentiation. Importantly, Bm∆vjbR has also been tested for safety in immunosufficient and immunodeficient mice, as well as non-human primates and pregnant goats and sheep. In each of these systems, the bacterium displayed exceptional safety profiles. To validate the potential of Bm∆vjbR-TOM for the development of a bacterial anticancer therapeutic, the Bm∆vjbR strain will first be engineered to express the TOM enzyme through genomic integration, and TOM enzymatic activity will be validated through chromogenic assays. Then, the anticancer efficacy of the resultant strain will be characterized against MCC tumor growth in immune-competent as well as humanized NOD/SCID mouse models. Upon completion of this proposal, proof of concept for Bm∆vjbR-TOM as a new potential candidate for anticancer therapeutic development will be demonstrated.",  ,,,,SONGLEE  HAN,,9795711552,tranquility23ad@gmail.com,,  ,

We propose to develop a one-handed, environmental surface-sampling and concentration device– the Squeegee-Aspirator for Surface Sampling (SASS). Brushing, squeegee, and vacuum actions recover water or wetting buffer after being used to “wash” surfaces, and its effective, fast and near-complete liquid sample collection means that the sample is immediately available for extraction and molecular detection. Super-absorbent beads also concentrate the recovered fluid.

We will focus on a naturally lytic phage named Muddy, previously shown to improve clinical outcomes in a cystic fibrosis patient with disseminated M. abscessus infections in combination with other two engineered phages. Engineered bacteriophages will then be assessed for their ability to internalize within mammalian cells including alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages. Phages demonstrating the highest internalization efficiency will undergo further testing to evaluate their ability to infect and kill intracellular bacteria.

Design changes – to incorporate new hardware technologies or methods - may trigger the need for clinical trials to ensure safety and assess performance. Conducting a clinical trial is not only expensive, but often takes years for patient recruitment and study. Utilizing physical phantoms, rather than patients, would be faster, far less expensive, reduces risk to patients and potentially increases the speed with which life-saving technological advances are made available to the public. Currently, commercially available compressed and uncompressed breast phantoms do not produce realistic breast images; rather they provide basic breast shapes with no anatomical information. Utilizing access to a large data set (over 200) of three-dimensional real patient breast CT images at UC Davis, and a novel approach to phantom development, we propose to fill this need.

For 50 years, clinical trials in DIPG have been an abject failure; however, recently GD2-CAR-T therapy has shown promise in small DIPG clinical studies. A new paradigm for the treatment of DIPG is proposed using tumor-targeted mimics of a powerful immune stimulating cytokine IL-12, naturally found in the body. As a therapeutic, IL-12 bridges innate and adaptive immunity in human clinical trials but severe systemic toxicities limit the ability to achieve maximum benefit. This proposal radically engineers IL-12 so its biological activity is conditional to binding GD2 uniquely expressed on DIPG tumors. Instead of IL-12 protein, we use high content screening of macrocyclic peptidomimetic libraries containing 10^14 compounds to create completely new compounds that mimic IL-12, bioactivity, allowing precise chemistry-based tools to 1) conditionally activate IL-12R signaling upon GD2-binding (creating an AND gate), 2) minimize systemic exposure via tunable pharmacokinetics and 3) increase tumor penetration by minimizing molecular weight.

Third, we train and test the AI system using two learning regimes: learning to segment intra-tumoral structures and learning to segment glioma sub-regions. Finally, we produce heat maps to visualize the features extracted by the AI, thus offering physicians a view of AI's attention patterns and activation maps that were triggered during AI's decision-making.

The passive, continuously measured data streams generated by current or future COTS sensors will allow direct/indirect measures of cancer progression and its symptoms. Increased out-of-clinic patient and clinician engagement via these tools will allow more precise delivery of cancer care after as well as during cancer remission. Ultimately, these passive sensing platforms’ data for digital biomarkers will afford clinicians: 1) more objective metrics of response to therapeutics; 2) control and autoreporting of symptoms and their fluctuations; 3) monitoring of side-effects of experimental or standard of care therapies; and 4) more ecologically valid clinical endpoints, all decreasing assessment burden via increased continuity of physiological measurement sampling and patient context in the ambulatory setting. Furthermore, such data present an opportunity to measure population-based statistics from large cohorts of cancer patients by way of the myriad of devices currently available or being developed. Unfortunately, despite the availability of a myriad of COTS wearables capable of measuring physiological variables, their use for remote cancer patient monitoring or for out-of-clinic cancer research is yet to become mainstream. There is a considerable need for scalable informatics tools that allow automated data aggregation, integration and machine learning/artificial intelligence (AI)/predictive analytics that can pull from disparate data sets across COTS device vendors and have the flexibility to add new measures as they are developed. Furthermore, a central software platform is needed that could obtain wearable or external device data and uniformly compare/contrast/couple data streams to understand physiology versus patient context with respect to time: such a capability will substantially advance this unique approach to aid cancer patients, clinician assessment and clinical trial design. This work seeks to overcome these bottlenecks and provide a workflow and an infrastructure for out-of-clinic remote patient monitoring and online research collaboration for advancing population-based research.

The goal of this project is to design and construct a novel NIST-traceable ionization chamber for FLASH dosimetry. We will also develop a standards-level electrometer to achieve high frequency monitoring of the measured signal, providing both integrated dose measurements for the entire irradiation and time-resolved information about individual pulses delivered during FLASH irradiations. Both instruments will be NIST traceable. To reach this goal, we aim to determine the optimal ionization chamber design for FLASH RT, to use one of our existing electrometers as a springboard for creating a new electrometer that responds rapidly to FLASH irradiation, and to fully characterize a working prototype system in FLASH beamlines. Although we plan to verify performance in both proton and electron FLASH beams, the ultimate test of an ion chamber developed for absolute dosimetry in FLASH beams will be in electron FLASH beamlines because these have the highest instantaneous dose rates and dose per pulse of the available modalities.",  ,,,,SHANNON  HOLMES,,(608) 824-7816,sholmes@standardimaging.com,,  ,

Compared with HIV protein vaccines, they can be rapidly produced with reduced development time and costs by using a common manufacturing platform and purification methods. The antigen would be expressed in situ, allowing for transmembrane domains and multimeric complexes to be formed and more naturally presented to the immune system to illicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. Compared with DNA vaccine, mRNA vaccine only requires cytosolic delivery and do not have the potential risk of integration of exogenous DNA into host genome, which makes mRNA a more promising nucleic acid immunogen. In addition, saRNA has been shown to induce protein expression for up to 60 days and elicit immune responses with lower dosing than conventional mRNA. Despite these advantages of saRNA, due to its large size and negative charge, a potent, well-tolerated delivery system facilitating efficient cellular uptake and degradation protection is needed for the development of saRNA-based vaccine.

Of particular interest are reagents to be used in canine models of spontaneously occurring cancer that would facilitate the usefulness of dogs with such cancers in developing and evaluating human cancer therapeutics. The creation of such reagents would add value to this unique immune competent model by enabling studies to be performed in dogs with cancer that shed light on potential correlative biomarkers that may then inform human clinical trial design.

In the United States, of the endemic mycoses, histoplasmosis was the most common cause for hospitalization and death. Histoplasmosis can cause a wide spectrum of manifestations that range from subclinical infections to more severe progressive disseminated disease, particularly for immunosuppressed individuals. Currently, diagnosis of histoplasmosis relies on demonstration of the fungus in clinical specimens by histopathology or culture, which can take weeks to provide a result. This makes early diagnosis impossible and has resulted in a common and widespread practice of starting antifungals prophylactically or empirically, in the absence of any confirmation of fungal infection or disease. Although this approach is considered “standard of care” by many treating physicians, this also results in unnecessary antifungal drug treatment, adverse drug reactions, and increased healthcare expenditure. Therefore, early diagnosis is critical for successful and efficient treatment of histoplasmosis. Zymeron’s POC Histoplasmosis diagnostic test provides a rapid, noninvasive, and highly sensitive method allowing physicians to make rapid diagnosis in the absence of culture or pathological confirmation and also offers an option for monitoring treatment response.",  ,,,,Yan  Zhou,,(919) 748-3319,sbir@zymeron.com,,  ,

Adjuvance's semi-synthetic saponin adjuvant TiterQuil-1055 (TQL1055) has shown remarkable efficacy with a variety of antigens with no detectable reactogenicity. When combined with 3 of the leading vaccines against influenza (Fluzone, Fluarix and Flublok) striking augmentation of the antibody response against the A/H3N2 hemagglutinin (HA) antigen and more than 4-fold vaccine dose saving was seen with all 3 vaccines but this was most striking with the most defined and least immunogenic vaccine, Flublok. The objectives of this Phase 1 proposal are 1) to determine if this augmentation applies to the other 2 antigens in Flu vaccines, A/H1N1 and B; 2) to determine if it applies to the T-cell responses, 3) to conduct an IND enabling stability study of Flublok/1055 and 4) to determine whether mixture of TQL1055 and Flublok with additional immunological adjuvants further augments the serologic or especially T-cell response to the HA antigen.

Multiple sources consulted have cited a COVID-19 RT-PCR specimen container failure rate of 2-2.5%. Calculated with the CDC’s record of more than 125 million administered RT-PCR COVID-19 tests, this means that approximately 2.5 – 3.1 million administered COVID-19 tests have been compromised. The need clearly exists for a lowcost, easily-fieldable, and robust specimen-containment solution that will provide positive feedback to the user upon proper closure, and withstand environmental changes encountered during transport. In response to this significant need, Luna Innovations and its collaborators propose the Speci-Lock System: A positive-feedback, aftermarket closure solution designed to interface with a wide variety of existing screwtop specimen containers. In addition to providing tactile and audible feedback of proper closure to a user, Speci-Lock is also designed with a pressure-sensitive gasket that increases sealing force with increased pressures experienced during transit. The overall purpose of the Speci-Lock program is to design, develop, produce, and commercialize a novel biological specimen containment solution which will eliminate containment failure due to user error and environmental conditions.

Background Information The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance the treatment of cancer using laser plasma accelerator physics breakthroughs at LBNL to build a miniature electron accelerator as a variable Xrays source with clinically relevant dose-rates of ~0.7 Gy/min and energies between 0.25 – 5 MeV. This electronic particle brachytherapy source is powered by a commercial, laser system, operating up to 1000 Hz and 7 W of average power. The flexibility of the laser driver allows treatment with radioisotope-free operation and variable x-ray energy on a pulse-by-pulse basis. This confers extra degrees of freedom for the treatment planning process thus providing the clinician the ability to improve the dose delivery. Unwanted dose to nearby healthy tissue and critical structures is reduced. This proposal brings a world-class team together: LBNL in laser plasma accelerators and optical fiber-based delivery systems, Woodtoga to translate the technology into clinically relevant products with expertise in bonding and the creation of miniature X-ray devices, and Varian Medical Systems as the commercial partner.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for better testing methods. Here, MBio proposes a method of obtaining sensitive and quantitative results in a test that takes less than 1.5 days and only detects viable bacteria. Speciation and serotyping are also performed within this time. The test includes a 30-hour culturing step followed by a simple assay to determine the presence or absence of rRNA from Legionella. This nucleic assay can discriminate between different Legionella species. When Legionella is detected, an immunoassay reflex test can be run on the same assay platform for serotyping.

The aims of this proposal are to validate the calibration of our integrated RF beam monitor for absolute charge and absolute dose under FLASH irradiation conditions, and to demonstrate a basic closed loop feedback system capable of interrupting the beam between pulses based on the detected signal.

Compared with HIV protein vaccines, they can be rapidly produced with reduced development time and costs by using a common manufacturing platform and purification methods. The antigen would be expressed in situ, allowing for transmembrane domains and multimeric complexes to be formed and more naturally presented to the immune system to illicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. Compared with DNA vaccine, mRNA vaccine only requires cytosolic delivery and do not have the potential risk of integration of exogenous DNA into host genome, which makes mRNA a more promising nucleic acid immunogen. In addition, saRNA has been shown to induce protein expression for up to 60 days and elicit immune responses with lower dosing than conventional mRNA. Despite these advantages of saRNA, due to its large size and negative charge, a potent, well-tolerated delivery system facilitating efficient cellular uptake and degradation protection is needed for the development of saRNA-based vaccine.

The success of radiotherapy stems from the exploit of a therapeutic window in tumor response and normal tissue tolerance which maximizes the chance of sterilizing the tumor while sparing the surrounding normal tissue from severe damage. This requires an accurate and individualized radiation dose distribution generated from the examination of the patient’s medical images. Radiation therapy is technically complex and labor intensive. Intensive human supervision and intervention are needed throughout the path of patient care. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies are adept at automating workflows and tasks—in this case the development of cancer treatment plans. We believe that this machine learning has incredible potential to address inherent problems in the existing treatment planning workflow. Our approach will mitigate the current issues with treatment planning, integrate seamlessly with day-to-day operations, and will serve as a treatment solution that benefits patients in a way that limits their risk and extends their lives.

Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic mode of regulated cell death, has produced intriguing therapeutic responses in tumor models, exploiting tumor-related metabolic reprogramming to selectively kill tumor cells. ACC cells are highly susceptible to ferroptosis and exhibit elevated surface expression of SCARB1. Therefore, exploration of a dual-selective formulation is warranted. Activities will be divided into three sequential aims: (1) optimizing nanoparticle encapsulation of ferroptosis-inducing agents, (2) evaluating ferroptotic potential in relevant cell lines, and (3) demonstrating tumor effect in a murine model of ACC.

These services can be provided at no or minimal cost to the employer, minimizing or eliminating one of the key barriers expressed by small employers. Employees benefit from access to discounted products (e.g., meals or sports equipment) or services (e.g., gym membership). Businesses providing these wellness services can also experience economic benefits via increased patronage and improved integration with and exposure to the community. Improved employee health, in turn, can lead to foreseeable economic and social benefits, such as increased productivity, reduced health care costs, reduced absenteeism, reduced short and long-term disability, and reduced workers compensation claims. In short, employer-sponsored wellness activities facilitate healthy lifestyle behaviors and reduce employees’ health risks and costs.

Few effective drug treatment options exist for ovarian cancer and other rare cancers whereas 300+ drugs have been approved by the FDA to treat non-rare cancers. Analysis of tumor mRNA gene expression has the potential to identify over expression of approved drug targets, such as HER2, AR, and PD-L1, and silencing of DNA repair genes that make ovarian tumors more responsive to PARP inhibitors. In this project, a proprietary tumor mRNA sequencing method called “OneRNA” will be analytically validated in 30 clinically annotated de-identified ovarian tumors by (1) comparing relative mRNA expression levels (tumor vs normal) to reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) (2) evaluating concordance of aberrantly expressed genes detected with the OneRNA assay with FDA approved immunohistochemical (IHC) assays. Based on preliminary data, we expect to identify at least one clinically actionable aberrantly expressed gene in over 90% of tumors. The resulting data will support the launch of an ovarian tumor expression analysis service by the Genomic Expression CLIA lab to help oncologists identify which drugs and drug combinations are likely to benefit ovarian cancer patients.",  ,,,,Morton  PEDERSEN,,(917) 863-4364,mlp@genomicexpression.com,,  ,

Thus, conventional therapies such as radiation remain the standard-of-care for most patients. A major drawback of radiation therapy (RT) is the creation of therapy induced senescent (TIS) cells that exhibit a pro-tumor senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) state. However, RT could be transformed into anti-tumor targeted immunotherapy using DNA damage response (DDR) inhibitors and/or senotherapeutic drugs. The pharmaceutical industry is pursuing DDR inhibitor + radiation combination therapies. But, current DDR inhibitors lack precise cancer targeting and are often too toxic to normal tissue. The drug we will advance with this proposal will be a first-in-class irreversible inhibitor of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a uniquely cancer-specific DDR target that’s in ~90% of tumors but negligible in normal tissue. In a proof-of-concept study, the TERT inhibitor will be demonstrated as a potent radiosensitizer and senomorphic agent that induces an anti-tumor immune response in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in vivo. This should justify the full preclinical development of our TERT inhibitor, which may eventually bring cancer-specific therapy sensitizers to the clinic for not just NSCLC, but potentially most cancers.",  ,,,,GRANT  FROST,,(651) 380-6189,gfrost.riptidetherapeutics@gmail.com,,  ,

As such, cell culture is moving to 3D tissue models, focusing on their in vivo-like properties as opposed to earlier 2D culture. Degradable membranes are porous and can contain fibrillar structures similar to those found in nature, while also providing structural support to cells. As cells and tissue grow on a membrane, their extracellular matrix can fill the pores and replace the function of the degrading membrane, resulting in a free-standing tissue for experimentation. To that end, biodegradable membranes will be incorporated into a novel cell culture insert with designs that can be automated for manufacture and extended from 6 to 96 well plates or more.
