This means that the reliance on delivery has significantly increased in all forms of delivery – the big delivery companies grew and expanded their service, independent, Uber-like services appeared and captured a significant portion of the market, and drop-off solutions have spread around the country, used as safe boxes for the items, with the recipient of the delivery being able to open the safe using a code received from the safe box operator. Side by side to the growth in the need of improved delivery methods, there is a persistent need of improved inventory management, needed to ensure that the correct items are shipped to their recipients, as well as to improve factory workers, service providers, and other people in the supply chain’s ability to improve their inventory management, reduce delivery/inventory management time, and more. These items need to be locked and secured, allowing access only to those who have the permission to access it. In most cases, traditional keys are used, presenting a potential security weak spot – keys tend to be stolen/misplaced, and should a master key reach the hands of malicious factors, could even be dangerous to the organization. BoxLock has developed a QR-based lock, allowing only those with the correct code access to the locked items or areas. The QR can be personal, generated on incident, and provide improved security – if a QR code reaches the hands of a malicious factor or is lost by a user, the specific code can immediately be removed from the system, while at a similar situation, using physical keys, the locks must be replaced, in a process that costs more money and takes a longer time to complete, in which the organization is vulnerable. BoxLock seamlessly integrates across multiple administrative, material management and supply chain software solutions. This enables third party platforms to monitor lock status, perform advance barcode and parcel management and execute real-time triggers on lock activities.",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,support@afwerx.af.mil,Andrew  Kelley,,(512) 364-5133,andrew@getboxlock.com,,  ,

Dashboard for real-time school and school-district level reporting on student learning progress. The aims for this
Phase II project are to show that the solution delivers the following learner benefits: (1) effective mastery of the
fundamentals of genomics/genetics and personalized medicine, (2) effective understanding of the ethical and
healthcare implications of genetics/genomics, (3) motivational impact on students, by promoting interest in
genomics/STEM education and careers, (4) strong learning and motivational impact on underrepresented

A large portion of the CO2 emitted each year in the United States is released from distributed sources, like cars, smaller factories, and farms. Direct capture of CO2 from ambient air is therefore necessary for the eventual reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. However, capturing the CO2 in ambient air presents a great challenge due to the dilute nature of the CO2, requiring different strategies than carbon capture from concentrated CO2 waste streams. We propose a novel process for the capture and containment of CO2 from air into a purified, concentrated CO2 stream that can be redirected for use as a feedstock for a wide variety of applications, including chemical manufacturing and syngas formation. The CO2 is captured in a concentrated KOH solution using a high-surface area contactor to form potassium carbonate. The potassium carbonate is then efficiently electrolyzed in a hydrogen-assisted process that reduces the operating potential, increasing the electrical efficiency of the process while generating concentrated and purified CO2. Water, hydrogen, and KOH are also regenerated as byproducts that can be recycled back into the CO2 capture and electrolysis processes, reducing both overall energy and chemical consumption. This process has the potential for large scale-up, with no environmental limitations and virtually no chemical waste generated.

19 have triggered an unprecedented decline in the number of visits to ambulatory practices. The repercussions
have impacted not only those with the disease, but the many millions of older persons in need of healthcare who
forego in-person visits in fear of infection or for socioeconomic reasons. While the precipitating need for
alternative healthcare delivery methods has hastened the adoption of software solutions, such as Zoom,
traditional videoconferencing services fail to compensate for the lack of direct physical evaluations with a patient
that is needed for evaluating musculoskeletal (MSK) deficits, planning therapeutic interventions, and guiding
exercise compliance—essential components of evidence-based practice among rehabilitation practitioners. To
overcome these shortcomings, our team of computer vision and human movement engineers is partnering with
orthopedic rehabilitation specialists at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) to develop a telehealth platform
that fuses high resolution RGB and Depth (RGD-D) video data readily obtainable from a modern smartphone
to facilitate quantitative, MSK assessment. The innovation builds upon our work in computing movement
outcome measures from vision-based body tracking algorithms, and our skills in augmented reality (AR)
software development to enhance a clinician’s assessment and exercise instruction capabilities. Our pilot data
demonstrate that accurate quantitative rehabilitation outcomes are obtainable using RGB-D body tracking
algorithms during a sub-set of knee activities. Phase I will advance these capabilities by deriving and validating
the accuracy of 3D body tracking and rehabilitation outcome measures during a wider set of activities used
clinically for assessing knee mobility, alignment, posture, balance, strength, and function from depth enabled
smartphone video recordings in control subjects (Aim 1). Aim 2 will develop a proof-of-concept AR telehealth
platform with the help of the MGH team that delivers an enhanced telehealth experience through real-time
synchronized audio-visual processing, real-time display of quantitative rehabilitation outcomes for the therapist
to assess deficits or guide exercise compliance, and instructional animations for the patient to safely carry out
the rehabilitation activities. The proof-of-concept prototype will undergo feasibility testing in Aim 3 among n=5
physical therapists and n=10 patients with knee OA during a simulated telehealth session to achieve high ratings
for usability, accessibility, and effectiveness. The results will inform the user-requirements of a more complete
Phase II telehealth platform designed in close collaboration with industry partners to provide secure cloud based
communication for seamless interoperability between devices; additional examination tools (e.g. gait analysis);
a broader range of baseline assessment and therapeutic exercise protocols for additional MSK conditions; and
HIPAA-compliant deployment and electronic documentation management. The final prototype system will be
evaluated during actual telehealth visits at multiple clinical sites to promote safe and effective clinical care.PROJECT NARRATIVE
With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical care has by necessity shifted towards telehealth delivery for
people at risk due to age, who live in underserved communities or avoid in-person visits out of fear of viral
transmission. Existing telehealth software platforms are generally supportive of videoconferencing but have yet
to provide rehabilitation professionals with quantitative outcomes typically obtained from direct physical
evaluations with a patient. To overcome this shortcoming, we are developing an augmented reality platform
that fuses RGB and depth imaging from a patient’s smartphone to deliver quantitative outcomes of knee joint
mobility, alignment, posture, balance, strength and function during a telehealth visit to support the mandate for
more effective remote delivery of evidence-based rehabilitation during the global pandemics and beyond.",  ,,,,PAOLA  CONTESSA,,(508) 545-8236,pcontessa@altecresearch.com,,  ,

Low oxygen (hypoxic) environments are known to be important for maintaining the small
number of adult stem cells in the human body, such as in bone marrow. These conditions are
also believed to enable dormant cancer cells to survive and metastasize years or decades after
the original tumor has been destroyed and the reason why bone marrow is one of the most
common sites of cancer metastasis. Understanding of these conditions can drive the
development of 3D cellular scaffolds for growing stem cells ex vivo, thus reducing the burden on
requiring bone marrow transplants, and for developing therapeutics that prevent cancer relapse.
This project proposes to develop the first quantitative oxygen tomographic imaging system
called BONES (Bio-tissue Oxygenation Nanophosphor Enabled Sensing) to address the critical
need for high resolution imaging of oxygen concentrations in hypoxic (low oxygen) tissues such
as bone marrow. The technique is based on developments in x-ray luminescence computed
tomography, an emerging molecular imaging technique capable of achieving cellular level
resolution and high sensitivities. The approach uses x-rays to excite oxygen-sensitive
nanophosphors that emit near-infrared photons to finally enable 3D oxygen measurements in
deep bone marrow.
Because the technique requires a multidisciplinary team with x-ray expertise, nanophosphor
expertise, near-infrared detection expertise, and algorithms for quantifying the concentrations
and minimizing dose, this STTR fast-track proposal involves several institutions with deep
expertise in their respective domains. The proposed Phase I 6-month project is a proof-of-
principle demonstration of a breadboard system used on nanophosphors in low oxygen
solutions and embedded in bone. The proposed Phase II 24-month project is to develop a
complete prototype system and experimentally verify its performance.Project Narrative

3D oxygen measurements in deep bone marrow based on a newly developed technique called x-
ray luminescence computed tomography (XLCT) and oxygen-sensitive nanophosphors for 10 to

Aqueous Systems
Project Summary: This SBIR phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of in situ
remediation of heavy metals Pb(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), Hg(II), Ni(II), Cr(VI), As(V), and Sb(V)
contaminated soils and aqueous systems using novel green Fe-P nanoparticles synthesized using
a proprietary (US Patent Pending) process. The widespread contamination of soils, surface
waters, and ground water with heavy metal(loid)s currently represents one of the most severe
environmental problems that can seriously affect environmental quality and human health. The
project is particularly pertinent to contaminated soils, sediments and groundwater such as for the
USS lead superfund site. Current and ongoing clean up of the USS lead superfund site located in
East Chicago and Indiana is via direct excavation of contaminated soils to landfills costing in
excess of 100 million dollars. The disturbance to the environment and workers exposure to toxic
metals is much higher during the excavation, removal, and storage of contaminated soil to
landfills w/o solving the contamination problem. Thus next generation, green, and cost-effective
in situ remediation approaches with a clear impact on human health are needed. As part of the
proposed SBIR phase I work, we will determine optimal Fe-P dosage to achieve remediation
efficacy in soil and aqueous systems to meet EPA mandated MCL for respective metalloids and
show the efficacy of this approach in real world samples of contaminated ground water.
Unique advantages of our technology include: 1) The proposed Fe-P nanoparticles unlike current
Fe based nanoparticles are based on a new paradigm and are effective in remediating all trace
metals in contaminated soils and groundwater; 2) while being an order of magnitude more cost-
effective than current state of the art; itandapos;s synthesis is simple using a green process. They are
similar to natural minerals found in soils (unlike nanozerovalent Fe) thus there is no concern
with bioaccumulation or other adverse effects on human health; and 3) Fe-P nanoparticles utilize
dual Fe-OH2+ and O-PO43- functional groups enabling permanent binding of cationic and anionic
metalloids enabling a one step solution to mixed metal contamination (as is often the case).
Unlike nZVFe and other iron based nanoparticles, they do not aggregate or need external
stabilizers and do not corrode. This would guarantee stability compared to the current state of the
art where immobilized phases are not very stable with low dissociation energies. Finally,
reductive immobilization of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) and As(V) to As(III) is not uniformly helpful
because while the reduced Cr(III) is less toxic than Cr(VI); the reduced As(III) is much more
toxic than As(V) form.Project Narrative: Heavy metals are toxic with acute and chronic health effects. Human health is severely
impacted by exposures to heavy metals such as As, Cd, Hg and Pb that can be toxic even at trace levels. Lead is
a neurotoxin and can damage hematopoietic, renal and skeletal systems. Cadmium can be toxic at very low
concentration and because of its long half life of 15-30 years tends to accumulate in blood, kidneys, liver and
reproductive organs. Mercury is highly reactive and toxic and can cause damage to several organs including the
kidneys, endocrine system, and the central nervous system. Hexavalent chromium exposure has been
documented to cause several short-term and intermediate effects including, but not limited to, respiratory
irritation, nosebleeds, asthma, sensitization, skin burns and dermatitis. Inorganic arsenic has been confirmed as
a human carcinogen that can induce skin, lung, and bladder cancer.",  ,,,,NADIA  ADAM,,(574) 222-1332,nadam@biomineralsystems.com,,  ,

The goal of this SBIR fast-track application is to carry out a number of IND enabling studies on our siRNA drug
candidate, which is designed to treat non-alcohol steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is a form of non-alcohol fatty
liver disease (NAFLD) and results from a pathological accumulation of fat in the liver. Approximately 5 million
people have been diagnosed with NASH in the US alone. NASH can lead to cirrhosis, followed by liver failure or
hepatocellular carcinoma. The projected number of diagnosed NASH patients worldwide is about 16 million. The
current primary treatment for NASH is lifestyle change. However, few patients remain adherent for extended
periods of time. No drugs have been approved in the US or other countries for treating NASH.
To address this unmet medical need, we are taking the innovative approach of treating NASH by increasing
mitochondrial metabolism in the liver. Fatty acids are transported to the liver where they are metabolized in
mitochondria through -oxidation, which is coupled to the electron transport chain (ETC) and mitochondrial
respiration. Increasing the activity of the ETC in the liver could therefore speed up the degradation of fatty acids
and prevent their accumulation in the liver. A key endogenous negative regulator of the ETC is the MCJ protein
(MCJ/DnaJC15 or Methylation-Controlled J protein). MCJ is a mitochondrial protein that acts as a brake on the
ETC (“internal mitochondrial brake”). We have demonstrated that removal of MCJ is safe and results in increased
mitochondrial respiration without increasing the generation of reactive oxygen species. This is because removal
of MCJ minimizes electron leak by promoting the formation of respiratory supercomplexes.
In preliminary studies, we used mouse specific siRNAs to show safety of our approach and efficacy for reversal
and prevention of pathologies that are associated with NASH, using multiple mouse models of NASH. siRNA
has been validated as a drug for a number of diseases, with two siRNA drugs recently approved by FDA for
treatment of liver diseases (Patisiran and Givosiran). In addition, GalNAc (N-acetylgalactosamine) has been
used clinically to direct siRNA to liver hepatocytes. We have identified a lead siRNA that is cross-reactive for
human, NHP, and mouse MCJ. We have also developed proprietary GalNAc vectors and a lead siRNA-GalNAc
formulation (MITO-1041), but that formulation has not yet been tested in NASH models or for the rare occurrence
of polynucleotide liver toxicity. In Phase I, we will test for toxicity and efficacy. Back-up compounds have also
been identified to de-risk the program. Upon success of Phase I, we will apply to the NIH for Phase II funding. In
Phase II, we will carry out a number of IND enabling studies, as suggested by NIDDK. Following the success of
these studies, we will submit an SBIR Phase IIb proposal to manufacture GMP material, carry out the final GLP
tox studies in rat and NHPs, submit an IND, and carry out a first in human Phase I clinical study.Narrative
Non-alcohol steatohepatitis (NASH) is a devastating disease for which there is no FDA approved treatment.
NASH is an advanced stage of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that can lead to cirrhosis (liver failure)
as well as hepatocellular carcinoma. While the frequency of NASH is very high in those with other metabolic
disorders, such as obesity, diabetes, and/or hyperlipidemia (80%), about 15-20% of healthy population also
has developed the first stage of the disease. About 5 million instances of NASH have been diagnosed in the
US with advanced fibrosis and about 1.8 million individuals have progressed to cirrhosis. This is a proposal to
develop the first FDA approved treatment for NASH.",  ,,,,Cynthia  Arbeeny,,(508) 685-7846,carbeeny@mitotherapeutix.com,,  ,

Molecular phenotyping has led to a growing appreciation of neural cell type diversity and function
thereby transforming our understanding of the brain. Beyond first-order classification of cells as glial or neuronal,
excitatory or inhibitory, it is now recognized that there are dozens of molecularly-defined cell types that differ in
their morphology, connectivity, physiology, and gene and protein expression. Detection of protein in fixed tissues
via immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been a major driver of cell type discovery, with a cell’s precise
microenvironment within tissue (e.g. proximity to vasculature and extracellular deposits) providing essential
physiological context. Such data have yielded a rich picture of how cellular topography varies by brain region
and provides a robust backdrop to assess cell type-specific changes that occur in disease states, such as
profound neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Despite the prevalence of IHC, its
application has remained encumbered by the slow rate at which reagents such as IgG antibodies passively
diffuse into tissue. Due to this bottleneck, tissues have traditionally been thinly sliced (≤ 50 µm) to facilitate
uniform staining of features and make quantitative analyses reliable. CLARITY, iDISCO, and related techniques
that optically-clear intact tissues by removing cell membrane lipids have offered a means to perform whole-brain
IHC, as delipidation grants reagents easier access to deep tissue sites. However, labeling time remains a major
bottleneck, with intact samples requiring weeks to months of incubation for labeling to reach the center. If whole
organs could be labeled more quickly and practically it would provide a powerful tool to perform unbiased
molecular phenotyping in mammalian models of development and neurological disorders. To this end LifeCanvas
developed SmartLabel (SL), the world’s first whole-organ active immunostaining device that fully labels an entire
mouse brain in just 24 hrs using proprietary stochastic electrotransport technology. SL additionally employs an
affinity ramp, a method in which antibodies are evenly distributed throughout the tissue before binding to target
proteins to produce labeling that is strikingly uniform in intensity from the sample’s surface to its core. During
Phase I, we broadened SL’s applications by (1) extending SL’s rapid immunolabeling capability for tissues
processed using iDISCO, (2) ensuring compatibility with key morphological, cell type, and neuronal activity
markers such as c-Fos, (3) adapting the technology to work with diverse sample types such as human cerebral
organoids, and (4) developing a prototype next-generation SL that performed simultaneous and cost-effective
cohort-level immunolabeling of multiple organoids or adult mouse brains. Having completed all the Phase I
project goals, we are now poised – in Phase II – to complete the development of the next generation SL, a dual
function clearing and labeling device capable of rapid immunostaining and turnkey batch-processing of a wide
range of neural sample types including tissues of different CNS/PNS origins and of various mammalian species.
Additionally, we will continue in-house research to expand the number of validated antibodies against
neuroscience-related targets by three-fold, and further enable DISCO users to adopt SL in their pipeline for rapid
and uniform immunolabeling. Our Phase II goals are to commercialize the next generation SL, popularize active
immunolabeling and thereby facilitate application of quantitative whole-sample molecular phenotyping analyses
for a broader neuroscience community.",  ,,,,ADAM C HALL,,(413) 387-5487,adamh@lifecanvastech.com,,  ,

Stroke affects over 7.5 million patients in the U.S, with an estimated 795,000 additional cases of stroke
occurring each year. Over 30% of stroke survivors have spasticity, a disorder of muscle tone that can cause
striking impairments in functional movement. Pharmacological, surgical and physical treatments to manage
spasticity have, at best, short-term efficacy and are confounded by side effects. In this NINDS CREATE
Device project, we propose translational activities that will advance through multi-site Phase II clinical trials and
regulatory submission a recently developed neuromodulation device that non-invasively treats spasticity using
a novel approach that combines trans-spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) with simultaneous peripheral
nerve stimulation. The implications of the current project are far-reaching changes in clinical practice for
treating spasticity using an entirely novel approach based on non-invasive neuromodulation. PathMaker
Neurosystems Inc. is a clinical-stage neuromodulation company developing a first-in-class treatment for
treating stroke patients with spasticity. Our objective for this NINDS CREATE Device project is to carry out key
translational activities that will be essential for advancing this technology through multi-site Phase II clinical
trials and regulatory approval as a safe and efficacious new treatment for spasticity. The project consists of 5
Specific Aims: In Specific Aim 1, we will implement a GMP-compliant version of the device (MyoRegulator)
for use in a Phase II pivotal clinical study in stroke. In Specific Aim 2, we will implement a compliant Quality
Management System (QMS). In Specific Aim 3, we will complete preparations for a Phase II clinical study. In
Specific Aim 4, we will complete a multi-site double-blind controlled human clinical study. In Specific Aim 5,
we will submit De Novo 510(k) for regulatory approval for MyoRegulator. These Specific Aims will lay the
essential groundwork allowing our novel, NIH-funded technology to move rapidly through human clinical trials
and to regulatory approval. As our company works to translate the groundbreaking academic studies that have
resulted in a novel approach to the treatment of spasticity, NINDS CREATE Device support will advance this
breakthrough treatment towards the market and enable an entirely new treatment option for stroke patients
with spasticity.",  ,,,,NADER  YAGHOUBI,,(617) 909-4846,ny@riboticsystems.com,,  ,

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) affects 8-33% of the global population. GERD can lead to esophagitis, strictures,
ulcerations and Barrettandapos;s esophagus (BE). Patients with BE have up to an 125-fold increased risk of developing esophageal
adenocarcinoma—a devastating outcome which is fatal in roughly 80-90% of cases. Currently, the gold standard treatment
for GERD remains long-term proton pump inhibitors, i.e. PPI therapy, or laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF).
However, PPI therapy fails to control GERD symptoms in 25%-42% of patients, and the chronic use of PPIs is associated
with serious adverse effects. Moreover,
LNF is technically exacting, and currently fewer than 1% of the eligible GERD
population pursue surgery due to concerns of postoperative complications and surgical failure. Thus, an alternative surgical
treatment is needed to close the “therapy gap”. Re
cently, LINX magnetic sphincter augmentation surgery (MSA) has become
an alternative surgical option to address the therapy gap (FDA-approved, January, 2012; Torax Medical, MN), The LINX
device is a ring of magnets permanently placed laparoscopically around the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). Although the
side-effect profile of MSA is somewhat superior to LNF, unfortunately,
high rates of postoperative dysphagia
are routinely
seen after LINX placement along with low rates of device erosion.
To address these issues and improve GERD therapy, we have developed an entirely new class of GERD treatment: a novel
biodegradable device. Our device is called the Eschara suture collar and consists of a dense, tubular matrix of bioabsorbable
suture material that will create a ring of collagen around the lower esophageal sphincter, in the region of the GEJ. As the
material biodegrades within a matter of days, it loses tensile strength, thus avoiding any dysphagia. Within a matter of
weeks, the suture collar material totally absorbs and, via a foreign body reaction, leaves behind a collar of collagen that
supplies the appropriate amount of LES augmentation to demonstrably improve LES effacement characteristics, increase
yield pressure, decrease compliance at the GEJ, and increase functional LES length, thereby preventing pathologic acid
reflux. We developed the Eschara device in order to provide an ideal GERD solution with the following advantages over
LNF and LINX: 1) Correct GERD pathophysiology, 2) preserve natural physiological swallowing, belching, and vomiting,
minimize dysphagia, 3) cause minimal risk to the vagus nerve, 4) no risk of erosion, 5) MRI, and all imaging, compatible,
6) simple manufacturing, 7) Enable simplified Hiatal Hernia repair, and 8) eliminate the need for continued PPI use.
To ensure adequate performance of the Eschara suture collar prototype, we will 1) fabricate and develop the design; then 2)
test and validate it in an in vivo swine model. Based on the results of initial experiments, we will: 3) Fabricate and develop
the second round of design iteration; 4) perform second swine experiment. This Phase 1 SBIR proposal prepares us for an
SBIR Phase II grant aimed at achieving design freeze, regulatory preparation, and commercialization. Also, we will critically
evaluate our suture model to determine whether the Eschara technology could efficiently meet the needs of the GERD
market and be a successful alternative to current surgical techniques, leading to improved care for GERD patients.PROJECT NARRATIVE
There is currently no ideal minimally invasive surgery for patients with gastroesophageal reflux failing medical
management, and current surgical approaches are either physiologically and anatomically disruptive (Nissen
fundoplication) or require a permanent foreign body implant around the gastroesophageal junction (LINX magnetic
augmentation). In this Phase 1 SBIR program, we will develop and validate a novel biodegradable suture collar device
(Eschara Medical) to be positioned around the gastroesophageal junction, ultimately resulting in uniform collagen
deposition that will augment the lower esophageal sphincter, and favorably affect yield pressure and compliance
dynamics at the gastroesophageal junction. This will provide the GERD therapy community a safe and effective tool to
enhance the GERD treatment armamentarium.",  ,,,,RYAN  BALKO,,(612) 803-8602,ryan.balko@volaremedical.com,,  ,

With this tool in hand, pharmaceutical researchers will be able to target molecular pathways previously inaccessible for drug development against Gene Regulatory Protein (GRP)-regulated cancer, neurological, and other conditions. The beneficial effects of drug-based therapies to treat cancers such as multiple myeloma (MM), small cell lung carcinoma, and neurological cancers will improve health outcomes: In the USA alone, about 1.8 million new cancer cases are diagnosed every year. Millions of people will benefit if any drug targeting the function of GRPs is identified using this technology. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project converts technology from a manual bench application into a high-throughput platform. This project will implement a quantitative proteomics-based drug discovery platform that quantifies the effects of small-molecules on the GRP proteome in a diversity of cell and tissue types. Despite their relevance in health and disease, GRPs have been largely considered undruggable for several reasons, including the lack of knowledge of small-molecule pockets and high degrees of intrinsic protein disorder, which both make biochemical study challenging and full structural characterization almost impossible. This project will tackle this problem by removing the need for GRP biochemical isolation via implementing a methodology where the GRP proteome is studied in situ. This method employs nuclear fractionation followed by GRP isolation and characterization, resulting in a platform that can inform the effects of drug compounds on the chromatin-bound proteome. This project will build the first database that links in a statistically-robust manner compounds to their effects on the genome-bound proteome, with links to laboratory measurements (i.e., high-resolution mass spectrometry). The curated data will include both presence of drug/proteome interactions and false and/or positive discovery rates.

Ulcerative keratitis caused by infectious microbes (bacteria, fungi, amoebae and viruses) represents a major
area of medical concern. It is one of the most important causes of corneal opacifications, which is the second
common cause of legal blindness world-wide after cataracts. In 2010, in the USA alone, 76.5% of the
approximately 930,000 doctor’s office and outpatient clinic and 58,000 emergency department visits related to
ocular distress and emergencies, resulted in antibiotic prescriptions for microbial keratitis. The total annual
financial burden on our healthcare system for keratitis cases was estimated to be $175 million in direct health
care expenditures in 2010 and was also estimated to consume over 250,000 annual hours of clinician time.
Bacterial keratitis manifests as corneal ulcer, corneal edema and/or hypopyon and can cause significant
complications including corneal perforation, corneal thinning, elevated intraocular pressure and progression to
endophthalmitis. This could lead to severe clinical outcomes including partial or complete vision loss,
necessity for penetrating keratoplasty, corneal grafts, enucleation and evisceration. Although topical and
systemic antibiotics are effective in reducing microbial loads in keratitis cases (unless the microbe is resistant
to the antibiotic utilized), the time required to resolve the infection is generally quite lengthy. Furthermore,
antibiotics are typically ineffective in reducing inflammation and evoking regenerative repair of corneal and/or
scleral defects and scarring which may be induced by the infection. In the preceding SBIR Phase I effort,
Lynntech, Inc. in collaboration with the University of Mississippi Medical Center has obtained proof-of-concept
for the potential clinical utility of an innovative, inexpensive and compact device, termed iCAP to effectively
treat microbial keratitis at the point-of-diagnosis. We now propose this follow-on Phase II SBIR effort, where
our specific aims are to (1) optimize and finalize iCAP device design, (2) comprehensively elucidate
mechanisms of action of iCAP and (3) comprehensively demonstrate pre-clinical safety and efficacy of iCAP
using relevant in vivo animal models of microbial keratitis and (4) research FDA requirements to enable IDE
application and human trials in future phases of this effort. The successful completion of these specific aims
should pave the way for FDA clearance and commercial insertion into ophthalmologic practice of affordable
iCAP devices to effectively treat microbial keratitis at the point-of-diagnosis which in turn is likely to sustain
high positive impact for the patient populace suffering from microbial keratitis.",  ,,,,ANJAL C SHARMA,,(979) 764-2200,contract@lynntech.com,,  ,

Sonic Math Fundamentals to improve STEM skills for students with vision impairments.
Research shows that children can, and should, engage in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)learning, even in the earliest years of life. Mathematics is often the underpinning of the other STEM disciplines because itserves as a language for science, engineering, and technology.
The visual nature of mathematics results in students who are blind or have low vision (BLV) performing extraordinarily low
in STEM. Even simple STEM concepts such as addition and subtraction can be challenging for BLV children because
these concepts require understanding of the number line, a spatial concept. Hence, students who are visually impaired are
often denied the opportunity to pursue STEM-related careers because they have not fully developed the pre-requisite skills
that allow them to compete alongside their sighted peers. In turn, society is denied the benefits that a diverse workforce
could bring to all facets of STEM employment.
While Interactive Digital Media (IDM), such as tablet-based math game apps, are commonly and effectively used toimprove STEM for sighted children, they are visual in nature. The learning materials developed for these tools are rarelyaccessible to BLV students. ObjectiveEd’s long-term goal is to develop materials that will allow BLV students to useIDM effectively. In turn this will allow BLV students to have the option to pursue a STEM education path and career,resulting in increased diversity in the STEM fields.
This SBIR project has three aims for Phase 1: Aim 1: Define requirements and develop game specification for early mathskills based on Common Core State Standards (CCSS) by consulting with a variety of STEM-focused teachers, mathcurriculum experts and university researchers specializing in the education of students with visual impairments. Aim 2:Create two prototype skill-building math games for BLV students. The games will be accessible using both tactile andsonic feedback, hence its name: Sonic Math Fundamentals. Students can use the apps in both in-classroom and out-of-classroom settings. Teachers will be able to monitor each student’s progress in mastering skills remotely, using a web-based dashboard. Aim 3: Evaluate the digital game prototype for BLV students’ engagement and increased math skills.Evaluation will involve collecting data through pre- and post-game assessments using a CCSS toolkit, game-playanalytics including correct vs. incorrect scores, and structured interviews of teachers and students.
Study Sample: We will recruit 15 BLV students enrolled pre-kindergarten or kindergarten classes. According to teacherreport, the students will not have in mastered shape identification or the number line concept. In our recruitment we willseek to recruit students from different ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds balancing for gender and level of visual
impairment.
Sonic Math Fundamentals aligns with an education objective of this Funding Opportunity Announcement, as it addressesstudent STEM career choice starting with pre-kindergarten and the research objective, as it develops new educationproducts that will advance STEM-based gaming for an underserved student population.Project Narrative
Students who are blind or have low vision (BLV) perform poorly in math, the underpinning of
STEM, due to the visual nature of many math concepts, including basic concepts like the number
line.
This Phase I project will determine the feasibility of learning these concepts through tablet-based
math games that are accessible through sonic feedback from finger movements, which may be
new for the BLV student, along with tactile raised-dot feedback from finger movements, which
is how a BLV student reads braille.
Mastering visual concepts through non-visual methods will enable BLV students to pursue a STEM
education path and career, resulting in increased diversity in the STEM fields.",  ,,,,MARTY  SCHULTZ,,(786) 200-1191,marty@objectiveed.com,,  ,

A large portion of the CO2 emitted each year in the United States is released from distributed sources, like cars, smaller factories, and farms. Direct capture of CO2 from ambient air is therefore necessary for the eventual reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. However, capturing the CO2 in ambient air presents a great challenge due to the dilute nature of the CO2, requiring different strategies than carbon capture from concentrated CO2 waste streams. We propose a novel process for the capture and containment of CO2 from air into a purified, concentrated CO2 stream that can be redirected for use as a feedstock for a wide variety of applications, including chemical manufacturing and syngas formation. The CO2 is captured in a concentrated KOH solution using a high-surface area contactor to form potassium carbonate. The potassium carbonate is then efficiently electrolyzed in a hydrogen-assisted process that reduces the operating potential, increasing the electrical efficiency of the process while generating concentrated and purified CO2. Water, hydrogen, and KOH are also regenerated as byproducts that can be recycled back into the CO2 capture and electrolysis processes, reducing both overall energy and chemical consumption. This process has the potential for large scale-up, with no environmental limitations and virtually no chemical waste generated.

both cases, exsanguination prior to hospitalization is the primary cause of death for both men and women.
Furthermore, healing following trauma can be complicated by infection, keloid formation, insufficient blood flow,
or conditions such as diabetes and obesity. Clot formation is critical to the cessation of bleeding after trauma
and involves the activation of circulating platelets that hone to the site of injury and aggregate to form a platelet
plug, stemming bleeding. Activated platelets also bind fibrin fibers forming at a site of injury to form a platelet-
fibrin mesh. Platelets then utilize actin-myosin machinery to apply forces to the clot network, contracting and
stabilizing the clot and facilitating its role as a provisional matrix to support subsequent cellular infiltration of the
wound environment. In cases of traumatic injury, exsanguination can cause platelets to become depleted,
impairing their ability to stop bleeding and promote healing. Platelet transfusion is the current standard of care;
however, isolated platelets have a short shelf-life, contributing to major supply chain issues. Additionally,
potential immunologic concerns associated with transfusion of blood products highlights the critical unmet need
to develop platelet alternatives to treat bleeding after trauma. We have recently developed synthetic platelet-like
particles (PLPs) created from highly deformable microparticles coupled to fibrin-targeting motifs that are capable
of honing to injuries through high affinity binding to fibrin forming at the sites of injury. Our initial studies
demonstrate that PLPs are able to recapitulate several functions of native platelets, including clot augmentation
in vitro, decreasing bleeding times and overall blood loss in in vivo rodent models of trauma, and improved
healing responses in vivo following injury. The long-term goal of this project is to develop hemostatic PLPs for
emergency medicine applications to augment clotting and decrease blood loss and associated deaths due to
exsanguination. The objective of this application is to evaluate the long-term stability and safety of PLPs. Our
central hypothesis is that PLPs will have significantly superior shelf-life compared to native platelets while
maintaining a maximum tolerated dose well above their therapeutic dosage, thereby supporting moving this
technology forward into further preclinical development. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Determine PLP
stability and 2) Determine maximum tolerated dose.RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH

In the United States (US), 73% of scientists and engineers are white with less than 2% being African American
(AA) women.1 While AA girls and women comprise 7% of the US population, they are significantly under-
represented in STEM education and professions – with less than 2% of AA women in all STEM occupations.
Research suggests that STEM promotion interventions for AA girls should occur during preschool/early-primary
school, when the foundational “building blocks” of self-efficacy are first developed (e.g., mastery experiences,
social modeling). For this Phase I SBIR project, we propose Kukua - an innovative, fun, and engaging, early
childhood STEM as a promotion intervention program for African American girls (4–8 years-old). Kukua, meaning
“grow” or “grow up” in Swahili, will be a culturally-relevant smart doll with corresponding daily interactive digital
media, via videos, coupled with a primary caregiver app for engagement in STEM activities. Kukua will increase
STEM skills development and interest from observational, play-based learning, and role modeling.21 Additionally,
Kukua will challenge false assumptions about AA girls’ STEM abilities. Kukua will be designed and developed
by Benten Technologies, led by Principal Investigator (PI) Tony Ma of Benten Technologies in collaboration with
Dr. Natalie S. King (Co-I) of Georgia State University, Katie Chang (Co-I) of Benten Technologies, and Dr.
Krystyna Isaacs (Project Manager) of Benten Technologies. The specific aims of this Phase I project are: 1)
Develop a prototype of Kukua, including caregiver app and ten 15-minute interactive videos for the first 2-weeks
of a 12-week program, using formative research with AA girls (4-8 years old) and primary caregivers; and 2)
Conduct a 2-week pilot testing of Kukua with 20 AA girls (4-8 years old) and their primary caregiver to assess its
feasibility (usability, acceptance, and engagement).
Impact: In the short-term, this study will demonstrate the feasibility of the development and implementation of
a play and observational learning-based intervention utilizing a smart doll alongside other interactive digital
media that includes an interactive mobile application featuring interactive videos for promoting STEM interest
and skills development among African American girls. In the long-term, African American girls will continue to
engage in STEM education after elementary school, have a greater sense of belonging in STEM, and
demonstrate increased confidence and interest in STEM. For Phase II, we plan to complete the development
of the 12-week program and test the effects of Kukua on increasing STEM knowledge, interest, and identity
among African American girls, and ultimately increase African American girls’ and women’s representation in
STEM education and professions.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Benten Technologies will develop an innovative platform entitled Kukua to address complex challenges of
developing STEM identity and promoting interest in STEM education and careers among African American

These modules will be used to create an 8-channel transceiver (TRX) board that can mate natively with the Xilinx RFSoC-based ZCU111 board. The resulting system represents an 8-channel 140 GHz SDR that can then be used for systems-level experiments in the domains of communications and sensing. The Pi-Radio device drivers and reference examples will be ported over to the 140 GHz system. Twelve such 8-channel TRX boards will be provided to DARPA for distribution. In the subsequent Option period, four units each of the 8-channel TX and RX modules (left over from the Base period) will be tiled together to create a single 32-channel TRX board. This will be mated with a specially designed baseband subsystem in order to create a 32-channel fully-digital SDR. The architecture has been specifically designed to be scalable, such that multiple such units can be combined together to create SDRs having an arbitrary number of channels (in multiples of 32). After testing, this 32-channel TRX board will also be given to DARPA for distribution.",Timothy N Hancock,program manager,(571) 218-4529,timothy.hancock@darpa.mil,Aditya  Dhananjay,,(212) 300-3350,aditya.dhananjay@pi-rad.io,,  ,

Cancer remains the second leading cause of deaths in the U.S. Encouragingly, recent improvements in early
diagnosis and treatment has led to significant increases in the survival rate of cancer patients. As cancer
becomes a chronic but manageable disease for thousands of survivors, the long-term physical and psychological
side effects of treatment protocols is becoming more apparent, as is the impact of these issues on disease-free
or overall survival. As a result of this changing landscape, survivorship care programs and approaches that
incorporate non-pharmacological lifestyle and mind-body interventions are becoming increasingly critical
components of the patient treatment pathway. In this regard, integrative approaches such as yogic breathing
(YB), a collection of techniques to voluntarily regulate breathing, have emerged as an effective complementary
therapy for cancer patients. YB is well-established to induce strong relaxation responses via vagal and
parasympathetic stimulation. YB is easy to practice using virtual tools such as mobile apps especially during the
current scenario of COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing. In this application, PranaScience seeks to
develop a novel group video app for YB that is optimized for home-based delivery of a proscribed YB program
that is maximally effective in promoting peer support, and relieving symptomatic conditions associated with
cancer treatment and survivorship. This intervention is based on compelling preliminary data generated by the
PI of this proposal demonstrating that specific YB exercises induce alterations in the levels of proteins associated
with tumor suppression, immune regulation, neuromodulation, and stress response/ inflammation, as well as
pilot studies performed in cancer survivors and other patient/general populations indicating that participants are
interested in a YB intervention and perceive improvements in well-being after YB sessions. In this Phase I STTR,
PranaScience (1) has built a first production version of a culturally neutral group video YB app and (2) partners
with the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) to pilot test the YB app in breast cancer survivors to
evaluate adherence, feasibility, and acceptability of the app to support symptom management. App usage data
is collected and used to evaluate adherence to the program, and acceptability for symptom management will be
evaluated using a series of defined biobehavioral measures at baseline and following a 12-week implementation
period. Exploratory salivary and fingernail biomarker analysis focused on tumor suppressors, inflammatory
cytokines, proteome level alterations, and stress hormones will be performed at baseline and at week 12.
Structured, focus group interviews of study participants will be used to assess technology perception/ program
feasibility and will inform future design optimizations. Information from the I-Corps supplemental work will be
used to refine app in preparation for large-scale evaluation in Phase II, and for commercialization purposes
through customer discovery interviews.NARRATIVE
Cancer survivorship is associated with many long-term chronic health issues that arise as a result of cancer
treatment protocols. Non-pharmacological lifestyle and mind-body interventions have been shown to be
effective and critical components of a total-health strategy for cancer survivors. PranaScience Institute has
developed a novel group video app for home-based delivery of a Yogic Breathing intervention and would like to
study its marketability and commercialization potential through this I-Corps supplemental funding.",  ,,,,SUNDARAVADIVEL  BALASUBRAMANIAN,,(843) 876-2296,balasubr@musc.edu,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,  ,

and glycans needed to support and grow RandD related to viral glycobiology at large scale and reasonable
prices. This technology will support researchers studying viral pathology, analyses of viral binding and
interactions with hosts, studies to develop novel antiviral therapeutics and vaccines, and others.Glycobiology is important in a number of ways for viral research. Viral surface proteins are often heavily
glycosylated to both avoid recognition by the host cell and, in some cases, interact with host receptors. For
example, the spike protein glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is usually the extension of an N-linked core
pentasaccharide compound, composed of a stem of chitobiose followed by mannoses to form two antennary
complexes. Understanding glycosylation of viral spike proteins and their potential epitope masking is of
fundamental importance for vaccine research. Receptors recognized by many viruses are glycosylated
proteins as well. SARS-CoV-2 and others uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, (ACE2) as its receptor, and
other b-coronaviruses, utilize sialic acid residues on cellular glycoproteins as receptors.Glycans are currently being studied as vaccines against viruses (Dengue, Hepatitis C), parasites
(Plasmodium) and fungi (Candida). Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) have been shown to reduce the
possibility of infections due to interference with adhesion of pathogenic bacteria and potentially viruses.
Galectins have been shown have pro- or anti-viral properties and play important role in innate immunity.
Finally, some galectin inhibitors may block HIV infection of T cells. Oligosaccharides are currently isolated
from nature or synthesized at extremely low yield via a complex set of protection and deprotection steps.
Oligosaccharides and the activated sugar building blocks needed to build them enzymatically are needed in
larger quantities to support and spawn additional research in this important field.In the Feasibility study we successfully demonstrated the development of a set of novel enzymes to
produce a wide range of key activated sugar building blocks required to build important oligosaccharides. We
then demonstrated the use of these activated sugars to extend model oligosaccharide chains. In the Phase II
work, we will increase the scale of production of all of these activated sugars, extend the system to produce
additional activated sugars needed, and make a number of key oligosaccharides important to viral biology
research. Products made during the Phase II Research will be distributed to investigators and in Phase III
products will be commercialized as part of our research reagent catalog or by carrying out custom synthesis of
oligosaccharides for third parties.",  ,,,,LEILA  AMINOVA,,(217) 721-3122,laminova@zuchem.com,,  ,

The proposed platforms allow drug testing under specific physiological conditions to investigate how certain drugs or drug combinations might affect specific cells. Currently available platforms are extremely complex and rely on costly, labor-intensive, time-consuming, and low-throughput fabrication methods, hampering the translation potential of such systems into a commercial setting. Moreover, standardization and analytic validation of such platforms are needed for reproducible and reliable sample testing, facilitating the process of regulatory approval. This project will significantly help standardize and validate a high-throughput platform for deployment at scale. This project will help reduce operational costs for preclinical drug discovery/screening studies and lower the drug failure rate, as patient-specific testing will be possible. This Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project proposes to develop a standardized and validated microfluidic platform integrated with human endothelial cells for drug discovery/screening purposes. Since the traditional in vivo and in vitro techniques that are employed in the preclinical stage of drug development are extremely costly, labor intensive, time-consuming, and can still lead to high failure rates, there is an urgent need for physiologically relevant in vitro assays for preclinical assessment of new drug candidates, particularly in the cardiovascular disease and blood disorders spaces. Microfluidic platforms allow for precise control of gas and flow conditions at a size scale equivalent to that of human microvasculature and offer physiologically relevant vascularized environments for in vitro testing. To ensure accuracy, reliability, and robustness of the assay, research objectives include a comprehensive and systematic approach to standardize the culture and activation of endothelial cells under physiologic flow conditions. Furthermore, standardized both short-term and long-term activation of endothelial cells via disease specific activators (e.g., heme, TNF-α, etc.) will be established to better mimic in vivo conditions.

autonomic function in over 17,000 individuals in the US every year. Currently, there are no FDA approved
therapies to treat acute SCI which causes almost all cases to become chronic and last a lifetime. The annual
economic loss due to SCI in the US is approximately $8.0B, and lifetime costs per patient can exceed $5.0M
depending on the level on the injury. VersaPeutics is a small business that is developing VERSAMAB-101, a
novel monoclonal antibody therapy for acute SCI. A commercial scale manufacturing process for the antibody
has been developed, and the preclinical safety studies done so far have indicated that the antibody is well
tolerated in rodents and non-human primates. The goal of this project is to continue the preclinical development
of VERSAMAB-101 through two studies requested by the FDA. (1) A possible method of delivering the antibody
to the site of injury is via one of the implanted intrathecal infusion devices that are currently approved for
delivering pain medications (aka “pain pumps”). In order for one of these devices to be useful in the clinic,
VERSAMAB-101 must be stable inside the device for the duration that it will be in use. VersaPeutics will conduct
a study to determine the stability of VERSAMAB-101 while inside an intrathecal infusion device during a
simulated clinical administration. To our knowledge, no study on the stability of any antibody in any intrathecal
infusion device has ever been made public. VersaPeutics will publish the results of this study in a scientific
journal for the benefit of the public and scientific community. (2) Prior to any first-in-human studies, the FDA and
international guidance state that monoclonal antibody binding to human tissue should be tested in order to help
determine any sites of unintended or unpredicted binding. These studies are known as tissue cross-reactivity
(TCR) studies and are typically done using good laboratory practices (GLP). We will perform a GLP TCR study
for VERSAMAB-101 and examine antibody binding to the FDA recommended set of tissues from 37 different
human organs collected from 3 unrelated individuals. The results of this study will be included in any future
requests to the FDA or other regulatory agencies for permission to use VERSAMAB-101 in clinical trials. (Future
Phase II Project) The future Phase II portion of this project will continue the preclinical development of
VERSAMAB-101 through other studies that are necessary to complete prior to filing an Investigational New Drug
application with the FDA.NARRATIVEThe goal of this project is to develop a monoclonal antibody therapy for acute spinal cord injury, a
condition for which no FDA approved pharmaceutical therapies exist. If successful, this monoclonal antibody

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer are the third and sixth most
common causes of death worldwide. One major challenge is that there are no effective screening
methods capable of early detection of these diseases and when these diseases are finally
detected, they are often at advanced stages for which few effective treatment strategies exist. In
the case of lung cancer, more than half of people die within the year of diagnosis.
Darkfield (scattering-based) x-ray contrast has been recently demonstrated to provide exciting
capabilities for early detection of lung pathologies, including cancer and COPD at doses
comparable to conventional chest radiography. This contrast mechanism differs significantly
from current approaches, which use the absorption of x-rays for contrast rather than the
scattering of x-rays. Accessing information provided by this contrast mechanism requires an
emerging grating-based x-ray technique called Talbot-Lau interferometry, which uses three sets
of gratings (source, phase, and detector) to achieve contrast. However, a critical bottleneck for
using this technique at the high x-ray energies (~60 keV) required for imaging through a human
chest is a source grating with the aspect ratios required cannot be fabricated.
We propose to develop a lung darkfield imaging prototype using a major x-ray source innovation
that removes the need for the x-ray source grating to enable Talbot-Lau interferometry at high
x-ray energies. The system will critically enable demonstrations of the clinical potential of
darkfield radiography for early detection of lung pathologies.
The proposed Phase I 6-month project is a proof-of-principle of a grating-less Talbot-Lau
breadboard set-up on a phantom. The proposed Phase II 24-month project is to develop a
complete prototype system and experimentally verify its performance.",  ,,,,DAVID  VINE,,(773) 704-9102,dvine@sigray.com,,  ,

Millions of people in the US misuse opioids each year, leading to thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in
total economic burden. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are highly efficacious, but only a fraction of
people with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) access MOUD, and further treatment non-adherence is common and is
associated with poor outcomes. This application will extend the scope of our parent R42 Opioid Addiction
Recovery Support with Contingency Management (OARS+CM) study assessing the impact of OARS+CM
technology on MOUD treatment initiation and adherence by expanding enrollment sites to include additional EDs
and inpatient psychiatric and detox facilities to reach the sample size needed to adequately analyze the data.
Expansion is necessary as volume at the current enrollment sites are lower than predicted. In the parent grant,
the project enhanced the Opioid Addiction Recovery Support (OARS) application by adding an evidence-based
reward, contingency management (CM) function. CM interventions systematically reward (reinforce) specific
behaviors like treatment initiation and adherence with therapy attendance and drug-free urine tests and are
highly efficacious. An OARS solution enhanced with a CM component (OARS+CM) that allows for the automatic
calculation, delivery, and redemption of rewards contingent on objective evidence of treatment behaviors may
be key to improving MOUD initiation and adherence. After Phase 1 of the parent grant, the existing OARS
clinician portal and patient mobile application was modified to accommodate entry into the software system from
an acute care setting and to automatically manage and deliver rewards to create OARS+CM using patient-
centered design principles. Usability sessions with OUD patients and other key stakeholders informed design.
Primary usability outcomes were examined, and the program iteratively updated. Upon meeting milestones, there
was proof-of-concept pilot of usability, acceptability, and effects on initial behavior targets with 10 patients.
Currently in Phase 2, an RCT is in progress, in which acute care OUD patients appropriate for outpatient MOUD
(N = 102) are recruited and allocated to one of two study conditions: 1) treatment as usual (TAU), comprised of
screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment by a trained clinician with MyMAT, an attentional control
mobile application, and 2) OARS+CM. The active intervention window for the two intervention groups is 12
weeks. Participants are onboarded prior to discharge from acute care settings (i.e., ED, inpatient medical care,
acute psychiatric and detox facilities). In the outpatient MOUD setting, data on treatment adherence and opioid
use will be captured from clinical records for six months. Telephone follow-up assessments and vital statics
registry reviews will be at month 1, month 3 (end-of-study intervention period), and month 6. Primary MOUD
treatment initiation outcomes will be scheduling and completing the MOUD intake. Primary MOUD treatment
outcomes will be sustained abstinence at Month 6 and longest duration of abstinence. Analysis will examine data
on cost avoidance and cost savings through reduced acute care visits between study conditions.",  ,,,,EDWIN D BOUDREAUX,,(508) 334-3817,edwin.boudreaux@umassmed.edu,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,  ,

selectively reducing sodium channel expression
Effective treatment of cancer pain is a large unmet medical need, as opioids, the current standard of care lack
efficacy and cause addiction. For end-of-life cancer patients and estrogen receptor- positive breast cancer
patients with long life expectancy, more effective therapeutic approaches for pain are needed. Antisense
oligonucleotides (ASOs) bind to and induce degradation of RNA transcripts with specific sequences, enabling
selective protein knockdown (KD) with long duration of action (weeks or months), to deliver long-term relief.
ASOs can also be used in combination, to reduce the expression of multiple proteins for increased efficacy. As
a modality, ASOs have been successfully applied in the clinic to treat severe neurological disease.
We target the voltage gated sodium channels (Navs) selectively expressed in dorsal root ganglion neurons
(Nav1.7, Nav1.8 and Nav1.9), which are implicated in pain transmission and specifically in cancer pain.
Reduction of channel expression aims to overcome the limitations of small molecule state-dependent channel
blockers, if the channel should be blocked in a state-independent manner for efficacy. Preliminary results with
our designed ASOs show rt70% mRNA KD for several Navs in rat dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons (DRGs).
We apply a novel platform to design ASOs for specific knockdown of Nav channels. For pain targets and
indications, QuellTx also has an exclusive worldwide license to breakthrough technology: (i) An in vitro cellular
model for cancer pain (developed through SBIR funding by NCI), where primary DRG neurons are bathed in a
physiologically-relevant mixture of inflammatory mediators secreted by tumors, or ‘cancer-SPARC’. The SPARC-
treated neurons become hyperexcitable, mimicking the cellular pain response. (ii) An all optical electrophysiology
high throughput readout for neuronal excitability (Optopatch), allowing recordings from 100s of individual neurons
in parallel with high temporal resolution. This platform enables us to determine the impact of modulating
expression of Nav1.7, 1.8 and 1.9, alone or in combination, on the pain-in-a-dish phenotype.
In Phase I we propose to leverage our ASO design capabilities, combined with the breakthrough technology to:
(a) identify ASOs for selective modulation of expression of Nav channel pain targets and (b) determine the
combination of ASOs and %mRNA knock down for maximal phenotypic effect in vitro. We will select ASOs that
efficiently knockdown Nav channels and reverse the pain phenotype induced by cancer-SPARC. In Phase II we
will determine the PK/PD (%mRNA KD) in rats, and the % mRNA KD needed for efficacy in a rat model of cancer
pain, while optimizing human cross-reacting with cynmolgous monkey (cyno) ASOs for efficacy in human DRG
neuronal models of pain. Our ultimate goal is to advance optimized ASOs to IND enabling toxicity studies in rat
and cynos, leading to a therapeutic to treat cancer pain in patients.",  ,,,,HONGKANG  ZHANG,,(410) 497-2498,hongkang.zhang@quelltx.com,,  ,

We are developing an improved method to treat patients with malignant pleural effusions (MPE), a serious
condition that occurs in 175,000 patients in the US each year, affecting between 7 to 15% of all cancer
patients. MPE results in an excessive accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity, frequently leaving the patient
to suffer from shortness of breath and overall poor quality of life. Management of MPE is palliative and the
main problem with the current techniques such as pleurodesis is its clinical failure rate due to the inefficient
and non-uniform distribution of the sclerosing agent. Currently, there is no standardization or consensus
within the medical community on the optimal delivery technique for a sclerosing agent because of the
tradeoffs and variability in patient satisfaction, efficacy, costs, and complexities. Our focus is on the
development of an improved clinical approach to administering a sclerosing agent, which will overcome the
problems with standard of care.
In Phase I feasibility studies, we developed and evaluated several foam formulations and have selected a
lead candidate. We fully characterized the lead, demonstrating its desired adhesiveness, gelation and
reverse thermo-sensitive properties as well as its efficacy in an animal model. These results enabled us to
optimize the lead formulation and in parallel select the final design of our proprietary delivery system with
important end user input during our active Phase II project. The fully functional prototype will be evaluated for
safety and efficacy during biocompatibility studies conducted under GLP conditions, in order to prepare a
data package for an IND application to the Food and Drug Administration. Once successfully completed,
these Phase II results will prepare us to initiate clinical trials where we will test the combination product in

The proposed project will develop a device that records brain and muscle signals (electroencephalography and
electromyography, EEG/EMG) from behaving rodents without the cumbersome, expensive, and maintenance-
intensive wires or batteries that hinder the usefulness of existing commercially available systems. By delivering
both power and data wirelessly, and entirely eliminating all external implants on the animal, our technology will
extend brain recording capabilities to sensitive behaviors, such as sleep-wake behavior or social interaction, that
are easily disrupted by external tethers, and will enable long-term recordings and recordings from animals

impact, which leads to secondary injury cascades of degenerative cellular and molecular events. The
secondary injury spreads along the spinal cord over time, which adds new levels of disability and has
devastating effects. Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation at the impact site is an important
component of these secondary injury cascades. Neupron™ is patented polymeric nanoparticle composition
encapsulating antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase and catalase, with high catalytic activity to
neutralize ROS. The preliminary data demonstrated efficacy of Neupron following intravenous injection at 3 hrs
after the injury in a rat contusion model of SCI. The treatment neutralized the excess ROS formed after the
injury, significantly inhibited the progression of secondary injury, and regained locomotive functions.
AxoNeural Therapeutics, Inc., is a new spin off company of Cleveland Clinic Innovation. The goal is to develop
Neupron as an early therapeutic intervention to protect the spinal cord from secondary injury and promote
regeneration. Such an effective early intervention can minimize severity of the post-injury disability and
enhances the prospects of achieving better neurological and functional recovery. Through the R41 STTR
Phase I grant, the main objective is to undertake critical formulation development of Neupron. The successful
outcome of Phase-I would set the stage for Phase-II application to advance Neupron to the IND stage and
ultimately to clinical development. Since there are ~17,000 cases of SCI per year in the US, Neupron will be
considered as an orphan drug. Our aims for this proposal are:
Aim 1: Establish parameters for pilot-scale production of Neupron: a) Establish a scale-up process
that is reproducible for production of Neupron under GLP conditions and b) Evaluate Neupron for initial
assessment of its biocompatibility in rat SCI model. Milestones: At least three consecutive production batches
showing less than 5% variation in physical and biological (catalytic) characteristics of Neupron and without any
toxicity concern.Aim 2: Characterize Neupron produced under cGMP conditions: Nebraska Nanomedicine Production
Plant is a contract laboratory with cGMP nanoparticle production capacity. Neupron prepared under cGMP
condition will be tested for physical and biological properties to ensure successful transfer of the protocol
developed under GLP conditions. Neupron will be evaluated for bioburden and endotoxin levels. Milestones:
Neupron meets the FDA guidelines for parenteral products (2l CFR parts 210 and 211). Arrange Pre-IND
meeting with the FDA.Public Relevance: The project goal is to develop Neupron™, a neuroprotective agent as an early therapeutic
intervention to protect the injured spinal cord from progressive degeneration, promote regeneration, and regain

While the FDA and the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay initiative (CiPA) are focused primarily on
predicting proarrhythmic effects, drug attrition due to cardiomyopathy, or primary cardiac cytotoxicity, may be
even more prevalent, is typically currently only carried out via animal studies, and limits dosage for many
cancer chemotherapeutics. Due to improving cancer survival, it is increasing common for more cancer
survivors of some cancer types to die of cardiac diseases due to cancer treatment side effects than cancer
recurrence. Cardiac contractions are initiated by electrical depolarizations (action potentials, APs) that
propagate through the heart and initiate calcium (Ca2+) transients that activate the contractile apparatus.
Importantly, dysregulation of Ca2+ can trigger inappropriate early-after- and delayed-after- depolarizations
(EADs and DADs) that initiate arrhythmias, inhibit mitochondrial function, and pathologically alter expression of
contractile proteins. Chemotherapy and other drugs can also directly impair mitochondrial function, which is
primarily thought to cause cytotoxicity, but can also cause arrhythmias. Cardiomyocytes are also
heterogeneous in their voltage, calcium, and contractile functions, and in their responses to therapeutic
candidates. Thus, it is highly desirable to simultaneously measure AP, Ca2+ and contractile function on a cell-
by-cell basis, in human cardiomyocytes, but this is not possible with current test methods. To address this
unmet need we propose to develop a high throughput (robotic) Kinetic Image Cytometry that simultaneously
quantifes voltage, calcium, and contractile motion in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent
stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). The hiPSC-CMs will be labeled with fluorescent indicators of calcium and voltage,
and the cells imaged via high-speed automated microscopy during contractile activity. The use of hiPSC-CMs
will enable “clinical trials” in a dish, in which test compounds are tested across cells representing several
donors. Phase I of this Fast-Track STTR project will develop the basic protocol and perform a proof-of-concept
screen of 30 test compounds on hiPSC-CMs representing 5 donors. In Phase II, a large validation study (~350
compounds, 7-concentration dose-response, 30 min and 72 hr exposures) will be performed. Artificial
intelligence will be utilized to optimize the sensitivity and specificity of the assay by detecting complex
arrhythmia waveforms. This assay represents a human-based preclinical model that will be less expensive
and more predictive for cardiotoxicity testing than animal models and will be marketed to the pharmaceutical
industry for contract research.FDA guidelines stipulate that all new drugs be tested for dangerous side-effects on the heart as part of
preclinical research; however, the current tests are poorly predictive of both dangerous and safe drugs leading
to unwarranted attrition and dangerous drugs reaching clinic. Human cardiomyocytes derived from donor
tissue (iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes) are widely considered to hold great promise for clinical trial in a dish
studies of drug cardiotoxicity. This STTR proposal is to commercialize a high throughput platform to accurately
identify drug candidates that have cardiac side effects, in particular adding the ability to detect the type of
primary heart cell damage common with anti-cancer drugs in a fully automated (high throughput) robotic assay
for the first time, to improve the efficiency of preclinical research and the safety of human clinical trials, which
will also likely have the added benefit of reducing animal research.",  ,,,,JEFFREY H PRICE,,(858) 461-6861,jhprice10@yahoo.com,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,  ,

Maternal use and addiction to opioids has resulted in an unprecedented rise in drug withdrawal complications in
newborns, known as neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS), also referred to as neonatal abstinence
syndrome (NAS). Between 2004 and 2016, NOWS admissions increased more than fourfold, with an average
hospital stay nearly 3.2 times longer (15.9 hospital days compared with 4.98) than for a non-NOWS patient
resulting in a surge in annual costs to almost $573 million with 83% attributed to state Medicaid programs
(Strahan, 2019). While there is no accepted standard for treating NAS, non-pharmacological bundles are
recommended as an initial course of treatment, moving to pharmacological care when required. Unfortunately,
non-pharmacological care (swaddling, rocking, frequent feedings, and skin contact) requires significant use of
human resources (Theilking, 2017). To reduce the increasing burden on limited resources, the evidence
emerges that hospitals are trying to adapt baby products for consumers that were neither intended nor tested for
use in NAS infants as part of their non-pharmacological bundle. The objective of this application is to establish
the safety, and efficacy of our hospital bassinet pad with stochastic vibrotactile stimulation (SVS) technology as
an adjunctive, non-pharmacological treatment to improve the care of infants with NOWS. In Phase I, we
demonstrated technical feasibility, replicating the clinically critical stimulation of an investigational device
reported to significantly reduce hyperirritability and pathophysiological instabilities without altering sleep states
in NOW infants at a cost below $250/unit. We demonstrated the commercial feasibility of introducing the device
to 51 healthcare professionals, with over 70% indicating they would use the device as an adjunct to or replace
non-pharmacological bundles. During this project, the FDA rejected Prapela’s application for clearance of the
SVS hospital bassinet pad with primary concerns of equivalence between a prototype pad used in the clinical
study versus the commercial pad and the non-clinical safety of the surface fabric cover material relative to
biocompatibility, cleaning and disinfection. To overcome the FDA’s non-clinical safety concerns, we will develop
a new pad cover with a new surface fabric material and then pass FDA requirements for biocompatibility,
cleaning, and disinfection. To address the FDA concerns of equivalence between the prototype pad and the new
commercial pad we will complete in-house vibration studies indicating equivalent performance. The successful
completion of the project will provide data for use in a new submission to the FDA for clearance to commercialize
our low-cost, non-pharmacological device to improve the clinical course of newborns with NOWS.",  ,,,,JOHN P KONSIN,,(978) 760-4988,johnkonsin@prapela.com,,  ,

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a common neuropathological finding among older adults and is
characterized by amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits in blood vessel walls of the brain. CAA is a major cause of
spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and is an important contributor to age related cognitive decline.
Diagnosis is often missed by physicians as the presenting symptoms are similar to a stroke and can be further
complicated as CAA is found in over 80% of Alzheimer's disease patients. Standard diagnosis of probable CAA
involves expensive imaging techniques and an invasive brain biopsy. The only definitive way to diagnose CAA
is through post-mortem analysis. An antemortem diagnostic is needed that can reliably identify CAA at the early,
asymptomatic stages, enabling a correct diagnosis to avoid medications contraindicated in the disease, which
can increase the individual's stroke risk. Furthermore, a useful and affordable outcome marker is needed for
clinical trials focused on therapies for CAA that could stop or reverse the progression of the disease. Amydis
aims to address these unmet needs by identifying A in the eye, as a window to the brain, for early detection of
CAA. Amydis is meeting this need with the development of a novel retinal diagnostic probe. Our novel retinal
diagnostic probe, AMDX-2011P, has fluorescent properties amenable for use with standard retinal imaging
equipment found in the ophthalmologists' office and fluoresces at a wavelength suitable for use with conventional
instruments, it penetrates the retina when administered systemically at significant concentrations, is non-toxic in
preclinical animal models, and has crystalline properties that allow for consistent large-scale manufacturing. In
this proposal, Amydis will manufacture AMDX-2011P under GMP guidelines, formulate AMDX-2011P for i.v.
delivery, test stability, and then undertake a phase 1 clinical trial with single ascending doses in healthy subjects
(N=24) and then test the optimal dose in a small cohort of CAA patients (N=5). Completion of these aims will
advance the development of our in vivo ocular diagnostic test, getting us one step closer to our mission of
providing an antemortem, simple, and affordable CAA diagnostic.",  ,,,,STELLA  SARRAF,,(310) 926-9930,stella@amydis.com,,  ,

Current practices that test a product’s effects on humans consist of lengthy, expensive, and harmful animal studies. Given the cost, many animal toxicity screenings often happen in later product development stages – at which point millions of development dollars have already been spent. Major financial losses follow unfavorable screening results. Specifically, this technology will be developed with the intention to not only save millions of dollars downstream, but also maintain animal welfare and ethics in the product development process across industries. Compared to the current market offerings by others, this novel cell toxicity assay is intuitive and easy to manage with respect to time and the number of samples, while providing a rapid, accurate assessment. The global toxicology testing market is projected to reach $14.4 billion by 2025. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at developing a novel, scalable in vitro toxicity assay that leverages a cellular-electrode interface bioprinting technology. Toxicological testing occurs toward the end of product development of a drug or consumer product after millions of dollars have already been poured into R&D. These in vivo screens are expensive, harmful to animals, and have the potential to kill products after years of pre-market development. Bioprinting has emerged as a promising new approach for biofabricating models and systems for in vitro toxicology screening in an attempt to address the ethical and financial burden aforementioned. Yet, despite revolutionary potential, traditional bioprinting has technical and commercial drawbacks (e.g. cell damage, low throughput, high cost, inflexible). This proposal is designed to address those drawbacks by developing 1) a novel method to biofabricate tissues using an innovative bioprinting technique and 2) an integration of electrode sensors to quantitatively measure cell health and viability via electrical signal output correlations. Experimental success of tissue fabrication and electrode-cellular measurements will be determined by greater than 80% of cellular viability following novel bioprinting method and a correlation value of r> 0.6 between electrical impedance readings and canonical molecular toxicity analyses.

Cell secretions are fundamental to biological processes, biotechnology, and cell therapies, however, approaches
to rapidly separate out viable cell populations based on secretions are not widely accessible. The ability to rapidly
sort cells (e.g. B cells, CHO cells) based on a quantitative secretion phenotype can accelerate the discovery and
production of therapeutic or diagnostic antibodies. Further, the function of many cell therapy products are best
defined by the type and quantity of secreted proteins, such as cytokines. Emphasizing the need, several
microfluidic platforms have been developed to perform sorting of secreting cells, focusing on cells that produce
antibodies. However, these systems require specialized expertise or commercial equipment that is not widely
available and are limited in throughput. Based on market research suggesting a need for functional selection
approaches to mitigate the genetic and epigenetic drift in clonal producer cell lines, this proposal aims to support
a new program focused on engineering Partillion’s hydrogel nanovial platform as a reagent-based solution to
separate and maintain in culture enriched populations of highly secreting producer cell (e.g. CHO) sub-clones
using magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS). Our nanovial technology is based on microscale crescent-shaped
hydrogel particles which capture cells, are functionalized to capture secretions, and template the formation of
millions of uniform drops in parallel, preventing the loss and cross-talk of secretions. This workflow only requires
simple pipetting and centrifugation steps. Nanovials with captured secretions and associated cells can then be
labeled with magnetic nanoparticles, conjugated to antibodies specific to secretions of interest, and sorted using
MACS based on the quantity of secretion. We will engineer our nanovial product and develop a workflow to work
robustly with MACS, enabling our customers to sort through andgt; 10 million cells per work day, at least two orders
of magnitude higher than competing technologies on the market, to enrich key productive sub-populations.
Specific Aim (1) focuses on developing workflows for compatibility with magnetic activated cell sorting to ensure
ease of adoption by a wider customer base and enable selection of significantly more cells. Specific Aim (2) will
investigate the potential to magnetically sort based on a combination of secretion and growth and tune the
selection threshold to yield improved cell line productivity. Following the successful completion of our aims we
will have laid a strong foundation for a new reagent product for CHO and other producer cell sorting based on
secretion that is compatible with widely available MACS systems. Ultimately, this can enable more cost-effective
and rapid production of recombinant products such as monoclonal antibody therapies, vaccines, and diagnostic
affinity reagents.NARRATIVE
We will develop nanovials, nanoliter scale vessels that can be used to sort cells based on secreted products
using simple and widely available magnetic sorting technologies. These new reagents promise to reduce the
cost and increase the speed for manufacturing of biological products critical for new therapies, vaccines and
diagnostic tests.",  ,,,,JOSEPH  DERUTTE,,(707) 529-3034,jderutte@partillion.com,,  ,

The basic bolt-tightening method utilizing a torque-wrench has remained largely unchanged since the introduction of the modern fastener in the 1800s. This results in a preload variation of up to 30% in a multi-bolt joint. New methods, including preload sensing, reduce this variation down to 15% albeit at a high cost. High preload variation leads to inefficient joints, bolt loosening, bolt rupture, and leakage problems over the joint’s lifetime. The proposed innovation can potentially reduce this variation down to 5%, a significant improvement. Additionally, it allows multi-bolt joint tightening in just two passes compared to the current method of four passes which saves time and labor. Successful implementation of the proposed technology will be beneficial in reducing the cost of energy, in particular, offshore wind which is poised for rapid growth in the US. Additionally, it will help prevent hazardous leakage of joints in the nuclear, petrochemical, and oil and gas industries and prevent vibration loosening of joints in the transportation, infrastructure, and heavy machinery industries. The proposed technology combines existing, widely used technologies, such as a torque-wrench and ultrasonic bolt tension measurement, with a unique and proprietary computer algorithm. The proposed innovation offers precise control of bolt tensioning, which is essential for the reliability of multi-bolt flange joints. The fundamental concept is already proven through high-fidelity simulations. In Phase I research, simulation studies will continue on more realistic multi-bolt joints to further validate the algorithm. The primary goal of Phase I research is the experimental validation and optimization of the proposed algorithm. Extensive testing will be conducted on a scaled-down flange joint with the help of ultrasonic preload sensors.

Platelet Transfusion Refractoriness (PTR) or the failure to achieve the desired level of blood platelets after
platelet transfusion, hampers the management of bleeding episodes in thrombocytopenic patients. PTR
condition is associated with a high risk of severe bleeding complications and reduced survival rate, longer
hospital stays and higher hospital costs. Existing management strategies are based on the transfusion of
leukodepleted products, HLA-matched platelets, or cross-matched platelets which are obtained after lengthy
and expensive procedures. Alternatives consisting of thrombopoietin mimetics, or recombinant factor XIII
have not shown the ability to reduce mortality. Fibroplate is proposing a new approach to manage bleeding
in thrombocytopenic patients who develop PTR, based on the intravenous injection of Fibrinoplate-S (FPS),
a ready-to-use suspension of fibrinogen-coated albumin nanospheres. FPS significantly reduces the bleeding
time and improves overall survival rate associated with radiation-induced thrombocytopenia in preclinical
rodent models through the formation of co-aggregates with the residual activated platelets at wound sites on
the endothelium of the blood vessel. Various preclinical studies demonstrated that FPS is safe and does not
induce intravascular coagulation. Remarkably, FPS is not sequestered in the spleen, and FPS specific
antibodies have not been detected after its administration in humans. These characteristics, together with its
hemostatic capacity support the use of FPS in the management of thrombocytopenic patients with immune
and non-immune PTR. However, their efficacy and safety need validation in a thrombocytopenic preclinical
model under PTR conditions. This NIH SBIR Phase I aims at investigating i) the efficacy of FPS in reducing
bleeding parameters in an established (double) model of thrombocytopenia and PTR (TPTR) preclinically in
rabbits and ii) the safety of the proposed approach. By offering effective treatment, Fibroplate is expected to
reduce bleeding complications and improve and promote survival in thrombocytopenic patients with PTR.PROJECT NARRATIVE

The project has an enormous potential impact as the technology could create an entirely new market for drugs and drug delivery strategies impossible with current knowledge. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project focuses on a novel drug delivery platform with unprecedented capabilities. Current technology has limited ability to package and control the release of challenging drugs that are: labile, peptide- or nucleic acid-based, very hydrophilic, or very hydrophobic. The microscopic ceramic microspheres invented in the USA for national defense form the core of the technology, which is now repurposed to advance the national health and welfare. They have a thin, porous shell and a large, hollow interior that can be loaded with solids, liquids, or even gasses. The microspheres can then be sealed, and the payload released over time. This project's overall goal is to develop the drug delivery platform by focusing on a predicate proof-of-concept: achieving extended, controlled release of the anti-malarial drug Artemether over one day or longer. Challenges include developing novel ways of reliably loading and sealing the microspheres with a waxy hydrophobic drug, new methods of analyzing the product, and optimizing the drug's programmed release over time.

The proposed technology can create new paradigms shift in industrial drying technology which directly addresses one of the key ARPA-E mission areas in “advancing non-evaporative dehydration and drying technologies.”
Invented in 2015 at ORNL and exclusively licensed by UTS in 2018, direct contact ultrasonic drying is a novel non-evaporative dewatering process which does not use any heat and therefore makes an ideal technology to significantly lower the energy required for industrial drying process. The technology mechanically removes water by shaking the object rapidly, on the micron scale, using piezoelectric transducers. Water is mechanically removed in the form of cold mist. By separating water mechanically without evaporation, the technology demonstrated 5X higher efficiency and 2-3X faster drying rate on a typical textile samples.
The proposed ARPA-E funding enables Ultrasonic Technology Solutions (UTS) to develop and demonstrate a proof of concept prototype enabling to expand the application of the technology from batch process into continuous process, enabling easy integration of the technology into roll to roll manufacturing production lines. When successful, the direct contact ultrasonic dryer compatible with the roll to roll manufacturing will have enormous applications in textile, pulp and paper, chemical, carbon fiber and food and dehydration industries.

ATA has developed a software toolset, known as the Multiphysics Engine, capable of modeling many of these hypersonic phenomena. It couples state-of-the-art solvers for CFD (Loci/CHEM), ablation (CHAR), and mechanical response (Abaqus) and is capable of simulating the ablation response of advanced thermal protection system (TPS) materials like composite carbon-carbon in hypersonic environments. In the proposed effort, the project team will enhance the Multiphysics Engine by adding models to accurately and efficiently simulate ionized plasma and incorporate a computational electromagnetics (CEM) solver into the workflow for RCS prediction. \n\n The Phase I effort will focus on improving the plasma dynamics modeling capability in Loci/CHEM and incorporating a new coupling between Loci/CHEM and the CEM solver to enable RCS prediction. The computational efficiency of plasma simulations will be improved by adapting ATA’s Damköhler In-Situ Targeted Adaptive Numerical Thermochemistry (DISTANT) finite-rate chemical reaction model to nonequilibrium and ionized flows. The plasma dynamics modeling capability will be preliminarily validated and the advantage provided by DISTANT quantified by comparing predictions to experimental data from open literature. The new RCS modeling capability will be demonstrated by estimating the RCS for a test body. In Phase II, ATA will conduct more rigorous validation activities and implement additional enhancements, including developing a new magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) capability for Loci/CHEM to model ionized hypersonic flow in the presence of electromagnetic fields. The resulting toolset will deliver a new capability for GEOINT analysis of hypersonic systems via an integrated means of modeling the influence of ionized flow around an ablating hypersonic vehicle on the observable RCS, including the effect of plasma flow control devices.",Renato  Jelic,,,renato.jelic@nga.mil,Michael  Nucci,,(858) 480-2071,michael.nucci@ata-e.com,,  ,

Relative to the virtual machine, it will be operating in a real-time environment, even when running on a non-real-time platform, such as those commonly found on commodity development platforms running a general-purpose operating system such as Linux. This will allow real-time and latency-sensitive dynamics to be simulated and tested by commodity systems to a higher degree of accuracy, without the use of any other dedicated physical platform.

In response to this need, Corvid Technologies (Corvid) proposes the investigation, development, and demonstration of a practical numerical framework for computational grid adaptation to improve modeling of hypersonic flowfields and thus greatly reduce the cost involved in computing accurate surface heating on hypersonic systems using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Ultimately, Corvid will develop a robust, flexible and production-ready grid adaptation capability that would significantly shorten the time required to predict accurate aerothermodynamic environments. To date, several adaptation strategies have been matured but no capability has been developed for use in a production CFD setting to resolve wall heat transfer on unstructured meshes. Furthermore, such a solution would provide a consistent process that could be leveraged across different CFD cases, CFD solvers, programs, and throughout industry. Since grid generation is typically one of the first steps required in all CFD simulations, this capability would be impactful for all types of CFD simulations including perfect gas cases, chemically reacting cases, multiphase flows, shock interaction problems, coupled fluid/thermal/structural simulations, turbulent flows, and others. \n\n Corvid’s approach will address one of the most time-consuming, but critical, components of hypersonic simulations: mesh generation. Corvid will leverage its in-house computational resources, software development capabilities, aerothermodynamic expertise, and grid-generation approaches to implement a robust, grid adaptation capability for mixed-element unstructured meshes. By simply providing an initial (unadapted) grid, flow conditions, vehicle attitude, and target error metrics, a final, converged CFD solution with accurately resolved wall heat transfer will be produced. During Phase I, Corvid will implement and demonstrate different mesh mechanic strategies on unstructured grids into a robust, comprehensive capability. The proposed capability will be able to adapt the mesh to bulk flow features (shocks, shear layers) and to boundary layer gradients in prismatic layers typical of unstructured grids. Corvid plans to implement this process around our in-house CFD solver (RavenCFD) to expedite the implementation, testing, and validation being proposed. This technology will be validated against aerothermal test data on select hypersonic cases in Phase I. Corvid estimates that an automated approach could improve overall time to solution by 50% with an accompanying increase in accuracy.",Renato  Jelic,,,renato.jelic@nga.mil,Giovanni  Salazar,,(704) 799-6944,giovanni.salazar@corvidtec.com,,  ,

Effective decontamination strategies that eliminate the biowarfare agents prior to human exposure can help mitigate risks associated with exposure. Traditional decontamination techniques rely on “wet” solutions such as chemicals including bleach. However, these decontaminants are unsuitable for sensitive equipment (e.g. communications equipment) which cannot be exposed to chemical decontaminants or strong oxidizing or caustic solutions. Plasmas consisting of ionized gases, radicals and free electrons can effectively remove all organic contaminants from surfaces and offer a suitable alternative for decontamination of sensitive equipment. Current plasma generation technologies, however, rely on bulky equipment as well as utilizing noble gases making them unsuitable for field use. To address these limitations, the overall objective of the proposed project is to develop a man-portable cold plasma system that utilizes air or mixtures thereof for biowarfare agent decontamination.

Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, there remains over 257 million people chronicallyinfected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) world-wide. Individuals with chronic HBV infections are at risk forcomplications due to liver disease and liver cancer. Chronic HBV is currently managed with nucleos(t)idereverse transcriptase inhibitors (NrtI) which partly suppress HBV DNA replication, normalize alanineaminotransferase levels (ALT) and slow disease progression. Front-line therapies, however, are not curativeand patients with chronic HBV exhibit poor off-treatment responses requiring life-long therapy. New antiviralsand immunomodulatory approaches are, therefore, needed to further suppress viral replication and provide theconditions that are required for immune control known as a “functional cure”. One of the most promisingclasses of compounds under investigation are the core protein allosteric modulators (CpAM) that block HBVreplication at multiple stages of the viral life-cycle. Here, we report on a best-in-class CpAM that exhibits potentpan-genotypic antiviral activity. In this project, we propose to advance our lead CpAM into definitive IND enabling studies to ready the compound for Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers and chronic HBVpatients. Combination regimens that include a CpAM, antivirals possessing distinct mechanisms of actionand/or novel immunomodulatory agents will be evaluated in a mouse model of HBV infection in preparation forPhase 2 development in chronic HBV patienst.",  ,,,,GLEN A COBURN,,(610) 644-8935,coburn@venatorx.com,,  ,

The purpose of the work effort is to develop a concept for a non-intrusive device for attaching specialized Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) tools to underwater threat objects that can neutralize these threats. The solution developed must be effective on various surface materials and attachable on target objects that are on the seabed and in the water column with current speeds up to 14 m/s. To address these operational requirements, Zero-G Horizons Technologies, LLC. (ZGHT) aims to develop and deliver the Gecko-gripper for EOD with Cavitation Cleaning Operation (GECCO) system. GECCO is a system that can be integrated with existing Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) or EOD Underwater Response Vehicles (URVs), which includes Teledyne SeaBotix vLBV300, SRS Fusion, and VideoRay Defender, that enables rapid attachment of EOD tools or other payloads on a submerged target surface, such as underwater threat object (UTO). In most cases, the surface of a submerged target surface will be covered in biofouling, prevents firm adhesion to the surface. Also, the geometry and roughness of the surface will be flat, curved, smooth, or irregular. To deal with these problems, GECCO will remove the biofouling growth or other sediments on the target area using our controlled cavitation technology (CCT) and an underwater vacuuming mechanism. CCT can effectively remove biofouling on various surface materials and scale to a larger area with a shorter removal time. The ZGHT-developed vacuuming mechanism also supplements CCT-cleaning to clean loose biofouling and debris. The soft-robotics technology is employed for the gripper so that it can maintain grip by conforming to the target surface geometry. Moreover, it can be customizable and scalable for new designs. Biomimetic mechanisms that imitate the suction cups of an octopus, or a squid, were very effective. Preliminary results show that the suction-cup-inspired mechanism is a promising mechanism for the GECCO system. The added advantage is easy removal of the attached device by relieving the pressure without residuals. The objective of the Phase II effort is develop and integrate the biofouling cleaning and payload attaching subsystems into a full GECCO system. Supporting subsystems will encompass power supply, vehicle-ROV integration, and GECCO transport. Once implemented, the completed GECCO system will be validated through testing and evaluation in laboratory and field environments.  Laboratory-based testing will entail experimental replication of wave action, pressure environments, and current velocities that are anticipated during operational deployment.

Diabetic neuropathy (DPN) is a major unmet health concern where over half of the estimated 33 million people
in the US with type 1 or type 2 diabetes will develop neuropathy1. There is no FDA-approved disease modifying
treatment for preventing or slowing progression of diabetic neuropathy other than a recommendation to maintain
glycemic control2 and current treatments are restricted to management of the symptomatic consequences of
neuropathy such as pain. It is becoming increasingly appreciated that diabetes also injures both the spinal cord
(myelopathy) and brain (encephalopathy) such that diabetes is recognized as a prominent risk factor for
developing cognitive dysfunction and Alzheimer’s disease14. Accordingly, agents that prevent or reverse
peripheral nerve and/or CNS insults during diabetes are of interest either as standalone agents or for adjunctive
use with symptomatic treatments. Epigen has developed expertise around the discovery and development of
novel lysophosphatidic acid receptor type 1 (LPAR1) antagonists for the treatment of fibrotic disease. In parallel
to the study of diabetic nephropathy data was obtained to suggest that lead compounds discovered at Epigen
also benefit endpoints of diabetic neuropathy for both nerve injury and markers for cognitive decline in models.
This proposal builds on these data to determine if one such lead compound, EPGN2154, may be developed to
treat diabetic neuropathy. The goal of this direct to phase 2 application is to conduct detailed pre-clinical efficacy
of EPGN2154 in rat DPN models, along with screening safety to allow nomination of a development candidate.
Compounds will be prepared and characterized at Epigen prior to testing at University of California San Diego
(UCSD) under the guidance of Dr. Nigel Calcutt. Dr. Calcutt’s laboratory will establish and maintain colonies of
diabetic rodents, treat them with test agents provided by Epigen and measure physiological, behavioral and
structural indices of peripheral and central neuropathy at assorted times throughout the study. Upon study
completion tissue will be dissected and processed for histological and biochemical evaluation to support
behavioral measurements. Epigen will conduct additional lead profiling to support candidacy of EPGN2154. Drug
distribution will also be evaluated to support mechanistic studies. Compound profiling will include a safety
assessment of EPGN2154. These studies will support the advancement of EPGN2154 to IND enabling studies
as a prelude to entry into clinical trials for DPN.",  ,,,,GRAHAM  BEATON,,(858) 657-0918,gbepigen@gmail.com,,  ,

a newly emerging artemisinin resistant parasite line. New compounds are low in toxicity and possess good
therapeutic indice. This SBIR Phase I project aims to obtain proof of concept in vivo PK, efficacy, and
toxicity data. Studies include: (I) Scale up isolation and purification of natural product and synthesis of
derivative compounds; (II) Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies; (III) In vivo efficacy studies in SCID mouse P.
falciparum model; (IV) In vivo evaluation for acute and sub-acute toxicity, developmental toxicity, and
neurotoxicity. The novelty of the project is the discovery of new molecular entities. The project involves
standard approaches to drug development, but the multidisciplinary team that has been assembled will
accelerate the generation of preclinical candidates.PROJECT NARRATIVEMalaria is one of the most common infectious diseases in the world. It infects 228 million and kills
about 405,000 people in a year. The increasing prevalence of multiple drug resistant strains in most
malaria endemic areas has significantly reduced the efficacy of current antimalarial drugs for prophylaxis
and treatment of this disease. This project focuses on the development of a novel therapeutic agent for
preventing and treating P. falciparum malaria. The novelty of the research is the discovery of new

Unfortunately, bearings are a challenge in this class of machines due to a combination of very high shaft speeds and high axial loads. High shaft speeds are required for small single-stage gas turbines to maintain adequate pressure ratio for acceptable efficiency. High axial loads result from static pressure acting on various faces on the rotor. This load can be offset using a rotating balance piston but sometimes length, cycle penalty and packaging constraints do not permit this. High shaft speed results in very high n x dM and dN values. With oil lubrication there are associated plumbing challenges and volume and weight penalties. In the case of foil bearings, cooling air can penalize the engine cycle. The reduction of rotor thrust has positive implications for reducing heat, mass and parasitic losses of both bearing types while significantly increasing fatigue life and reliability of rolling-element bearings. The objective of this Phase II effort is to integrate the rotor thrust management technique, studied in Phase I, into an existing turboalternator and demonstrate improvements in bearing life.",Charles L.

Since demand is often fueled by temperature, wholesale electricity prices spike as utilities attempt to balance load. Typically, any electric grid user would pay some percentage of their whole electricity costs for their peak demand so large energy users such as factories or manufacturing plants among others, are well aware of the opportunity to reduce costs by managing peak demand. Blue Ocean Energy, LLC (BOE) identified a gap in the market for a Demand Response product and therefore, we are developing our Adaptive Demand Management Platform (ADM). Blue Ocean Energy understands the Air Force’s organizational environment, and their needs for efficient energy management, optimization, and costs savings since it is a significant energy user. Our proposal is focused on an innovative and unique approach to peak demand optimization through a platform able to dynamically ingest data from multiple smart thermostats and adjust and predictively adapt the functioning of HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning ) units, resulting in significant energy and costs savings. The ADM is an energy management platform developed by BOE that provides continuous optimal zonal thermal comfort in different indoor spaces while automatically optimizing energy consumption (minimizing simultaneous runtimes). It consists of thermostats, a gateway and a cloudbased software with machine learning (ML) algorithms controlling each individual thermostat in a facility. Our smart thermostats collect realtime data on ambient parameters and send it to our cloud systems. There, our machine learning algorithms analyze data with the objective of minimizing the simultaneous runtimes (SRT) of the facility’s HVAC units remotely controlling them. The algorithms minimize SRT utilizing (1) Learning, (2) Predictive and (3) Deadband flexibility (DBF) features to achieve this objective. We use load shifting to manage demand (kW), avoiding Simultaneous Run Time (SRT) of the units in order to reduce peak demand costs. The key point, essence of the ADM, is that using the same amount of energy (kWh) could achieve significant savings by simply “shifting” operations of the units, thus decreasing peak demand charges (kW).",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,support@afwerx.af.mil,Bo  Petersen,,(512) 600-7060,blueoceanenergy@outlook.com,,  ,

After transmitting the multiplexed signal over a free-space or fiber link, a complimentary device at the receiver will de-multiplex the photons and a second set of frequency shifters will shift the wavelengths back to original native frequency of the quantum memoryrsquo;s register. Within Phase I, we will design and demonstrate a compact on-chip, high-efficiency frequency shifter operating at a native quantum memory wavelength using an approach that can be readily adapted to any existing quantum memory configuration at visible and near-infrared wavelengths.

They are high performance detectors in ground-based applications, however InGaAs detectors are not suitable for space-based applications because their dark current performance significantly deteriorates during exposure to ionizing radiation. Literature reports indicate that over a several year space mission, InGaAs detectorsrsquo; dark current can increase by a factor of 10 ndash; 25 x, which increases power consumption and produces excess noise. An alternative to InGaAs is the semiconductor material GaSb. The two materials have similar bandgap energies leading to similar nominal performance characteristics, however GaSb has more favorably located fundamental defect energies than InGaAs, which will produce superior radiation tolerance through reduced defect-related dark current generation in the presence of space-based radiation.This program will develop GaSb detectors with nominal performance equal to conventional InGaAs telecom detectors, but with greatly improved radiation hardness. The key innovation in this proposal is to assess radiation tolerance by considering defect-related energy levels in the detectors#39; semiconductor materials. The main defect level in InGaAs is at an energy of 0.46 eV above the valence band. This is near the middle of the bandgap, which from a dark current perspective is the worst possible scenario. In contrast, the main defect level in GaSb is at an energy of 0.26 eV above the valence band, which is sufficiently far away from midgap to enable significant reduction in defect-related dark current generation. This can be seen from the well-known equation for Shockley-Read-Hall generation, which shows that the electron-hole generation rate, and thus also the radiation-induced dark current, of InGaAs defects are more than 40 x times greater than those of GaSb defects.",NASA SBIR  Support Office,,(301) 937-0888,sbir@reisystems.com,Daniel  Sidor,,(484) 883-5190,sidor@amethystresearch.com,,  ,

By partially deflating the balloon, a reduced flow state can be accomplished to allow perfusion of distal tissue and mitigate ischemic injury, but this has been difficult to manage. Fluid dynamics show that flow restriction through an orifice is linearly proportional to its cross sectional area. As the cross sectional area doubles, so does the flow. However, the cross sectional area of a circle is exponentially proportional to its radius, so small changes in diameter of a fully inflated REBOA balloon cause extreme changes in flow. Due to the compliance of the balloon and vessel wall, this makes the flow rate extremely difficult to manage at high inflation volumes (i.e. the low flow rates desired in these scenarios). Our solution changes the locus of flow control from the external surface of the occluding balloon to an interior lumen created by using a concentric set of toroidal balloons. This provides higher sensitivity of flow control at lower flow rates. We propose to create this method of occlusion by replicating the physical characteristics of an orifice plate commonly used in industrial hydraulic flow control using concentric balloons. To increase the performance of our system further, we will monitor the blood pressure differential across the occlusion and vary the orifice diameter with automated controls in a closed feedback loop to maintain a consistent flow rate during changing hemodynamics. Blood pressure will be sensed through two membranes on the distal end of the catheter and translated through a sterile fluid to sensors integrated in the proximal end; external to the body.

ThermAvant Technologies, LLC proposes a novel TMS based on the companyrsquo;s flagship technology: structurally embedded oscillating heat pipes (OHPs). The OHP is a passive two-phase heat transfer device that relies on concentrated heat loads to passively drive a working fluid through a high-density array of microchannels, which are ideal for embedding within thin structures such as a structural skin. Without the need for the wick structures of their conventional predecessor heat pipes, OHPs are especially well suited for integration into materials within which it is difficult to construct traditional heat pipes. In addition to the absence of a wick structure, the OHPrsquo;s unique I-beam architecture (formed by the walls between the microchannels) enables the structure to be multifunctional and serve as a structural member with integrated passive thermal management. Furthermore, through the use of additive manufacturing technology, these devices can be deeply integrated within the structure of EAP systems.
These high-conductance, embedded devices will provide significant improvements to power density by both decreasing thermal impedance and reducing mass, and provide additional design freedom for the layout of heat generating components within the EAP system while still providing improved thermal performance.

The objective of Phase I is to implement an infrasonic processing system that classifies infrasound as originating from a region of aircraft-scale turbulence. Previous theoretical and observational studies have found that infrasound associated with atmospheric turbulence exhibits a power-law spectrum with low overall coherence, a feature shared by infrasonic emissions from atmospheric convection. Therefore the initial classifier design will compare infrasonic signal characteristics with convective indicators such as NEXRAD and lightning strike data. The existence of aircraft scale turbulence will be determined by collecting in situ pilot reports in the region of the infrasonic sensor array. The classifier will be applied to data measured by an array of three highly sensitive, NASA-developed electret microphones. An off-the-shelf spatiotemporal database containing infrasonic analyses and meteorological data will enable an innovative data analysis with two aims. First, the performance of the classifier will be gauged by a sensitivity analysis and by studying missed events/false alarms for physical insight. Second, the detected turbulence events will be used to develop a more complete model of infrasonic emissions from aircraft-scale turbulence.

Food allergies affect 15 million people in the USA and 17 million in Europe. Six million children, roughly 1 in 13,
in the USA have at least one food allergy; this equates to at least 1 in every classroom. Currently, there are no
approved therapies for food allergies anywhere in the world. Food allergies are expected to grow 10% annually
until 2022. It is also common for someone to have more than one allergy. This is a growing, underserved
global market that has few treatment options. A meaningful initial therapy would be one that reduces the
chance for anaphylactic reaction after accidental exposure. Based on surveys, allergists and patients believe a
therapy that reduces the chance for anaphylactic reaction from accidental exposure is meaningful and
worthwhile. Such a therapy will help bring peace of mind to families, allow for children affected by food
allergies to have better quality of life, feel less socially out casted and most importantly reduce the potential for
death from accidental procedure. The approximate healthcare burden per patient is $3,000-4,000 per year.
Moonlight Therapeutics is developing a targeted way to administer peanut allergens into the top skin layers to
desensitize an allergic patient. Delivery is achieved using microneedles, which are minimally invasive and
painless. Importantly microneedles can deliver into topmost skin layers with high precision and reproducibility.
Because the delivery is in top and superficial skin layers, the approach is expected to produce little to no
systemic adverse reactions. We have demonstrated efficacy of our approach in a pre-clinical mouse model of
peanut sensitization. In this STTR Fast-Track grant application Moonlight Therapeutics has proposed aims that
will allow it to file an investigational new drug (IND) application with the FDA for first-in-human trials. In Phase
1, four aims are proposed to develop processes for producing peanut allergen proteins and coated MNs with
strict quality assurance and operating procedures that can be transferred to cGMP production. An efficacy
study in animals is also proposed in Phase 1. Appropriate milestones and success criteria have been
established for Phase-1. In Phase-2, four aims are proposed so as to perform non-GLP (good laboratory
practices) and GLP toxicity studies, and establish production under cGMP. In addition, animal studies will be
done to compare microneedles to a conventional skin patch. At the conclusion of Phase-2 an IND application
will be submitted to the FDA.
Overall, these studies will provide the foundation to support the development of a novel and safer peanut
allergy immunotherapy treatment.The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel treatment approach for peanut allergies. Presently no FDA-approved
treatment exists to treat peanut or other food allergies. The technology proposed in this project has
the potential to offer a treatment option not just for peanut but other food allergies as well.",  ,,,,SAMIRKUMAR  PATEL,,(404) 348-8294,samir.patel@moonlighttx.com,TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY,  ,

The state-of-the-art computational fluid dynamic (CFD) capabilities, however, still have many limitations in terms of accuracy, fidelity, and robustness which need to be addressed. For example, a 3-D Navier-Stokes solution with thermal and chemical nonequilibrium requires on the order of weeks to develop a sensible grid, the gridded geometry must be greatly simplified, requires careful monitoring of the solution as it runs since the problems are numerically ldquo;stiffrdquo; and are quick to ldquo;crashrdquo;, and the solution accuracy is limited by the numerical schemes employed.In response to this need, we propose to develop a compressible CFD solver employing a novel moving Discontinuous Galerkin with Interface Conservation Enforcement (MDG+ICE) approach including thermal and chemical non-equilibrium physics.

The MDG+ICE method represents a fundamentally grounded and break-through approach, and is specifically designed for flows with discontinuities and therefore especially attractive for hypersonic flows.

A magnesium oxide (MgO)-containing co-feed (and other mineral co-feeds can be added before combustion for a twofold effect: 1) acting as an anti-slagging agent or flocculant to protect against slag buildup on an incinerator’s heat transfer boiler tubes; and 2) sequestering gases, harmful chemicals, and heavy metals, while simultaneously being co-calcined. This cement is a chemically based cement rather than OPC, in which heat of 1300°C is required and sets up in about a month for a compressive strength of average 3000 psi. Our cement uses no heat, gives off no CO2, hardens quickly, and averages high strength.

Development of a charge sensitive optical detection system for high-throughput study of small molecules
SUMMARY
Measuring the kinetics of small molecule binding to protein receptors and biochemical reactions of proteins, such
as post-translational protein modifications, is a basic task in the understanding of diseases, discovering of
diagnosis biomarkers, and screening of drugs. Various label-free techniques have been developed, but their
sensitivity decreases with the molecular mass, which makes it challenging to detect small molecules and
biochemical reactions. A charge sensitive optical detection (CSOD) system is proposed to address this unmet
need. The technology is not only sensitive to small molecules, but also compatible with the standard microplate
technology, which is particularly suitable for high-throughput applications. The working principle was established
and validated with the support of NIH NCI IMAT (Innovative Molecular Analysis Technologies for cancer
research) grants (R21 and R33) to the Arizona State University (ASU) team. In this SBIR direct phase II project,
Biosensing Instrument Inc. (BI) will work with the ASU team to develop a commercially viable prototype system.
We will continue collaborations with potential customers in biomedical research and pharmaceutical industries
for testing samples relevant to their interest and validating the performance usability of the developing system.The success of the project will lead to a new high-throughput screening technology for measuring molecular
interactions, particularly small molecule interactions with proteins, and post-translational modifications of
proteins. These processes are highly important for biomarker discovery, disease diagnosis and drug screening.",  ,,,,NGUYEN  LY,,(480) 491-2777,nly@biosensingusa.com,,  ,

In previous work, large volumetric fractions of Au, Ag, and Cu nanoparticles (NPs) were incorporated into a porous aramid nanofiber (ANF) matrix to realize films that have high electrical conductivity, yet maintain superior mechanical strength, properties that are usually hard to achieve simultaneously. Furthermore, the composite films demonstrate excellent flexibility, which is superior to other related classes of reported flexible conductors including carbon based nanomaterials (CNTs and graphene) and other metallic materials. The unique network structure enables high electrical conductivity and robust mechanical behavior of the metal-ANF films. Most pertinently for mass-restrictive applications, we previously demonstrated that copper-ANF composites had ~90 % less mass density than solid copper, but with electrical properties (conductivity, ampacity) that were at least 33 % of the bulk value. During Phase I, we will extend the material system to aluminum structural components that are relevant to sample-return missions that require mass-efficient materials. We will first find the lower limits of achievable mass that still provides acceptable conductivity, ampacity, and strength in both cylindrical and polygonal cross-sectional solids. We will then characterize the conductive and insulating properties of self-insulated solids, in which the ANF can be functionalized with various levels of conductivity. We can control the optical properties of the Al-ANF composite by modifying the surface plasmon resonance of the aluminum NPs, knowledge that will be used to make solids of various optical properties. Finally, we will design manufacturing tools to scale-up the production of the solids.nbsp;",NASA SBIR  Support Office,,(301) 937-0888,sbir@reisystems.com,Suneel  Joglekar,,(765) 609-1308,suneel@amphionic.com,,  ,

Even accidental or brief exposure can have devastating consequences. Therefore, there is a crucial need to develop a method to decontaminate devices and equipment to minimize exposure risks and maintain operations after a chemical attack or release. Vaporous hydrogen peroxide (VHP) is an ideal decontamination method due to its low vapor temperature, lack of harmful residues, fast decontamination cycles, and ability to infiltrate. However, VHP requires concentrated (~35%) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in large quantities, which is hazardous, degrades quickly, and may react violently with organics, catalysts, or impurities. H2O2 is therefore confined to ground transportation and is problematic to store, calling for a mobile on-demand concentrated H2O2 production. CRG will develop a portable H2O2 generator that uses direct electrosynthesis of H2O2. CRG’s system will have limited to no consumables and only require water and air to produce H2O2 without any harmful by-products. CRG’s compact flow cell device will provide a modular system that can be stacked in parallel to increase production rates, in series to increase concentration, or a in combination thereof. Therefore, CRG’s electrochemical synthesis system could provide on-demand H2O2 for vaporous decontamination for the CBD and broader military. Additionally, numerous other commercial applications, apart from VHP, could benefit on-demand H2O2 generation, such as remote water treatment, primary consumer goods, and direct integration with consumer appliances.",Stefanie  Smallwood,,(703) 417-1512,stefanie.q.smallwood.civ@mail.mil,Frank  Zalar,,(937) 320-1877,zalarfm@crgrp.com,,  ,

Koronis Biomedical Technologies (KBT) proposes to develop and fully evaluate a renal replacement therapy
(RRT) machine specifically targeted for critically-ill small children and neonates with acute kidney injury (AKI),
fluid overload, and kidney failure. In recent years, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has emerged
as the preferred method for providing kidney support to these patients, especially those who are
hemodynamically unstable. Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) is a form of CRRT built on
hemofiltration: waste products and fluid in plasma are removed from the blood by a pressure gradient over a
filter, while a replacement fluid is infused to maintain fluid balance. Unfortunately, neonates infrequently
receive renal replacement therapy due to the technical challenges of traditional CRRT machines that make
therapy initiation very difficult, even at experienced tertiary children’s hospitals. Machines designed for adult-
sized patients, but commonly used in pediatric care, require large catheters, tubing, and filters. This results in a
high extracorporeal volume (ECV, the total volume of blood in the external circuit—the tubing and hemofilter)
relative to a small patient’s size, as well as higher blood flows, higher clearance rates, and higher risks.
Numerous medical centers do not even offer CRRT to infants, let alone for critically-ill neonates or premature
infants, due to the inherent risks. At therapy initiation, a volume of fluid roughly equivalent to the ECV must be
injected into the blood circuit to “prime” the pump. For CRRT in larger children and adults, the priming fluid is
simply saline. If, however, the amount of fluid required to prime the circuit is greater than 10% of the patient’s
total blood volume, the saline fluid could significantly dilute the patient’s blood, leading to hemodynamic
instability. To avoid this outcome, a donor “blood prime” is used, though it is not without risks, such as
hypocalcemia, acidosis, hyperkalemia, and a loss of platelets and coagulation functions. KBT’s Phase II SBIR
project proposes to bring a new CRRT device with a lower ECV to market that is specifically targeted for small
children and neonates, eliminating the need for blood primes. The performance and safety of the proposed
highly integrated CRRT system will be evaluated in a clinical trial.",  ,,,,ROBERT J KNUESEL,,(612) 730-1091,rknuesel@koronisbiotech.com,,  ,

This impairs piloting performance during landing and will pose further safety risks in future lunar and planetary missions while landing and performing tasks post-g-level transitions. We propose a wearable device that applies galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) to induce spatial disorientation in response to head-tilt, to artificially replicate the sensation astronauts experience upon g-level transitions. GVS waveform parameters will depend upon tilt orientation and angular velocity as detected by an IMU. The device will comprise multiple electrodes capable of inducing illusory motion in both pitch and roll axes.

This system was featured in NASA Tech Briefs.For this new study, we propose to merge the air filtration techniques learned from the earlier study, which revealed that airborne microorganisms could be captured by electrospray, and to direct those captured trace species into a mass analyzer for identification via metabolomic data.",NASA SBIR  Support Office,,(301) 937-0888,sbir@reisystems.com,Joseph  Bango,,(203) 393-9666,jbango@ctanalytical.com,,  ,

These new mission regimes are more challenging and require greater onboard autonomy capabilities to act and plan without a ground system in the loop. To address this need, we propose to develop an onboard planning capability for smallsats. This software enables constellations or swarms to respond dynamically to failures and opportunities independent of ground systems. The innovation addresses specific gaps in the state of the art identified in our subtopic to enable operation of swarms without the need for ground system commanding. We identify two critical qualities the planner should have. First is the ability to construct a plan that incorporates likely exception information as a safety check. This reduces the frequency of replanning and builds in robustness to exceptions that are well-understood by the operator. The second quality is a standard interface with specialized ldquo;subplannersrdquo; for functions like maneuvers, constellation design, and so on. This second ability ensures the planning software can interact flexibly with external software, which may be mandated for particular applications. Subplanners are also an appealing approach for decomposing a large planning problem into more tractable sub-problems.

Previous work by ASTER Labs has demonstrated concept feasibility of X-ray navigation (XNAV) and gamma-ray navigation (GLINT) as stand-alone architectures. The HYNAV instrument unifies the two individual concepts while adding radio observations into an operational prototype hardware instrument and software package. The advantage of the blended approach is it exploits both the periodic nature of the faint, stable radio and X-ray pulsars with the aperiodic, transient nature of bright, chaotic fast radio and gamma-ray bursts.

Although creating observation plans is usually relegated to the flight operations period of a mission, teams can benefit by considering these observation designs during early stages of mission planning as well. Collaboration between science teams and operations teams requires a complex web of cumbersome technology for sharing and integrating observation plans and their resulting data.

Results can be updated and displayed to operators (i.e., air traffic controllers and pilots) as each arrival flight approaches the airport.

7. PROJECT SUMMARY
Inconsistency of growth media for cell culture is a significant problem in both industry and academia that has
plagued laboratories for decades. In biopharma, cell-based and cell-derived therapies are growing at a
tremendous rate and require well-defined, animal-free components to meet FDA and cGMP regulations. It is
therefore not surprising that there is an increased need for and adoption of serum-free media for cell culture
growth that is attributed to its superior batch-to-batch consistency and reduced risk of unwanted
animal/xenobiotic contaminants. This is particularly critical to human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), a
rapidly evolving technology with wide research and clinical application. These cells present numerous
advantages compared to previous technologies, including human origin, the ability to form multi-class cell
systems and tissues, relative ease of production and modification, and functional relevance. Robust and well-
characterized protocols are of utmost importance when culturing hiPSCs for downstream applications. High
pluripotency, genetic stability, large-scale production and maintained function all must be kept in mind for
hiPSCs. Yet despite the array of defined media now available for iPSCs, many of these media fail to satisfy the
full needs of hiPSC research, including robustness over multiple passages and experimental needs, low cost,
ease of production, weekend-free media changes and fully defined components. Such traits are critical for robust,
consistent and affordable research in the hiPSC space.
Just this year, our Defined Bioscience team empirically tested common defined media components over a large
array of concentrations and combinations, isolating a well-defined recipe with high robustness, efficacy over
rt100 cell passages, and maintained success in a weekend-free passaging schedule. This media, termed B8 by
the lab of scientific advisory board member Paul Burridge, met or exceeded the expectations for a Phase I SBIR
development proposal. Here we will extend this work to prepare HiDef B8, a formulation of B8 finalized to optimal
component concentrations and reduced cost. This optimized formulation will be tested across academic and
industrial labs in the United States to confirm robustness and efficacy in streamlined and applied hiPSC culture
and methodologies. We intend to make HiDef B8 an affordable, defined media for robust hiPSC culture across
high passage numbers and in a weekend-free context, significantly reducing the cost and complexity of hiPSC
technologies across the field. This will enable stable cell culture and a well-characterized starting point for

Relatedness to Mission: Application aligns with 2019 Supplemental Goals for both NINR and NIA.:
NINR: Assistive…devices that can… improve quality of life for individuals with chronic diseases/conditions
NIA: Development of technologies/robotics to assist in the improvement of physical function and mobility in
older persons prior to (pre-habilitation) or following (rehabilitation) elective/planned surgery
Medical need: This application focuses on secondary prevention of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) when patients
are most vulnerable. DFU is the leading cause of amputation, more costly than the most expensive cancer, and
survivors of lower limb amputation have a higher mortality rate than half of the top 10 cancers.
Invention: Together with patient input, team has designed a novel assistive exoskeleton that has been shown
in Ph I studies to off-load pressure from the foot by deploying a disruptive design for rehabilitation robotics. It
integrates a structural exo-skeleton to externalize lower limb forces outside of the body. In two Phase I studies,
the exoskeleton has demonstrated reduction of force under the forefoot. Unexpectedly, the device has also
demonstrated improved propulsion by increasing stride length and walking speed concurrent to reducing
plantar pressures. The device has received enthusiastic patient feedback from multiple participants who

Aim 1) Product Refinement Engineering: Team will improve upon Ph I prototypes to overcome issues with
comfort and to ensure durability and robustness.
Aim 2) Motor Restoration of Gait and Balance, Activity, Psycho-Social: The prototypes will be evaluated for
their ability to help restore clinical gait function and balance at 1, 3 and 6 months after completion of wound
healing subsequent to DFU treatment as well as their impact on the restoration of daily physical activity level
and psycho social measures. Efficacy (recurrence rates) are beyond the available budget of SBIR and will be
pursued with collaborative university led research.
Rationale: The team recently completed two Phase I SBIR funded studies through NIH/National Institute of
Nursing Research and ACL/National Institute for Disability, Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research.
Results show that the prototypes were able to off-load significant pressure by externalizing forces. Team has
been awarded 4 issued US patents and international IP. If successful, this will be the first disruptive
innovation in off-loading in decades and illuminates key design factors for future evaluation of robotic off-

While major strides have been made in the development of therapies for melanoma, cases continue to rise, with
more diagnoses occurring at an early stage where surgery is indicated for patients. However, even with standard
of care anti-PD-1 adjuvant immunotherapy, patients still have a high risk of relapse (3-year relapse-free survival
is 50-60%). Neoadjuvant anti-PD-1/anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy has emerged as a potentially more efficacious
alternative to adjuvant immunotherapy, however, widespread usage in these non-metastatic patients would be
precluded due to significant toxicities. Therefore, there is a great unmet need to improve outcomes for
locally/regionally advanced surgically resectable melanoma patients. Cytokine therapies such as interleukin (IL)-
12 and IL-15 have shown promise in pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo studies, however, when delivered systemically
in bolus, their clinical utility is limited due to serious adverse effects as well as suboptimal pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics. Thus, we need to find novel ways to locally modulate the immune system early to limit
toxicity and reduce the risk of recurrence. To address this challenge in melanoma in this NIH Phase I SBIR,
Strand Therapeutics is proposing to engineer a tunable and programmable small molecule-regulated
self-replicating mRNA (repRNA)-based combinatorial cytokine immunotherapy that mimics the
physiological expression kinetics of IL-12 (expressed early) and IL-15 (expressed later). In doing so, this
programmable repRNA immunotherapy is designed to enhance the patient’s own immune system to combat
melanoma tumors and provide durable immune surveillance and remission with limited toxicity. In Aim 1, we will
construct the mRNA circuit and validate expression kinetics of our programmed mRNAs using surrogate
luciferase reporters, which will allow us to assess in vivo expression kinetics in real-time in a mouse model of
melanoma. In Aim 2, we will encode IL-12 and IL-15 in the circuit validated in Aim 1 and assess expression
kinetics and tunability of IL-12/IL-15 expression in a mouse model of melanoma. In Aim 3, we will test if our
engineered circuit can eliminate tumors in vivo in mouse models of melanoma, and benchmark against non-
circuit IL-12/IL-15 delivery approaches such as recombinant cytokines and constitutive expression from mRNAs.
Successful completion of these studies will lead to a novel programmable circuit with IL-12/IL-15 for the treatment
of melanoma. Through this project, we intend to program the natural kinetics of IL-12/IL-15, which will induce
stronger and longer-lasting anti-cancer immune responses and increase the efficacy of anti-PD-1/PD-L1
therapies, without the side-effects linked to systemically delivered cytokines.PROJECT NARRATIVE
While there have been major strides in the development of therapies for melanoma, the number of cases is
increasing, with more diagnoses occurring at an early stage where surgery is indicated; however, locally
advanced patients are still at a high risk of relapse following surgery. To address this unmet need, Strand
Therapeutics is engineering a programmable mRNA circuit with temporal expression of cytokines, interleukin-12

therapy for melanoma. Our proprietary lipid nanoparticles will be used to deliver self-replicating mRNA, which
will temporally express IL-12 and IL-15 directly to the tumor microenvironment (TME), to increase TME
immunogenicity and increase the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, without the side effects linked to systemically

These vehicles center on the use of Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) and offer several benefits in terms of faster, safer, quieter, more efficient and environmentally friendly transportation of passengers and goods. These vehicles are nonetheless complex to design, due, amongst others to the greater number of control effectors present relative to traditional fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft. In addition to conventional control surfaces, each propeller can act as a control effector that influences aircraft dynamic behavior. Control effector actuation stems from flight control laws that are developed after the aircraft design has been finalized. As such, flight control laws are not currently accounted for in the aircraft design process. Inclusion of flight controls within multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) of DEP aircraft can result in more efficient and novel designs. The proposed effort aims to develop a modular MDO software framework for DEP aircraft design that will couple flight controls together with key disciplines such as aerodynamics and structures to meet this need. Resulting designs will leverage the inclusion of open- and closed-loop flight control parameters in the optimization to tailor aircraft sizing and performance.

Globally, this issue causes 820,000 deaths in children under the age of five and costs the United States over $300 billion in preventable medical costs annually. By creating an infant feeding system designed for seamless and stress-free breast and bottle feeding, with the only nipple that is researched and designed to mimic a mother’s shape, feel, and flow, this project can offer families bottle to breast continuity-reducing latching problems while promoting breastfeeding. In accordance with the market demand found in customer discovery, this project will supply the first bottle to come with tele-health support for the breastfeeding journey and immuno-biome feedback with remote stool sampling and microbiome data driven insights to support families on how to feed their child best during the first three years of life. By combining remote tele-health and immuno-biome testing services, this integrative model improves access to preventative care while providing bio-feedback insights that can save the U.S. economy an additional $10B annually. The proposed project addresses the gap in the $114 billion global baby and femtech industry, where 92% of parents who introduce a baby to a bottle are unable to return to breastfeeding for the recommended two years. The majority of women do not continue breastfeeding after 3 months after introducing a bottle when maternity leave ends. In the hospital, preterm infants are invariably exposed to nipples unnaturally fast milk flow, resulting in infant hypoxia, bradycardia, and long term neurological defects. This problem costs hospitals approximately $50 million annually by increasing consultation and length of stay costs. The proposed technology will mimic unique maternal nipple geometry and evolutionary milk flow specifically with regard to dynamic infant suckling pressures. The technical objectives of initial lab testing are to ensure the prototypes closely replicate the mother’s nipple, in terms of shape and volumetric flow rate, the silicone thickness, the media density, and the proprietary, dynamic valve diaphragm. Initial non-inferiority testing will measure if the project reduces latching problems for mothers after discharge, decreases complications for preterm patients, and the daily $3,000 per preterm infant cost to hospitals associated with flow rate of standard nipples in a quarter-long study.

The means to vaccinate either manually or using remote technology exists, but most current methods are expensive, inhumane, or inefficient and identification is limited to photographs, sketches, memory, or RFID microchips. Federal agencies currently spend well over one hundred million dollars to deal with the problem.

There are many clinical situations in which a patient cannot receive curative surgery because of the proximity of the tumor to critical anatomy; for example, the central bile duct in liver cancer. In these cases, patients are forced to decide between a number of non-curative treatments that have poor outcomes and significant side effects. Innovation in early-stage tumor treatments will expand treatment options to under-served communities and patient populations. Liver cancer, for example, disproportionately affects Native Americans, Hispanics, and African-American populations in the US, with as many as 30% to 66% patients never receiving any treatment. One reason is that surgical treatments require significant operating room infrastructure (for example, three-dimensional medical imaging) to provide high-quality outcomes; unfortunately these facilities are concentrated in research hospitals and access is not widespread. The technology developed here will address these tumors, and will apply to the more than 600,000 patients in the US yearly that suffer from cancers of the liver, kidney, lung, and breast. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate feasibility of small-size sensors to transform ablation technology into a first-line treatment for all cancerous tumors. By placing imaging sensors onto the tip of a needle, the device can overcome performance limits encountered when using traditional image guidance. This increased performance, in combination with real-time image analysis, can sense temperature variation in a variety of tissues. The ability to sense temperature variation will be combined with needle tip-based energy delivery to provide an all-in-one closed loop ablation device, with the capability to treat previously untreatable tumors.

Significance: Pre-operative embolization (POE) of meningiomas is an established neuroendovascular procedure
performed to reduce the extensive amount of blood loss that occurs during tumor resection. The current practice
is significantly hampered because of efficacy and safety deficiencies of current embolic agents used off-label for
this indication (none of which are designed specifically for POE). Polyvinyl alcohol particles are the most used
embolic agent, but efficacy data raise concerns of their clinical benefit. Trufill and Onyx are liquid-based embolic
alternatives but are fraught with limitations of their own. For example, Onyx contains toxic solvent that causes
patient pain and discomfort while the technical risks associated with Trufill have negated its wide-spread adoption
in the United States. Thus, there is a need for an easy-to-use, on-label embolic agent designed specifically for POE
of meningiomas that provides safe and complete devascularization. Such an embolic would result in faster and
safer surgical resection, representing a significant evolution in the treatment of meningioma patients.
Approach: In this Direct to Phase II SBIR, Arsenal Medical will advance its shear-thinning biomaterial technology,
a flow responsive embolic (FRE) agent, as a therapy for the POE of meningiomas. For POE to be effective, complete
devascularization of the meningioma is desired, which is achieved by total occlusion of all distal vessels that supply
the tumor. Our Phase I results have demonstrated that the FRE exhibits superior distal penetration compared to
commercial liquid embolics, is biocompatible, and can be manually injected through a neurovascular
microcatheter. The goal of this proposal is to advance the proof-of-concept formulation towards a product
configuration that is ready for clinical testing via an early feasibility study (EFS), enabling an efficient path to
commercialization. In Aim 1, we will finalize the delivery system and affirm the product’s usability with clinicians.
Aim 2 will consist of selection of a commercially viable sterilization method, followed by confirmation of product
shelf-life. Biocompatibility of the FRE will be confirmed via a pre-clinical study to determine the neurovascular
response and safety (Aim 3) and ISO10993 biocompatibility testing through biological and chemical
characterization assays (Aim 4). The proposed work provides a foundational data set that will be complemented
with post-Phase II activities to advance towards commercialization.
Innovation: The FRE biomaterial has adaptive properties enabling it to become a low viscosity fluid under high
shear that penetrates and fills the distal vessels supplying the meningioma. As embolization progresses, flow and
shear will continually decrease; in response, the FRE progressively increases in viscosity becoming a viscous paste
for controlled injection. The result is complete casting and occlusion of the entire vasculature. Compared to other
liquid embolics, the FRE is less susceptible to incomplete occlusion because its solidification mechanism occurs

Despite current
pharmacologic therapy and other advances that attenuate remodeling, mortality due to heart failure remains
high. New, more effective therapeutic options are desperately needed in an increasing patient population to
improve both the survival and quality of life for patients with or susceptible to heart failure. Muscle A-kinase
anchoring protein β (mAKAPβ) is the organizer of multimolecular signaling complexes critical for the induction
and progression of pathological cardiac remodeling. By binding a diverse set of signaling molecules, mAKAPβ
dynamically orchestrates multiple signaling modules that transduce cAMP, mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK), Ca2+, phosphoinositide, and hypoxic stress signals. Accordingly, cardiomyocyte-specific mAKAPβ
knock-out in mice inhibited remodeling and the development heart failure in multiple models of cardiovascular
disease. CRI is a company developing novel, patent protected therapeutics for the prevention and/or treatment
of heart failure. In this Fast-Tract SBIR, CRI will test a new gene therapy vector designed to inhibit mAKAPβ
expression selectively in the cardiac myocyte by RNA interference. The AAV9sc.shmAKAP biologic is a self-
complementary, cardiotropic, serotype 9 adeno-associated virus (AAV9) that expresses an mAKAP-specific
small hairpin RNA (shRNA) under the control of a cardiac myocyte-specific promoter. In this application, CRI will
test the new biologic in a clinically relevant large animal model for post-myocardial infarction (MI) heart failure.
Phase I - Specific Aim: We will perform a dose response curve for the biologic in Yorkshire swine to determine
the minimum dose required for consistent inhibition of mAKAPβ expression in the heart. Phase II - Specific Aim
1: Efficacy of mAKAP RNAi for heart failure in a large animal model. The core of this project is to test
whether mAKAPβ RNAi will mitigate pathological remodeling induced by MI in swine, preventing heart failure.
Swine will be subjected to ischemia-reperfusion to induce MI or sham procedure and then treated with the
AAV9sc.shmAKAP biologic by intracoronary infusion immediately after or 1 month later at the dose determined
in Phase I. The pigs will be followed by serial echocardiography and studied at endpoint 3 months post-MI by
catheterization for left ventricular pressure-volume loop hemodynamics. The goal for this Aim is the
demonstration that mAKAP RNAi will preserve cardiac structure and function in a large animal model of MI
disease. Specific Aim 2: AAV9sc.shmAKAP-mediated inhibition of the molecular and cellular pathology
associated with heart failure. Taking advantage of tissue collected from the same animals used in Aim 1, the
benefits of mAKAP RNAi in swine will be demonstrated by gravimetric, histological, and molecular analyses for
fibrosis and other markers of cardiac remodeling and heart failure. In addition, initial toxicology screens will be
done to support the biologic’s safety. This project will show that mAKAPβ targeting is a viable therapeutic strategy
for heart failure post-MI and justify a first-in-human clinical trial for heart failure.",  ,,,,FEDERICO  CIVIDINI,,(619) 534-7946,fcividini@cribiotech.com,,  ,

Aura is a digital health platform that uses Epilog™, a miniature, wireless, wearable EEG sensor worn on the
scalp below hairline that can record clinical and subclinical seizures. After an initial diagnosis of epilepsy, an
epileptologist will use known information about patients’ seizures to guide the best scalp location to place the
Epilog EEG sensor (A). EEG data is continuously transferred (B) to the Aura app on a person’s smartphone (C)
using secure BluetoothTM where it communicates over WiFi (D) to the Aura cloud platform (E). Epilog EEG is
analyzed for seizures and a daily digital seizure diary is shared with epileptologists (F) and pushed back to the
Aura app (G). Epilog is recharged daily, and reusable for a year. Epilog is designed to be discreet, allowing for
continuous use in all facets of daily life.
Data are a 10 s snippet of the beginning of a focal seizure with motor impairment and intact awareness (ILAE
1A1) recorded from Epitel’s single-channel Epilog sensor placed on the left forehead. The patient was admitted
for video-EEG monitoring as standard-of-care. This seizure was verified independently by three epileptologists.
In Phase I, automated, machine learning-based seizure detection algorithms will be designed to first work in the
Aura cloud to detect seizures in Epilog EEG, including seizures a person may not consciously know they are
having (rt50% of all seizures), such as while sleeping. Aura will run these algorithms developed exclusively for
Epilog’s single-channel of EEG to provide a daily digital seizure diary.
In Phase II, the Aura system will enter clinical validation trials for FDA clearance as an EEG-based automated
home seizure detection and alerting system. Early in Phase II Aura will be commercialized as a medical
device-enabled-service business model. Out-of-pocket costs for a person living with epilepsy is an average of
$380/year. Armed with long-term, reproducible EEG, epileptologists will now have a more precise, quantitative
record of seizure counts, enabling them to adapt patient treatment more rapidly and successfully to improve
quality of life. Aura will give people living with epilepsy their lives back. Aura provides certainty where you are
and when you need it. Throughout Phase II, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors
will be combined in the Aura app to collect 27,000 days of multi-modal data from 300 patients to create an
unprecedented dataset of features known to precipitate seizures.
These data will be used in Phase III to create a robust, wearable seizure forecasting system using artificial
intelligence that combines multi-modal seizure precipitating factors, creating an hourly seizure probability.
Aura will profoundly disrupt how epilepsy is managed and improve the quality of life of people living with epilepsy.",  ,,,,MARK J LEHMKUHLE,,(734) 646-6266,lehmkuhle@epite.com,,  ,

It is being developed as a cloud-based application designed to integrate with existing software packages and to provide easy-to-read heatmaps available within minutes. Epilepsy centers and other settings where EEG diagnostics are used will benefit from improved accuracy in diagnosing epilepsy: Currently the accuracy is estimated at less than 60%, whereas the proposed tool can improve this figure by over 25%, more accurately distinguishing between epileptic and non-epileptic pathologies from EEG alone. Furthermore, the technology will increase the speed of epilepsy diagnosis: Currently, patients often require multiple EEGs, during which they are at high risk of further seizures. The proposed tool will provide a definitive diagnostic on the first visit. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves performing a retrospective study to validate a novel EEG analytics tool on 60 or more patients, developing an algorithm to automate artifact removal from scalp EEG data most appropriate for this clinical application, and developing the tool as a cloud-based service. These milestones will facilitate clinical adoption and easy integration into the clinical workflow, both of which are necessary for successful commercialization of the innovation. The tool will predict if a brain network is epileptic while a patient is monitored at rest when no seizure occurs. The key strengths are the use of a dynamic network model (DNM) to uncover connections in the brain that only exist in an epilepsy patient during rest. All other FDA proved tools are based on individual EEG channel properties rather than network-based properties. As a result, their utility is limited to identifying abnormal events (e.g., when an EEG spike occurs), potentially vulnerable to artifacts. In addition, the proposed tool is transformative because it captures how nodes in a network dynamically influence each other, while clinical approaches rely on reading EEG with naked eyes.

Most women undergo menopause, a complex biobehavioral life stage that spans one-third of their life, frequently accompanied by a complex array of symptoms affecting their health, quality of life, relationships, and productivity. The most common and disruptive menopause symptoms are hot flashes, affecting 80% of women, and persisting for up to 10-20 years, with an average duration of 7 years. Unfortunately, there is a lack of adequate support for menopause symptom management, with very few physicians receiving adequate training in menopausal care and unable to provide appropriate care. Importantly, no current solution exists on the market to automatically measure hot flashes and other menopause symptoms over time, a critical limitation in tracking and managing women’s health, and supporting wellness across this challenging life stage.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic, recurring condition that affects approximately 6.4 million
American adults each year. GAD is one of the most common anxiety disorders and is costly to treat, with medical
costs that are 33% higher than other anxiety disorders. Recent weekly GAD-2 surveys by the U.S. Census
Bureau have indicated that the prevalence of GAD may be sharply increasing as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic. As of July 2020, 36% of American adults have symptoms of GAD vs. 8% before the pandemic. Taken
together, there is a need for a comprehensive therapy to effectively treat GAD. First-line treatments for GAD
include medication (e.g. SSRIs, SNRIs), cognitive behavioral therapy, or both in combination. Unfortunately,
these all have shown modest long-term remission rates of only 20-50%. Medications also have common,
undesirable side effects that limit acceptability to patients. Benzodiazepines (BZs) are the most effective
medication for treating GAD. However, guidelines recommend only prescribing BZs for short-term use due to
the potential to develop tolerance and dependence. Neuromodulation investigations via repetitive transcranial
magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have recently shown great promise for treating GAD, with responder rates of 64-
100% in short-term studies. However, rTMS is expensive ($6,000-$12,000 for a 20-30 treatment course) and
requires daily visits to the clinic, limiting the potential for widespread adoption. Recent preclinical and clinical
studies have also shown that acupuncture-based nerve stimulation can be effective for treating anxiety, but it
has the key limitation that treatment must be administered by an acupuncturist in the clinic or at home. To build
on this work and address the need for a comprehensive therapy for GAD, TheraNova has developed the
Empower Neuromodulation System, a portable, non-invasive transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
(TENS), or transcutaneous electroacupuncture, device for non-invasive stimulation of peripheral nerves. The
Empower Neuromodulation System consists of standard, inexpensive TENS gel electrodes and a small, battery-
powered signal generator. The goal of this proposal is to conduct a pilot clinical study to evaluate the potential
of Empower as a treatment for GAD. We will conduct a 6-week, sham-controlled study in 30 participants with
GAD. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to the active or sham treatment and self-administer treatment at home
for the duration of the study. In this single study, we will evaluate metrics of feasibility (Specific Aim 1) and
acceptability (Specific Aim 2). After demonstrating feasibility in Phase I, we will conduct a long-term pivotal
clinical trial in Phase II to evaluate the effect of the Empower therapy on GAD remission. This pivotal study will
support FDA clearance, enabling commercialization after Phase II.Narrative
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic, recurring condition that affects 2.9% (~6.4 million) of American
adults each year. First-line treatments for GAD (including medications and cognitive behavioral therapy) provide

The proposed project focuses on creating a bariatric mannequin simulator to educate healthcare students on
proper techniques specific and specialized to bariatric patient care. Significance: Obesity is one of the world’s
most significant and growing health problems. More than 2 in 3 adults are overweight or have obesity and
obese patients have a greater likelihood of requiring clinical intervention than those who are not overweight. As
such, healthcare professionals must be prepared to care for bariatric patients. Unfortunately, only a few
bariatric mannequins are available in the market today and those that do exist are used primarily for patient
transfer training. Our proposed work is significant and innovative because it addresses the lack of appropriately
proportioned, realistic, and respectful products to train health care providers in proper techniques for bariatric
patient care and does so in an engaging, hands-on manner. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that creation of a
realistic bariatric mannequin system will support enhanced learning interactions and increase knowledge
transfer for clinical education in addressing the care of obese and overweight patients. In the Phase I effort a
prototype system was successfully developed and analyzed. The pilot results of the technology demonstrated
a high degree of positivity, exceptional enthusiasm, and all Phase I metrics of success were met or exceeded.

Current commercial OLED manufacturing technologies typically require methods that are expensive, energy intensive, and slow. The biggest barrier preventing the transition from thermal evaporation to printable technologies has been a lack of commercially available printable electron transport layers. The adoption of PrETL technology will allow manufacturers to eliminate the thermal evaporation steps and enable fully-printed OLEDs at a fraction of the cost of current devices. This development will spur further penetration of OLEDs throughout the lighting and display market, providing the benefits of improved energy-efficiency, reduced eye-strain, flexible forms, minimal heat production, and lower cost device.

Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has few treatments, and patients have a poor prognosis. Checkpoint
inhibitors (e.g., anti-PD-1 antibodies) represent a promising new therapeutic strategy, and two recent clinical
trials demonstrate that TNBC patients may benefit. However, only a fraction of patients responded indicating that
additional combination therapy with anti-PD-1 is needed. Strand Therapeutics developed a synthetic self-
replicating mRNA (repRNA) for use with anti-PD-1. We achieve tumor-directed expression by encapsulating and
directly injecting the in vitro transcribed repRNA with our fully developed lipid nanoparticle (LNP) into the tumor.
The entire repRNA manufacturing process is done in vitro, giving us advantages over virus-based approaches
that require mammalian cell culture. Once in the tumor microenvironment (TME), the repRNAs express a potent
engineered form of the interleukin 12 (IL-12) fusion protein (IL-12-lumican) to stimulate the anti-tumor activity of
NK cells and CD8 T cells in TNBC lesions. The IL-12-lumican fusion protein reduces the risk of systemic toxicity
and enhanced activity by retaining IL-12 within the TME via a collagen-binding domain (lumican). In addition,
repRNA expression and replication have advantages over the short expression duration of modified RNA
(modRNA), and repRNA stimulates various pattern recognition receptors such as TLRs, RIG-I, and MDA-5 to
upregulate type-I interferon. Furthermore, Strand Therapeutics’ proprietary LNP not only efficiently delivers
mRNA to cells but also uniquely synergizes with the repRNA to induce oncolytic effects (immunogenic cell death).
These additional inflammatory cues facilitate turning a “cold” TME to one that will respond to anti-PD-1 therapy.
In this proposal, we will determine whether tumoral injection of repRNA IL-12-lumican can effectively overcome
insufficient immune activation in the TME and augment responses to anti-PD-1 therapy in TNBC. In Aim 1 we
will demonstrate that in TNBC cells repRNAs have more sustained transgene expression and greater type I IFN
induction than modRNAs. In Aim 2 we will demonstrate that repRNAs in human cell line-derived xenograft (CDX)
and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) have greater sustained expression than modRNAs. In Aim 3 we will
demonstrate efficacy and superiority of repRNA IL-12-lumican over modRNA IL-12-lumican treatment (in
combination with anti-PD-1) in vivo in syngeneic mouse models of TNBC and ex vivo in primary explants from
TNBC patients. These studies will provide proof of concept data that Strand Therapeutics’ approach using self-
replicating mRNA encoding IL-12 in combination with PD-1 antibody blockade is effective at reducing TNBC
tumor volume.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Strand Therapeutics is developing a novel and exciting new replicating RNA (repRNA) therapy for triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC). Lipid nanoparticles deliver repRNAs directly to the tumor microenvironment (TME) which
sustainably express cytokines to increase TME immunogenicity and ultimately, the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy.",  ,,,,TASUKU  KITADA,,(202) 596-9690,tasuku.kitada@strandtx.com,,  ,

The goal for this project is to implement fast and reliable mechanisms for: (1) mapping spatio-temporal data of the physical world into structural network representations; (2) leverage the data from these network representations to generate a suitable set of equations that explain the underlying dynamics; (3) use advanced optimization techniques to find a list of models that capture the best combination of network and equations matching the observed data; and (4) orchestrate all these pieces into a single artificial intelligence platform that automatically consolidates data and human interactions for model building and visualization. Efforts in Phase I are particularly focused on demonstrating that the resulting models are physically sound and sufficiently robust for describing the dynamics of fluid transport and diffusion based on different amounts of available data and conditions.

APIs are the way that machines communicate with each other, where these machines may be servers, docker containers, IoT devices, sensors, and more. Enterprises are moving to using hybrid cloud deployments, mixing public cloud with private and edge networks. Further, enterprises are deploying a wide range of open architectures that support mobile access, automated deployment workflows, and application architectures like microservices, IoT enclaves, and sensor networks. Increasingly as an enterprise turns to APIs to stitch these diverse network elements together, API security is a critical element of any enterprise’s cybersecurity strategy. The company’s proposed API security platform leverages a private and permissioned distributed ledger network (DLN) at the heart of its product. In fact, this DLN enables provision of the first implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for APIs. To meet the scale and latency requirements of API authentication in real-time without sacrificing security guarantees, the proposed DLN must be highly performant and efficient in both storage and processing. This SBIR-funded research seeks to advance DLN technology but is also more broadly applicable to the advancement of enterprise applications of distributed ledgers that would benefit from pruning, flexible scaling and orchestration, and heightened performance. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to advance this foundational blockchain framework by discovering and evaluating approaches to elevate performance of the DLN in the scope of authentication application. The project will measure and compare the effectiveness of potential advancements to the DLN platform, including: 1) Horizontal scaling of the blockchain network, i.e. varying the number of peers or other components in the network, 2). Pruning of the blockchain to only keep relevant and necessary portions of ledger data, i.e. leading to a more efficient ledger access without sacrificing deep verification. The research work will extend modeling and simulation infrastructure to pattern and measure real-world, at-scale scenarios. The research proposed here will have a broad impact to DLT research and serve as a blueprint for production-grade ledger-based technologies to help enable use-cases where the barrier to entry is cost, performance, and/or scalability. The company will utilize these research findings to develop a production-grade model for a performant, scalable DLT-based security product that can meet scenarios as expansive as high-performance cloud computing, and as granular as embedded, industrial control systems and sensor networks.

IVT identification requires an inordinate amount of nurses’ time and confers an immense cognitive burden as it requires manual tracing of the line from pump to patient. The errors associated with manual IVT tracing are costly, contributing to increased ICU length of stay and hospital liability. The current pandemic has exacerbated these issues as ICU admissions are rising and the use of enhanced isolation requiring extended IVT. Successful completion of the proposed program will support the development of an extended illuminated IVT that allows for reliable identification of IVT from pump to patient through the use of a fiber optic cable that nurses can turn on and off as needed when identifying lines.

Significance: Ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy is currently the most common surgical treatment for urinary
stones—a painful disease affecting 1 in 11 people and imposing a significant burden on the U.S.
healthcare system, with the cost of care exceeding $10 billion annually. Although laser lithotripsy breaks
all types of stones, an emergent concern is that a large fraction of patients (around one in two) is left
with residual stone fragments when evaluated with computed tomography that are too small to laser
efficiently but too large to pass spontaneously with urine flow. While the residual fragments are small in
comparison with the pre-treatment stone, the residual fragments nonetheless lead to high rates of post-
operative emergency department visits, additional interventions, and recurrence of stones.
Preliminary studies suggest that specially engineered microbubbles augment laser lithotripsy, producing
smaller residual fragments, which should lead to improved clinical outcomes. We hypothesize that
engineered microbubbles augment laser lithotripsy by focusing energy into stones and stone fragments
via two main mechanisms: optical and mechanical. This is consistent with the mechanisms by which
conventional laser lithotripsy ablates urinary stones, via direct laser light interactions with the stone
surface as well as mechanical effects due to the rapid vaporization and subsequent violent collapse of
the aqueous environment concomitant with each laser pulse.
The objective of this Phase I SBIR is to determine the feasibility of using specially engineered
microbubbles to significantly reduce residual stone fragments and improve laser lithotripsy. In Aim 1,
we will identify mechanisms and sites of action of engineered microbubbles in laser lithotripsy. In Aim 2,
we will develop strategies to improve the effectiveness of laser lithotripsy with engineered microbubbles.
The innovation of the proposed approach is the use of engineered microbubbles that accumulate on
urinary stones to augment stone fragmentation and reduce residual stone fragments in laser lithotripsy.
This approach has the potential to significantly improve the treatment for urinary stones by reducing the
risk of injury, procedural complications, and additional procedures, as well as result in a significant
reduction in procedural time and cost. In addition, the knowledge gained from this feasibility study will
aid our understanding of the mechanisms by which conventional laser lithotripsy operates, and produce
further insights into the treatment of biomineralization-related diseases.Public Health Relevance
Urinary stones afflict millions of Americans every year and are associated not only with severe pain, but
also with high treatment costs and potentially life-threatening complications. Currently, the most
common treatment for urinary stones involves a minimally invasive ureteroscopic laser procedure that
intends to break urinary stones into sufficiently small fragments to allow them to pass naturally out of
the urinary system. This project aims at improving the laser procedure by using engineered
microbubbles that will further reduce the residual stone fragment size—an innovative way to pulverize
stones into easily passed fragments.",  ,,,,YURI A PISHCHALNIKOV,,(415) 912-9669,yuri.pishchalnikov@applaudmedical.com,,  ,

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates as many as 55,000 schools and 800,000 government and non-government buildings may have been constructed with PCB-laden paints, caulks, mastics and adhesives before the 1979 PCBs ban. Simply removing the PCB-laden source in hopes it will eliminate the hazard has proven futile as a growing body of data is revealing PCBs from weathered caulk can leach as deep as 6-inches into adjacent porous masonry (e.g., concrete, brick, and mortar). Currently, total demolition and select removal (i.e., partial demolition) are the only EPA-approved PCB removal options and both are quickly filling up the handful of landfills willing to take it. The proposed technical innovation will transform a dormant government patent that extracts PCBs in paint, into a non-destructive treatment method that penetrates and extracts PCBs absorbed in building masonry. Such an innovation will have a direct and beneficial impact on the government agencies and school renovation commissions who cannot afford to demolish the old and rebuild new. This SBIR Phase 1 project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of two proprietary solvent-paste formulations at extracting PCBs from different masonry types after the source (e.g., caulk) has been removed. The solvent-paste is applied directly to the contaminated masonry surface and scraped off after a pre-determined treatment period. Once applied, the lipophilic alcohol in the solvent-paste penetrates the masonry’s open pore spaces, and solubilizes the PCB molecules it encounters along the way. The process of desorbing the PCBs from the inorganic masonry particles and into the applied paste is aided – via capillary action – by the lipophilic alcohol drawing the hydrophobic PCBs toward the paste. Technical challenges include desorbing the stickier spectrum of hydrophobic Aroclors (e.g., 1248, 1254, 1260) added to paints, caulks and adhesives in seasonally cool (< 50°F), wet weather. Since successful commercialization of an alternative PCB treatment technology requires approval from EPA in accordance with the PCB regulations (40 CFR 761), the performance of both solvent-pastes will be evaluated against the regulation’s stringent 1 ppm high occupancy cleanup criterion.

There are excellent protocols for the management and treatment of acute stroke, however, these protocols are only effective once patients have been admitted into the healthcare system. Ischemic stroke affects 700,000 Americans, costs approximately $33 billion annually, and is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US. Health care providers, however, have limited interaction with their patients, and these interactions occur in the highly constrained environment of the clinical setting. Physicians have limited control over patient behavior and limited tools to help patients recognize stroke symptoms outside the clinical setting. For patients with high stroke risk, there is currently no system available to monitor stroke symptoms and initiate a response in real-time. Thus, there is a need to monitor patients remotely, where the current systems for stroke response fail to provide coverage. The proposed solution will expand the provision of stroke symptom monitoring to the daily lives of patients. Tracking patients as they go through their daily lives will considerably enrich our knowledge of stroke and will allow extension to monitoring for other neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders and diseases. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the real-time detection of stroke. IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been an FDA approved therapy since 1995, yet only 5-10% of eligible patients receive this therapy. Arrival time in the emergency room after initial stroke symptoms is directly associated with better outcomes after tPA and endovascular therapy, with a time window of 4.5 hours and 24 hours for these treatments, respectively. Despite massive public health campaigns, identifying symptoms of stroke and activating emergency response systems remains a major challenge. The goal of this project is to develop and test a wearable and computational solution to effectively alert ischemic stroke victims and initiate emergency response in a timely manner. The solution consists of a cloud-based analysis system for real-time detection of stroke onset, enabled by body-worn sensors and a mobile app. Once deployed, the device is expected to dramatically improve stroke emergency response and increase the number of patients arriving in the hospital in time for IV tPA treatment and other reperfusion therapies.

medical training, there is a significant lack of realism. Thus, they do not effectively provoke a
realistic emotional response in trainees. This significantly limits their educational value to the
emergency medical service (EMS) training agencies, as does – in the case of mannequins – their
cost, reliance on electricity, and lack of portability. To address these significant limitations of the
current medical patient simulators, the PI has developed PerSimTM, a patient simulator using
augmented reality (AR) and currently a product offered by the PI's company. However, additional
research and development in is needed to effectively support HAZMAT training scenarios. To
further increase realism and utility for HAZMAT, the PIs have identified the following needs:
1)Define skin injury over specific body locations, which currently are only full body and 2)the
movement of exposed casualties , through decontamination and stabilization. Commercial Need:
Based on interviews with individuals at training agencies within EMS agencies, HAZMAT training
scenarios would be of significant value. Since being released in 4th quarter 2017, there are more
than 25 sites that have purchased multiple PerSim® systems for ~$20-30K each and are using
the systems for EMS training, each effectively training over 100 trainees per year. Moreover, the
PI has a joint marketing agreement with Microsoft, which boosts the company’s marketing efforts.
Preliminary Data: The PI has developed PerSim® an AR-based patient simulator. Via the
Microsoft HoloLens 2 AR display, the system projects high-resolution, realistic animations of a
patient onto any surface a trainee chooses, such as low-fidelity mannequin as a physical
reference for haptic input during procedures. The instructor uses a handheld tablet as both a
controller for the simulation and an automated assessment system to track trainee performance.
The system utilizes another tablet to act as a ventilator, IV Pump, defibrillator and a physiologic
monitor to provide real-time vital sign and heart rhythm data. The system’s control interfaces, and
registration algorithms are patented. Specific Aims: This project proposes to expand upon
HAZMAT content developed in SBIR Phase I in the PI's innovative AR-based patient simulator,
PerSim®. Specific Aim 1: Increase the customizability of HAZMAT burn and skin exposure
scenarios for PerSim®; Specific Aim 2: Develop HAZMAT zones for scene control training in
PerSim®; Specific Aim 3: Develop evacuation of non-ambulatory virtual patients in PerSim®;
Specific Aim 4: Evaluation of Realism and Usability of PerSim® HAZMAT through user studies

The objective of our program is to develop a safe and effective nonopioid analgesic for the treatment of
neuropathic pain, such as pain associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, that targets an
isoform of the voltage-gated sodium ion channel, NaV1.7. Voltage-gated sodium channels are involved in the
transmission of nociceptive signals from their site of origin in the peripheral terminals of DRG neurons to the
synaptic terminals in the dorsal horn. Ten mammalian isoforms exist, NaV1.1–1.9 and NaX. NaV1.7 is the
most abundant tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channel in small diameter myelinated and unmyelinated
afferents, where it has been shown to modulate excitability and set the threshold for action potentials. Humans
lacking functional NaV1.7 due to a rare genetic condition are unable to experience almost all types of pain.
Efforts to develop systemic inhibitors of NaV1.7 have been complicated by the challenge of achieving
selectivity over other NaV isoforms expressed in the diaphragm, phrenic nerve, heart and central nervous
system that are critical for safety. SiteOne Therapeutics has discovered a series of potent, state-independent
NaV1.7 inhibitors that exhibit andgt;1000-fold selectivity over other human isoforms. Work conducted under this
program will support advancement of a lead candidate into clinical development as a therapeutic for
neuropathic pain.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a common side effect of drugs used for the treatment of
cancer. Symptoms include severe pain and sensitivity that can last for months or years after the completion of
treatment, and often lead to dose reductions or discontinuation. As a result, many patients receive suboptimal
cancer therapy. Our program aims to develop an effective, nonopioid therapeutic for pain associated with
chemotherapy-induced neuropathy with no potential for abuse or addition. If successful, the product could also
find use in the treatment of other chronic severe pain conditions.",  ,,,,JOHN V MULCAHY,,(607) 351-6082,john.mulcahy@site1therapeutics.com,,  ,

MARSI occurs in 7% of all patients across all age groups and all healthcare settings, resulting in about 1.5 million injuries annually in United States alone. It is estimated that in 2012 about $850 million in payments to hospitals were withheld due to low patient satisfaction scores because of MARSI. The average tape-induced skin injury costs $88.50 to treat, which is 125x greater than the average cost of one roll of medical adhesive tape. This project aims to create photo-switchable adhesive dressings, which would significantly reduce MARSI, reducing overall healthcare costs through nurse efficiencies, accelerating healing, improving quality of life for patients, and decreasing use of opioid pain medications. Other industry sectors that have shown interest in photo-switchable adhesives include plastic bottle recycling, industrial sensors and productivity sensor solutions and flexible electronics manufacturing. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project presents a novel adhesive technology platform where adhesive characteristics during application and use can be decoupled from end of life / removal characteristics through photo-switching. This project differs drastically from other research endeavors to create dismantlable adhesives, which have drawbacks including high costs, difficulty or inability to scale, insufficient safety to use in the medical industry, and inability to effect stimuli response within a short time. The proposed material meets all adhesive performance specifications and takes 2.5 minutes to photo-switch. Several crosslinker mixtures and emulsion morphologies will be explored to reduce adhesion switch time, in agreement with specifications needed for broad use. The cost and amounts of crosslinkers needed, along with process control complexity, will be studied to optimize for both switching speed and cost to manufacturing. Prototype medical dressings will be prepared by coating medical grade facestock and will be characterized and tested to optimize performance. Finally, the product will be sent for ISO 10993 tests to prove the pre-clinical safety and efficacy of the dressings on an open wound.

Due to increasing power requirements of new systems (such as fast charging technology for electric vehicles), there is a constant need for energy efficient, low noise power conversion electronics compared to the available Silicon based semiconductors. This need opens the avenue for Wide band bap material-based semiconductors, such as GaN, SiC, AlGaN and Ga2O3. Manufacturers have designed various power conversion solutions in the operating voltage range from 600 to 1600V using SiC and GaN; however, there are no products commercially available for operating voltages beyond 1600V, which is why Gallium Oxide Semiconductors offer a promising solution. Ga2O3 falls under UWBGS category, due to the larger bandgap (~4.8 eV) compare to SiC (3.3 eV) and GaN (3.4 eV), and offer better radiation resistance since a higher energy level is required to break their molecular bonds. Ga2O3 semiconductors can operate with several kilovolts and exhibit higher stability and robustness, and therefore is suitable for High voltage, High Power, Medium Power, Low Power applications.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is an often long-lasting neurological condition that arises
frequently in cancer patients who receive broadly used chemotherapies such as taxanes. CIPN causes abnormal
pain and other symptoms that can limit chemotherapy dosage and significantly impact quality of life for years.
There are no drugs that prevent CIPN or treat it well. Duloxetine is the only clinically proven efficacious pain-
reducing agent, though it can cause significant side effects and its efficacy limited to a subset of patients. Opioids
are used off-label, but also carry serious side effects. Thus, there is a critical unmet need for drugs that safely
and effectively treat or prevent CIPN. Peripheral Cannabinoid 2 receptors (CB2) are a promising target for CIPN
treatment. CB2 is constitutively expressed on inflammatory immune cells and induced in peripheral neurons in
neuropathic conditions. Its activation has powerful neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects.
Rodent models of CIPN show that small molecule CB2 agonists alleviate neuropathic pain behavior, and when
administered prophylactically suppress CIPN both during dosing and for 100 days after. Several companies have
developed small molecule CB2 agonists that, unfortunately, are rapidly cleared, penetrate the blood-brain barrier
and/or have off-target effects (notably cognitive ones) mediated by the CB1 receptor. Abalone Bio used its
proprietary Functional Antibody Selection Technology (FAST) to isolate a selective CB2-activating nanobody
(VHH), which we converted into a VHH-Fc fusion lead antibody, ABt140, for in vivo studies. Phase I SBIR results
show that ABt140 rapidly and durably reversed allodynia in mice with CIPN. In this Phase II SBIR project,
Abalone Bio will first improve ABt140’s immunogenicity and manufacturability by rational engineering, and then
the FAST platform will be used to increase its potency to select durable agonists from millions of computationally-
designed variants. We will select 1 lead and at least 2 alternates using in vitro and in vivo assays. Using the
paclitaxel CIPN mouse model, we will assess the lead’s ability to prevent CIPN development, reduce in nerve
damage and inflammation, show no impairment of motor skills, and not affect chemotherapy’s anti-tumor
efficacy. Finally, we will determine the lead antibody’s half-life and tissue distribution in mice, and using blood
markers and organs appearance and weight, we will assess its toxicity at high doses. Successful completion of
these aims will de-risk the project sufficiently to advance Abalone’s antibody drug to IND-enabling studies and
eventually first in human trials for painful CIPN. Abalone’s drug may also have broad utility for other neuropathic
pains and inflammatory conditions.",  ,,,,LAUREN J SCHWIMMER,,(510) 717-9298,lschwimmer@abalonebio.com,,  ,

The costs of renewable energy have declined dramatically, and more than one-third of Americans now live in a community committed to procuring 100% renewable or low-carbon electricity. However, low-cost energy storage is key to achievement of these bold goals and to the growth of clean energy jobs. To meet this need while mitigating dependence on foreign miners of scarce battery materials, hard-to-recycle EV battery waste may be given a “second life” in lower-cost, more sustainable energy storage systems. However, second-life batteries must be safe, reliable, and significantly cheaper than new battery alternatives to gain traction. The cost advantage and performance of second-life batteries hinges on fast and accurate battery testing. Successful development of the proposed rapid used battery testing system would enable widespread deployment of second-life batteries at 30% to 70% lower cost than new battery alternatives. As a result, the innovation has the potential to enhance the reliability, affordability, and sustainability of the nation’s energy system. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to dramatically reduce the time required to accurately measure the state of health (SoH) of used EV batteries. Existing methods either require several hours to fully charge and discharge batteries or highly granular data on historical battery usage. The objective of the proposed research and development effort is to measure the SoH of used EV batteries at any state of charge (SoC) with less than 2% error in less than 75 seconds. The proposed method involves training neural networks to recognize subtle patterns in used batteries’ responses to brief pulses of electric current and ultrasound. The team has collected promising preliminary data, which suggest the test methodology produces highly accurate SoH estimates for batteries at a specific SoC. To maximize the accuracy and robustness of SoH predictions for batteries at any SoC, the team will compare various profiles of electric current and ultrasonic pulses, expand its neural network training datasets, and refine the architecture of its neural networks.

The prevalence of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDROs) or superbugs, which include S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), is one of the greatest threats to public health. Annually in the United States, over 2 million people acquire MDRO infections, leading to at least 23,000 deaths. Further, MDRO infections has been recognized as co-infections of COVID-19 that complicates the therapeutics of the pandemic disease in the healthcare environment. The analyzer will lead to fast containment and rapid diagnosis of MRSA and S. aureus infections. When its capacity is expanded to include other MDROs, the analyzer will allow clinicians to significantly enhanced treatment efficacy, leading to decreased morbidity and mortality, reduced costs of treatment and hospital stay, reduced prevalence of MDROs. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will address the long time-to-result of current MRSA testing technologies. The current culture-based diagnosis of bacterial infections requires 16-48 hours to produce results. The long diagnosis-time leads to overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics (BSAs), resulting in under-treatment, severe side effects, morbidity and mortality as well as the development of MDROs.

Neurokine Therapeutics (NKT) has a unique phase 2 ready clinical asset, MW01-18-150SRM (= MW150), that represents a paradigm shift from the field’s dominant focus on amyloid pathway targeted therapeutic candidates. MW150 has a unique portfolio of target recognition and engagement, preclinical and clinical safety, and orally bioavailable drug exposure. The portfolio provides rational explanations for some of the off-target effects, adverse pharmacology, and clinical challenges encountered with prior art in the same therapeutic class, only one of which exhibited brain exposure.
Therefore, NKT seeks to rapidly fill a key gap for clinical development and future commercialization through leveraging of the NIA SBIR program. Even with covid-19 pandemic delays, NKT anticipates an exceptional phase 2a ready portfolio before the potential start date of a Fast Track SBIR investment by NIA. MW150 development was based on the perspective that Alzheimer’s and related diseases are disorders of progressive synaptic dysfunction with a common neuroinflammation component. Therefore, our novel approach to disease modifying therapeutic intervention was to target pathophysiology progression pathways, with the neuroinflammation-synaptic dysfunction axis being an underlying element across multiple diseases. The activity of the druggable serine/threonine protein kinase, p38alphaMAPK is increased in both neurons and glia, raising the potential for efficacy through a novel pleiotropic pharmacological mechanism in which a single molecular target drug is modulated in distinct cellular pathophysiology processes. Our specific aims are: Aim 1, Generate, qualify and transfer to the Columbia University (CU) site drug product and placebo capsules.
Commercial scale drug substance is on hand, GMP drug product batch processes are established and CU has an experienced and qualified Research Pharmacy; Aim 2A, Prepare, recruit, and conduct a phase 2a clinical study of MW150. We will study 24 Alzheimer’s patients, randomized to once daily administration of test article (MW150: 42 and 84 mg) or placebo (3:1 ratio); Aim 2B. Evaluate safety and pharmacokinetics and monitor response biomarkers. Key milestones for SBIR part I deal with delivery of sufficient validated drug product to the clinical site research pharmacy. Key milestones for part II deal with clinical treatment and evaluations of safety and PK. Outcomes will fill a critical gap in MW150’s commercial and clinical development portfolio as well as provide a firm foundation required for follow-on phase 2b studies in Alzheimer’s Disease.

full criteria for opioid use disorder (OUD). Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) like buprenorphine are
currently the most effective form of intervention for OUD. In spite of the proven efficacy of MOUD, nearly half of
people who begin a MOUD relapse within six months. As such, novel and efficacious behavioral adjuncts to
MOUD are needed to improve treatment outcomes. Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE), a
cognitive-affective training intervention generated through a NIDA-funded treatment development process has
shown significant promise, demonstrating therapeutic effects in four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by
reducing opioid use and misuse and modulating neurophysiological responses during drug cue-reactivity and
natural reward processing. However, the MORE intervention requires significant human interaction and is
therefore resource intensive. Further, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, people with OUD may be reticent to
engage in face-to-face interventions due to the risk of viral spread. To overcome these implementation barriers
and increase access to treatment, the proposed project will develop and test a virtual reality version of the
MORE intervention (MORE-VR) built on BehaVR LLCandapos;s VR existing, commercially available platform, the
Dynamic eXperience Engine (DXE). The DXE uses machine learning to integrate biometrics into the VR
experience to personalize addictions treatment, boosting patient engagement and optimizing the efficacy of
clinical intervention. In Phase I, we will develop and test the MORE-VR prototype in a single arm clinical study
of OUD patients receiving buprenorphine in an opioid treatment program (OTP), focusing on patient safety and
engagement. If the prototype is perceived to have adequate usability and Net Promoter Scores, as well as to
produce improvements in proximal measures of craving and affective state, the project will progress to Phase
II. In Phase II, we will first develop the MORE-VR Minimal Viable Program using feedback from our Phase I
study to optimize the intervention, and then conduct a RCT of MORE-VR vs. MOUD treatment as usual. Our
robust and unbiased research design will triangulate clinical outcome measurement with biochemical
verification of abstinence, ecological momentary assessments (EMA), and neurophysiological assessment of
cue-reactivity. Further, we will integrate the MORE-VR Program into the OTP operational environment, building
Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources interfaces to ingest patient data from electronic medical records
(EMRs) and to export patient utilization, assessment, and biometric data back to EMRs to create patient
records and inform clinicians of patient progress. Activities in Phase I and Phase II will help define the
regulatory pathway and establish regulatory feasibility to precede Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approval of the MORE-VR system as a Class II medical device. In sum, this project will translate an evidence-
based biobehavioral treatment approach into an innovative digital therapeutic for OUD.Project Narrative
Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) like buprenorphine are currently the most
effective form of intervention for opioid use disorder (OUD); however, novel behavioral
adjuncts are needed to remediate dysregulation in brain reward systems, enhance MOUD
adherence, and prevent relapse. BehaVR, LLC will meet this need by translating an
evidence-based biobehavioral treatment approach into an innovative digital therapeutic

This alloy is drawn into wires and fabricated into a weld tape for placement between the materials to be bonded. Utilizing fast and energy-efficient induction heating through alternating magnetic fields, once the Smart Susceptor reaches its Curie temperature, the metal alloy becomes non-magnetic and induction heating stops. Only light pressure (10 psi) is needed to comingle the melted resin and form the weld.Controlled heating can be set for any length of time and cool-down or tempering profiles can be created to control the microstructure of the thermoplastic resin.

Humans are constantly exposed to a variety of chemicals via food, household products, medicines, and the
environment. The kidney is particularly susceptible to chemical damage; drug-induced nephrotoxicity is a major
health concern that contributes to 25% of all cases of severe acute kidney failure. Nephrotoxicity is also a
significant problem in drug development; it is a major cause of attrition late in the process, accounting for 19%
of failed Phase III clinical trials. The limitations of state-of-the-art animal models and in vitro tools for predicting
human nephrotoxicity are well acknowledged, which has sparked the development of advanced 3D in vitro
models of human tissues and organs, so called organ-on-chip systems (OOC) or microphysiological systems
(MPS). While progress with human-based MPS has been rapid, a translational gap remains between MPS data
and in vivo data. Therefore, comparing observations from animal-based MPS to in vivo animal data will inform
our ability to translate human MPS findings to clinical medicine.
This fast-track grant application proposes the development of kidney proximal tubule (KPT) MPS from two animal
species that are frequently used in kidney toxicity screening: rat and dog. Once successfully developed,
validated, and commercialized, the KPT-MPS will serve as an important new tool in chemical toxicity screening
and drug development, allowing cross-referencing animal-based MPS data with in vivo animal data, human-
based MPS data and clinical outcomes. It also has the potential to replace some animal testing, significantly
reducing the use of live animals in preclinical testing.
Phase I of the project is designed to establish robust KPT-MPS models from rat and dog. The project will leverage
the commercially available Nortis MPS platform and pre-established protocols for creating human based KPT-
MPS. Phase I/AIM 1 will demonstrate that proximal tubule cells from rat and dog form viable and structurally
complete proximal tubules and that these tubules exhibit a stress response when exposed to compounds that
are toxic to KPTs in vivo (Phase I/AIM 2). Feasibility requirements will be established in at least one of the two
species before the project progresses into Phase II. Phase II will focus on optimizing the rat and or dog KPT-
MPS prototypes and on developing assays for testing potentially nephrotoxic compounds (Phase II/AIM 1). For
these efforts we will leverage a new microfluidic chip made of an injection-molded thermoplastic material that
was developed for a human-based KPT-MPS. During Phase II/AIM 2, a panel of five compounds with published
species-specific nephrotoxicity for rat, dog, and human will be tested in the KPT-MPS with the goal to establish
correlation between KPT-MPS data and in vivo data in all three species. Phase II/AIM 3 is to demonstrate that
rat/dog KPT-MPSs can be shipped to future customers as a plug and play pre-seeded product.",  ,,,,THOMAS  NEUMANN,,(206) 245-4193,neumann@nortisbio.com,,  ,

long-term lunar and Martian outposts. The physical characteristics of
regolith on the lunar surface, along with its lack of an atmosphere and low
gravity make the fine particles a hazard for equipment and operations on the
moon. Mars presents similar hazards with its low-pressure atmosphere and
reduced gravity. Regolith ejected from landers upon landing or taking off
represent the highest risk due to the high exhaust velocities.
To mitigate high-velocity regolith from being ejected into adjacent areas,
landing and launch pads require surface stabilization. Due to the large mass
required and high payload costs, methods that incorporate ISRU have the
potential to present a lower-cost and more efficient option for planetary
construction.
Past work by PISCES, in conjunction with NASA SwampWorks and Honeybee
robotics, has focused on sintering basalt without binders. This method has
proven successful, but the high energy and the need for consumable high-
temperature molds would incur substantial energy and payload costs.
Recent work done by PISCES evaluated the use of a binder in an aqueous
solution that eliminates the problem of high energy input required for the
process. The use of this binder has allowed for a reduction of the sintering
temperature of the basalt, but most importantly, it cures into a structurally
viable material under a vacuum and in CO 2 . This can be a game changer that
allows for the regolith binder mix to be used in additive construction
operations without the need for additional heat or consumable molds.
This proposal leverages Masten Space Systemsrsquo; work on the effects of PSI on
surface erosion with their hot plume sample interaction testing and PISCESrsquo;

Aerial nozzles that are used for application ofcrop protection materials to the ground are usually chosen for their ability to produce coarserdroplets with the smallest possible volume fraction of droplets below 150 microns. This is oftencalled the ""driftable fraction"". Since most nozzles were originally designed for use in low-speedterrestrial based applications their external design and how it interacts aerodynamically with airflowing around it was generally irrelevant or even optimized for use with no or low speedflowing over it. In aerial spray applications especially at high speeds the aerodynamicconditions around the nozzles represent much higher forces and as such can significantly impactthe performance of the nozzles. Surprisingly to date there has been no effort to redesign andoptimize these nozzles to streamline and optimize the flow of air over their exterior surfaces. It isa well-known phenomena that any fluid (air being a fluid) passing over a sharp edge or transitionwill create turbulent eddies on the lee side of the edge. At high enough velocities such as thosefound in aerial spray application the energy contained in these eddies can be of enoughmagnitude to contribute to irregular droplet formation in the spray jet leading to an increase indriftable fraction.Phase I of this project will use Computational Flow Dynamics software in conjunction withprinciples of aerodynamic flow to modify the exterior surfaces of existing straight stream and flatfan nozzle designs and the hardware designed to hold them. It will then show in high speed windtunnel air conditions such as those experienced during spray application that the driftablefraction can indeed be reduced by incorporating designs that smoothly meld the transitionsbetween surfaces and carefully managing the airflow as it interacts with the spray jet. In Phase IIthis will be refined further in a wider range of operational conditions again using ComputationalFluid Dynamics (CFD) software to simulate and optimize the designs before final in-situ aerialtesting and creation of the final product. The ultimate product of this project will be a nozzlesystem that improves aerial applicators' ability to manage drift risk in aerial applications withlower drift in a broader range of weather conditions while still maintaining an efficacious spraydroplet spectrum.",  ,,,,Mark  Ledebuhr,,(517) 202-6839,mark@applicationinsightllc.com,,  ,

Most RF Fingerprinting techniques work by identifying small variations in a transmitted signal that are introduced by hardware components (capacitors, inductors, etc) of the transmitter within the non-linear regions of operation. Neural Networks provide a way to identify these small variations which can act as a “fingerprint” for the specific RF emitter. Photonic Neural Networks provide an efficient, high bandwidth, low latency method of implementing certain Neural Network Topologies. Other topologies, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are better implemented in the electrical domain. A Hybrid (photonic + electrical) solution is proposed for RF Fingerprinting. Achieving stand-off distances for RF Fingerprinting requires the ability to process signals with a low Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). We propose an RF Noise Cancelling Frontend to our design that could be implemented with a Microwave Photonic Canceller (MPC). We anticipate that this proposed architecture will demonstrate the feasibility to accurately fingerprint signals with 5 dB SNR, at 100-550 us latency and with a 5 GHz Bandwidth. The low SNR capability will enable stand-off distance fingerprinting. The low latency will provide a path to real-time identification. And finally, the high bandwidth will allow multiple channels to be assessed simultaneously without any additional hardware – improving Size, Weight and Power (SWaP).",sbir@socom.mil  sbir@socom.mil,,,sbir@socom.mil,Samuel  Subbarao,,(225) 283-2158,sbir@socom.mil,,  ,

Interactive Machine Learning (IML) is a human-centered paradigm in which end-users, e.g. crewmembers and ground-based Subject Matter Experts, iteratively build and refine the ML model through iterative cycles of input and review. Model refinement is driven by user input that may come in many forms, such as onboard data and communications, crew preferences, modified mission parameters along with a description of features and selection of high-level model parameters. IML is distinct from classical machine learning in that human intelligence is applied through iterative teaching and model refinement in a relatively tight loop. With this approach, our goal is to develop an architecture that provides end-users with the ability to interactively explore and adapt the training space with the goal of guiding the adaptation of the cognitive agent toward an intended behavior. This approach will allow crewmembers the ability to control how the cognitive agent learns and adapts during a long duration exploration mission, assuring that its performance improves and does not degrade over time.

The use of multiple excitation wavelengths allows for the detection of many different molecular species (including background contaminants) which would otherwise not all be accessible and/or as distinguishable with a single excitation wavelength.FLARE draws heritage from another flow-through fluorescence instrument developed by LMT which uses a single excitation wavelength (265nm) and six emission bands to detect microbial protein fluorescence. This predecessor has been deployed and tested aboard the VALKYRIE cryobot at the Matanuska Glacier (AK) where it monitored, in real time, microbial cells in the generated melt water at concentrations below 50 cells/mL with good precision. By expanding the number of excitation wavelengths and significantly increasing the number of detection channels to 16 or even 32, FLARE will be able to excite a much larger number of compounds and be better equipped to spectroscopically distinguish between them. This will allow FLARE to detect cells (e.g., via proteins) and, by measuring the fluorescence from tell-tale fluorophores such as NAD(P)H (which only fluoresces in a reduced state) and siderophores (e.g., pyoverdin), inform as to the metabolic activity or possible pathogenicity of the microbes.Since FLARE is a continuously-monitoring flow-through system, it can detect larger eukaryotic cells such as protists and fungi at very low levels (lt;lt; 1 cell/mL).

State-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) data science applications require significant resources to run computationally intensive algorithms and models. To facilitate intensive data analysis in a resource constrained environment such as space, we need to utilize resources efficiently and at scale. Current solutions to this problem require downlinking full datasets to perform ground-based processing or running low computational footprint algorithms that are less effective than state-of-the-art solutions. In this proposal, we explore the capabilities and benefits of developing MAGE (ML Accelerated Grid Environment). MAGE is a software framework and API that facilitates ML training and inference distributed across a networked constellation or swarm of satellites to enable resource intensive ML models to run at the extreme edge. This solution makes complex data processing at the edge possible by running on AI accelerated hardware and distributing ML processing and storage across a grid of compute and storage nodes. Collectively, these nodes comprise a grid computing environment that can be tasked by spacecraft to run resource intensive applications. MAGE reduces the need to downlink full data sets, allows prioritization of data downlinking, enables proliferation of complex autonomous space-based systems, and provides a mission agnostic environment for processing and storage.

The use of newer ablative TPS materials in the high-enthalpy flow result in complex processes such as decomposition of products, surface ablation, and spallation. Optical measurement techniques that can size and track particles in the flow would be of value for validation of facility operation and refinement of numerical models. Unfortunately, optical measurements of particles in an arc jet are challenging due to the strong emission from the test article and reacting flow which can saturate the camera. ISSI proposes employing an optical measurement technique known as Particle Shadow Velocimetry (PSV) that has been used to measure particle size, velocity, and acceleration a solid rocket motor at rates of over 10-kHz. PSV is accomplished by projecting light from an LED through the measurement volume onto a camera which allows the shadows created by the particles to be recorded. The individual particle shadow can be sized or tracked in time to compute particle velocity, acceleration, or trajectory. Utilizing an LED-based PSV system for measurements of the size and trajectory of spallation particles in an arc jet offers several unique advantages. First, the combination of a relatively narrow wavelength LED and a matching narrow-band filter on the imaging system can be used to suppress the broadband emission from the flow. This allows acquisition of distinct particle images, even in the presence of strong emission from the reacting flow. Second, the in-line illumination that is required for PSV measurements allows particles to be imaged very close to surfaces, within 50-mm of the ablating TPS surface. PSV is a high TRL tool that has already been demonstrated for acquiring particle size and trajectory measurements in a high enthalpy flow.

The machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities of MITA would be able to make predictions and capture/analyze data in a manner more efficient than ever before while decreasing the overall energy consumption. MITA functions as an RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) base to test and analyze the existing launch systems, including those currently implemented at NASA. The RTU delivers and receives information from the system as a multipurpose device for remote monitoring and control of various automation systems. MITA seeks to improve the control of in-flight test conditions, expand measurement and analysis methodologies and improve test data acquisition and management. MITA can detect issues in real-time and has the capability to present solutions or work to resolve the problem.",NASA SBIR  Support Office,,(301) 937-0888,sbir@reisystems.com,Tuan  Le,,(407) 766-6677,tuan.le@lengineer.com,,  ,

Rx Bandz proposes to explore the addition of an energy-absorbing polymer jacket to the exterior of the cartridge surface, augmenting its strength and destroying defective units in production. Rx Bandz will design, develop, and test Type I 1mL cartridges reinforced with a perfluoroalkoxy (PFA), fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP), or silicon jacket. These materials were considered for their shrink recovery, energy absorption and ease to integrate into a medical device. Assembly of the sheath over the cartridge will take advantage of the shrink recovery of the proposed elastomers by first expanding the sheath and then allowing it to recover around the cartridge. The compression of the recovered elastomer on the foot and shoulder of the cartridge permanently secures the sleeve. During assembly of the sheath, the elimination of critical defects resulting from upstream manufacturing processes is also considered. Destroying unidentified defective cartridges by exposing them to forces defined by the shrinking sheath will prevent failure during operation. This approach not only increases ruggedness and reliability, but also benefits from the low-cost and low-risk provided by maintaining a standard Type I pharmaceutical glass as the primary container. Rx Bandz’ solution does not change properties of the glass or expose the pharmaceutical to new materials, which allows for leveraging existing data to demonstrate compliance with ISO 11608-1, ISO 13926, ISO 70788, and USP 661 (protection, delamination, chemical composition, compatibility, clarity, quality, etc). This low-risk design’s success in increasing ruggedness by using energy absorption to protect brittle materials against impact and vibration is well documented. Energy absorption protects the glass from cracks and scratches that would increase criticality and weaken strength. Strength property of glass is not constant, but rather defined by its surface quality arising from the defect disturbances. Eliminating and preventing these defects are essential to mitigate the risk of a cartridge fracturing during use. A protection system of this type increases the ruggedness and reliability of the cartridge during the lifetime of the auto-injector.",Teresa  Bowens,,(301) 619-2446,teresa.m.ferrara-bowens.civ@mail.mil,Stephen  Harhen,,(617) 827-6253,Stephen@RxBandz.com,,  ,

The state-of-art methods result in non-optimized and over-rated systems where the power density is compromised. Through our deep understanding of high-frequency power circuit components and advanced circuit layout design practices, we propose a novel all-passive, isolated, lossless, non-invasive, single current sensing solution for reliable operation and protection of WBG power electronics converters. Each of these characteristics adds significant benefits. An all-passive sensor requires no active processing or saturable circuitry (and their response time is only limited by how fast electrons can move). Therefore, it can be well suited for detecting fast-changing currents seen during fault conditions. A lossless sensor does not compromise the (conversion) efficiency and thermal management of its system. An isolated sensor simplifies the circuitry should be routed to the main controller.nbsp;A non-invasive sensor does not affect an optimized circuit layout of the converter. Finally, a single-sensor solution is desirable in terms of costs and, more importantly complexity of the system.

NMIPACS is highly relevant to Subtopic A3.01 because it addresses a key ATM challenge related to improving efficiency for the near-future (2025-2030) NAS. A FAA-NASA-Industry SWIFT working group identified the lack of an early TBFM delay impact prediction capability as a top priority because it prevents the FAA and flight operators from collaboratively negotiating TBFM program parameters. This results in avoidable and inequitably distributed TBFM delays. To solve this problem NMIPACS develops the following innovative microservices (and the associated digital assets): (1) A TBFM SWIM Data Interpreter to parse the existing TBFM scheduling configuration, parameters, and scheduling times; (2) An ML-based Prediction Engine for predicting Estimated Times of Arrival (ETAs) at TBFM scheduling points (a key digital asset); (3) A TBFM Scheduling Emulation that applies the TBFM scheduling steps to the scheduling data, and computes an accurate estimate of the TBFM Scheduled Times of Arrival (STAs) and the per-flight delay impact of those STAs (another digital asset). We make the TBFM Scheduling Emulation flexible so that it can compute STAs for multiple user-specified TBFM parameter choices. This enables NMIPACS to operate in a real-time what-if analysis mode so that the FAA and airlines can use it to collaboratively evaluate strategies for managing TBFM delays or distributing them more equitably among flights. In Phase II, we expand NMIPACS to address multiple other applications that address TFMS-TBFM interaction issues, among other things.

EMP is an instantaneous energy field set off by a high altitude nuclear explosion enabled by missile flight or from a satellite. A widespread EMP effect could lead to possible long-term disruption of the nationrsquo;s critical communication, transportation, and military infrastructure. NASA and US military in-space assets are also vulnerable to the effects of EMP. The current state of the art to protect against an attack is with massive shielding such as a Faraday Cage, concrete structures, and buried cables.

Development of these coatings will be grounded in fundamental physics using an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based deep generative design framework that is capable of evaluating novel materials on various substrates. The primary focus of this proposal is to provide shielding capability optimized using simulation, fabrication, and testing for 1) mitigating deleterious damage to hardware from both, EMP and the harsh space radiation environment, 2) increased bond strength between coating and substrates 3) improved durability for long term space applications as will be demonstrated on NASArsquo;s MISSE platforms, and 4) light weight, low cost and ease of manufacturability.

Our goal is to develop a novel, immunologically enhanced L. lactis probiotic-based therapeutic for the
treatment of Sjögren’s Syndrome (SjS). SjS is a progressive, chronic autoimmune disease characterized by
inflammatory cell infiltration of the salivary and lacrimal glands, resulting in acinar epithelial cell atrophy, cell
death, and loss of exocrine function 1-6. At least half of SjS patients develop extraglandular inflammatory
disease and have a wide range of systemic clinical manifestations that can affect any organ system, including
connective tissue, and 5-10% of patients develop life-threatening lymphoma 7, 8. SjS is a debilitating disease
affecting as many as 3.1 million individuals in the U.S. 9, 10, with women being nine times more likely to be
afflicted with SjS than men 5, 10, 11.
Treatment of SjS remains a significant unmet medical need. Current treatment relies on replacement therapies
such as artificial saliva and eye lubricants or immunosuppressive agents12, 13. Because of the multiple antigens
involved in this disease process, i.e., α-fodrin 14-17, ribonuclear protein Ro/SSA 14, 48, 49, La/SSB 14, 48, 49, and
M3R 18, 49, 50, oral tolerance methods become problematic. Thus, the capacity to stimulate regulatory cells
independent of knowing the antigen specificity for the disease poses as an attractive therapeutic approach.
Originally conceived as a human diarrheal vaccine, we found that colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) from
human enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) is effective at inducing auto-Ag-specific T regulatory cells when
administered orally as either a purified protein or delivered via a Salmonella or L. lactis bacterial delivery
system 19-21, 61. To avoid challenges associated with producing large quantities of CFA/I protein and improve the
mucosal pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of CFA/I following oral administration,
we developed and characterized a vector-containing L. lactis-CFA/I expressing product (referred to as VTC-
CFA) and evaluated its efficacy in multiple autoimmune models. Indeed, VTC-CFA was effective at reducing
clinical symptoms in a SjS animal model, along with experimental models of RA, diabetes, and MS 22-24. Prior
Phase I and II SBIR funding has enabled us to effectively advance VTC-CFA towards clinical testing by
developing our clinical candidate that expresses CFA/I from a genome-integrated operon, validating non-
clinical biology, and completing upstream and downstream process development. As part of these efforts, we
held an FDA pre-IND meeting to finalize our IND-enabling plans and align our CMC/manufacturing strategy.
This application is designed to complete VTC-CFA IND enabling studies and file an IND with the FDA. The key
aims of this proposal are: 1) complete VTC-CFA GLP toxicology studies, 2) establish cGMP manufacturing
infrastructure, 3) perform cGMP manufacturing for drug substance, 4) Fill capsules under cGMP conditions for
drug product, and 5) file an IND with the FDA for VTC-CFA.
Successful commercialization of VTC-CFA will provide a profound medical advancement for treating SjS.",  ,,,,GARY  FANGER,,(443) 248-2796,gfanger@risetherapeutics.com,,  ,

Once an experiment or production is terminated, REALISE is designed to be serviced on-orbit while the crew is present for consumable swap out so that the unit can initiate another autonomous operation cycle. Potential applications are radiation studies over multiple generations to characterize the response of organisms or the effectiveness of countermeasures for future long-term human spaceflights as well as cell production facilities for unique terrestrial cell culture treatments that can only be grown in the space environment.nbsp;",NASA SBIR  Support Office,,(301) 937-0888,sbir@reisystems.com,Tobias  Niederwieser,,(720) 557-9396,toni9434@colorado.edu,Regents of the University of Colorado,  ,() -

by the yearly vaccine program. The severity of this problem is likely to increase with emergence of new influenza
virus strains in the human population, and this situation is made even more complex by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Both COVID-19 and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemics are reminders of the challenge posed by emergent
viruses, and they also highlight weaknesses in global preparedness should additional threats arise. Despite
existing seasonal vaccines and two classes of chemical pharmaceuticals in current use, there is an urgent need
for new anti-influenza therapeutic agents to provide broader coverage, ensure against emergence of drug
resistance and prepare for future inevitable pandemics. This Phase I STTR application is to develop potent
inhibitors to a novel viral target, the nucleoprotein NP. We have identified and characterized two inhibitor classes,
with promising affinity and potency, lack of cytotoxicity and good PK properties. The goals of Phase I are to
demonstrate in vivo efficacy in the mouse model, select and characterize escape mutants in cell culture, and
further explore one of our series with excellent opportunities for additional medicinal chemistry. Included in this
effort is the important goal of creating broad-spectrum antivirals that are active against H1N1 and H3N2 seasonal
strains – which is achievable given the highly conserved nature of the NP target. Our approach is divided among
three, integrated Specific Aims. In Aim 1 the BALB/c mouse infection model will be used for efficacy studies of
leads JJNP9-4 and MC-2, based on successful MTD and PK studies in the mouse. Several parameters will be
measured as indicators of efficacy, including mortality, body weight, viral load in the lung and other standard
behavioral and physical parameters. In Aim 2, JJNP9-4 and MC-2 will be used for selection of virus escape
mutants, followed by sequencing of the mutants, reverse genetic construction of drug-resistant variants, and
characterization of viral fitness of the escape mutants. The results will inform future structural studies to identify
the binding sites of the inhibitors. In Aim 3 the potency of one inhibitor series will be addressed by developing
an SAR with the synthesis of individual analogs and combinatorial libraries Two top-prioritized analogs will be
used for MTD, PK and efficacy studies in the mouse model of infection.Project Narrative

Defecatory disorders such as chronic constipation (CC) and fecal incontinence (FI) affect 25% of the population
and the incidence is rising. These disorders pose a major health care burden and are poorly recognized and
treated. The need for better diagnostics and therapeutics is substantial. CC, a symptom of underlying defecatory
disease, affects 12-19% of Americans with expenditure on laxatives being nearly $1B yearly. Another defecatory
disorder is FI, which affects 10% of the population and its incidence is rising. Approximately 15% of the population
in USA over 70 years of age as well as 10% of those under 70 suffer from FI. It is an under-diagnosed problem
due to patients often being too embarrassed to seek medical help. The mechanisms of defecation and continence
depend on colorectal motility, stool consistency, rectal capacity and compliance, anorectal sensitivity, and
coordination of the pelvic floor muscles and sphincter. Management options for these patients are limited due to
the multifactorial control of defecation and continence; and the difficulties in identifying the exact cause of CC
and FI with current diagnostics. Precise diagnosis is necessary to judge if the patient is eligible for biofeedback
treatment. 3DTs multimodal Fecobionics device is a novel, anorectal natural orifice insertable device that
provides high resolution pressures, orientation, bending, and shape during defecation of the device. It simulates
feces and electronically measures relevant parameters of defecation such as the propulsive force, anal sphincter
relaxation, and anorectal angle. Results from previous studies have shown safe and distinctive recordings of
important anorectal function parameters. Specifically, the device did not cause tissue injury to rectum or the anal
canal as verified by visual inspection of mucosa and histological examination. Fecobionics evacuations in non-
GLP pig studies showed characteristic pressure profiles and orientation/bending data obtained with wired as well
as wireless transmission. Furthermore, simultaneous data from human studies outside of the US have provided
the first-in-man studies with the initial wired prototypes of Fecobionics. The human studies have confirmed that
the device is safe and easy-to-use in the clinical setting with integration of most current tests in one, and high
degree of agreement with key parameters obtained with the balloon expulsion test and defecography. Distinct
differences were found, however, when compared to the manometry “gold standard” as there are also difference
between current clinical tests. To advance these outstanding findings and to move closer to commercialization
of Fecobionics, this Fast track proposal intends to accomplish the following: Phase I Aim 1: Modification of filling
tube detachment. We will develop an optimized, easy-to-operate tube with needed retention force and
detachment. Phase II Specific Aims: 1) GLP studies in swine to demonstrate safety, 2) In vivo comparison of
anorectal angle and pressure measurements, and 3) 510(k) submission. To obtain data for submission of 510(k)
for market release of wireless technology. The long-term goal is to develop the technology for biofeedback training
by patients in their homes with remote assistance by practitioners to substantially reduce healthcare costs.NARRATIVE
Up to 25% of the adult population suffer from anorectal symptoms that are difficult to diagnose, classify and
determine the cause of dysfunction. The purpose of this Fast Track proposal is to submit a 510(k) application to
obtain regulatory approval for electronic feces device that enables high-tech bionics measurements during
defecation.",  ,,,,WILLIAM  COMBS,,(317) 278-2268,wicombs@iupui.edu,,  ,

year with a 14% overall mortality rate, despite the availability of drugs that are active against MRSA. In addition,
a significant number of invasive diseases with treatment failure and mortality can occur as a result of methicillin-
sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) infection in critically ill and immunosuppressed patients. S. aureus is the leading
cause of prosthetic joint infections (PJI). Remarkably, infection rates following total joint arthroplasty (TJA) and
trauma surgery have remained largely unchanged over the last 50 years. Treatment failure rate for PJIs caused
by S. aureus is as high as 38%. Reinfection rates from MRSA are very high (15-40%), and often require a two-
stage exchange arthroplasty. Treatment failure rates as high as 33-59% and mortality rates of 7%-24% have
been reported after two-stage revision surgery. Thus, given the growing burden and the severity of disease and
the high rate of treatment failure after antibiotics treatment, alternatives like adjunct immunotherapies that can
increase the treatment success are urgently needed. We have demonstrated a key role for N-
acetylglucosaminidase (Gmd), a key enzyme in binary fission during S. aureus cellular division, during the
infection-mediated invasion of the bone, a critical step in osteomyelitis. We developed a potent anti-Gmd
neutralizing monoclonal antibody, TPH-101, and demonstrated the efficacy of this fully human antibody in a
murine model of implant-induced S. aureus osteomyelitis as well as its adjunct efficacy in a revision surgery
model of implant-associated S. aureus infection in combination with vancomycin. Having already established
the proof of concept in relevant animal models, under this Direct to Phase II SBIR application, we will complete
rigorous safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in sophisticated murine and rabbit models of implant-
associated osteomyelitis, complete cell line and process development, hold a pre-IND meeting with FDA, and
complete the IND-enabling safety and pharmacokinetic studies. The proposal has fours Specific Aims. In Aim
1 we will remove any potential sequence liabilities and test the antibody in a rabbit model of orthopedic implant-
associated infection. In Aim 2 we will develop bioanalytical methods for release, potency, PK, and stability, and
conduct preliminary dose translation studies. A stable CHO cell line will be developed in Aim 3 for high yield
manufacturing. In Aim 4, a scalable manufacturing process will be developed, a toxicology lot produced, and a
pre-IND meeting will be held with FDA to seek feedback on pre-clinical and clinical safety plans. The toxicology

The hydrogen embrittlement problems endemic to industries that require heavy use of hydrogen have been solved in various ways. Most of these solutions involve the careful development of alloys that are less susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. Unfortunately, these alloys often require a sacrifice of some other highly desired material property, such as strength, hardness, ductility, etc. Coatings have also been attempted. However, these coatings and coating techniques have their own drawbacks, which include ceramic coatings that flake off after only a few use cycles and coating techniques that cannot deposit onto a finished part because they require line of sight during deposition. To better mitigate the very pressing hydrogen embrittlement challenge, Summit Information Solutions, Inc. proposes the use of a mature deposition technique that has not seen much use outside of the microelectronics industry.

Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) is a Gram-negative bacterium that commonly colonizes the human pharyngeal
mucosa, but can also cause invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), a devastating disease that presents as
septicemia and meningitis. More than 70,000 cases of IMD are reported annually worldwide with case fatality
ratios between 5% and 15%. Bactericidal anti-Nm antibodies may prevent infection and colonization and can be
identified by the serum bactericidal assay (SBA), which is the gold standard in vitro surrogate of protection.
Vaccination that results in protective bactericidal IgG is, therefore, considered a crucial control measure
for IMD. A “Reverse Vaccinology” approach that starts with in silico prediction of vaccine antigens has led to
licensed protein-based vaccines such as the multicomponent 4CMenB (Bexsero®). However, all licensed anti-
Nm vaccines have limited breadth of coverage, leaving vaccinees susceptible to IMD caused by non-vaccine
type strains. There is an urgent need for continued discovery of vaccine candidates that will provide full coverage,
either individually or in synergy with existing vaccines. We hypothesize that the next generation of Reverse
Vaccinology (“RV 2.0”), whereby SBA-active human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) are generated from
convalescent IMD patients, will provide the platform for discovery of vaccine antigens against Nm. The team of
Prof. Paul Langford and Dr. Fadil Bidmos of Imperial College London have generated novel broadly protective
bactericidal hmAbs from convalescing patients. The current challenge with RV 2.0 is identifying the cognate
antigens of bactericidal hmAbs. Antigen Discovery, Inc. (ADI) of Irvine, CA has established panproteome
microarray technology for identification of the protein targets of antibodies associated with protective immunity.
A proteome-scale platform for profiling antibody specificity has never before been available to the Nm
research community, and this technology has the power to rapidly advance discovery of vaccine
candidates. This project aims to identify the antigens targeted by bactericidal antibodies. A Neisseria
meningitidis panproteome microarray will be developed for use in an RV 2.0 approach to screen hmAbs and
convalescent sera from pediatric IMD patients characterized as having SBA and other in vitro functional antibody
activity, such as complement activation, opsonophagocytosis and adhesion inhibition. The most promising
antigens will be validated by producing and purifying recombinant proteins, which will be used to develop
Luminex assays for confirmation in orthologous immunoassays. At least 5 vaccine candidate antigens that bind
antibodies that recognize diverse Nm strains, are broadly immunogenic in the target population and are not
currently included in any licensed vaccine will be taken forward for preclinical development in a Phase 2 SBIR
application. This grant application addresses the significant problem of IMD in children and adults by laying the
foundation for a broad-coverage vaccine through identification of the protein targets of bactericidal antibodies.",  ,,,,JOSEPH J CAMPO,,(949) 679-4068,jcampo@antigendiscovery.com,,  ,

We propose a product for supply chain risk management and provenance of binary applications. It shall process binary applications and the libraries they use, shall generate similarity graphs and reports of libraries. Our technical approach is based on a binary similarities analysis between pairs of functions, using a graph database. First of all, we split the binary to analyze into individual functions, and then calculate, in an optimized way, a similarity index between pairs of the functions in the binary and functions we already have in the graph database, from previous analysis.The similarity indices are stored the database, and as result we now can calculate full software provenance graphs of the analyzed binaries and libraries, including version history graphs of the individual libraries.

In an effort to resolve the critical problem of communication delays to and from Earth and provide the crew with the support they need to carry out their mission, nFlux proposes an autonomous cognitive agent built from the capabilities of Sigma to assist astronauts during deep space missions.

However MRI signals are weak due to the small difference in energy levels population of parallel and anti-parallel spins (~6ppm at 1.5T) that contribute to the signal. Clinical MRI exams demand high resolution and/or fast scanning. Since SNR is the main limitation on fulfilling these requirements, it is the most important parameter of MRI systems.  MRI SNR can be increased by signal averaging at the expense of lengthy scan times. Pursuit of higher SNR on one hand has resulted in a shift toward the use of higher static magnetic fields which is expensive and has siting and safety issues. On the other hand, we are rapidly approaching limitations in MRI systems with greater number of receiver channels.  We propose novel innovations to optimize MRI SNR for a given magnet field strength. Generally SNR can be increased by increasing the signal strength or by reducing noise. We propose novel combinations to achieve maximum, near ultimate intrinsic MRI SNR by efficiently accomplishing both. The technology proposed has broad applications within and outside of MRI. A successful project will improve the MR image quality in shorter scan times thereby alleviating burden on high cost, high magnet field based MRI systems.

patented virus-like vesicle (VLV) platform for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The goal
of this project is to complete preclinical studies and product development of the CARG-201
vaccine. We have designed this vector to achieve a functional cure in CHB patients, characterized
by a sustained loss of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (with or without HBsAg antibody
seroconversion), using our VLV-based hepatitis B virus (HBV) therapies. We have developed a
therapeutic vaccine capable of inducing virus-specific CD8+ T cells that clear HBV infection. As
detailed in the progress report (see attached RPRR), we have attained the majority of the Phase
II milestones. Using a VLV dual promoter and a glycoprotein switch, we have enhanced efficacy,
as demonstrated in an adeno-associated virus (AAV) mouse model of persistent HBV. We have
generated CARG-201 harboring both MHBs and HBcAg antigens, which can control HBV
replication, as evidenced by reduced serum HBsAg levels in mice. The reduction in serum
biomarker levels in more than 80% AAV-HBV mice with high antigenemia is highly significant as
it indicates that CARG-201 can break tolerance and drive T-cell responses to HBV antigens. As
this is the first attempt to produce good manufacturing practice (GMP)-grade VLVs, our task is
critically important and requires innovative approaches. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
provided pre-investigational new drug (IND) feedback on CARG-201 in April 2019, and we have
addressed all of their concerns. The FDA agreed with our proposed plan on the animal toxicology
program, GMP manufacturing methods, and quality control testing. The FDA also provided
positive feedback on our clinical study objectives/endpoints and our Phase 1 study design,
including the dosing regimen and patient eligibility criteria. Thus, with the completion of GMP
manufacturing and animal toxicology studies, we are now progressing CARG-201 to clinical
trial(s). To complete the studies required by the FDA for an IND application, we propose the
following specific aims in Phase IIb: Aim 1. Complete safety, non-clinical toxicology, and
pharmacokinetics studies of CARG-201. Aim 2. Conduct product development studies of CARG-
201, including manufacturing process development, scale-up feasibility studies, purification,
analytic assay development, and formulation and stability studies. Aim 3. Initiate GMP
manufacture and release of clinical-grade CARG-201 material and submit an IND application to
support Phase I evaluation. IMPACT: This project addresses the urgent unmet need for a
therapeutic vaccine for CHB, harnessing work previously funded by an NIH SBIR Phase I and II
grant. This project is well positioned to yield sustained and powerful progress towards the
development of an efficacious immunotherapy for CHB.",  ,,,,VALERIAN  NAKAAR,,(203) 606-8796,vnakaar@carogencorp.com,,  ,

researchers will collaborate to develop, formatively test, and evaluate the short-effectiveness of a digital provider
platform, called Memento.HTN, that is integrated with a patient SMS text system, and designed to support medication
adherence by African Americans with hypertension (HTN). HTN is more common and more destructive for African
Americans than for any other ethnic group. More than half of African American adults, about 15 million people, have
HTN. Furthermore, African Americans are 4 times less likely to adhere to HTN medications compared to their white
counterparts. Tailored approaches to reduce the racial gap in HTN morbidity and mortality, particularly those that support
medication adherence, are needed in primary care. Such approaches must overcome barriers due to cost or geographic
distance that can prevent African American patients from accessing adherence support. These approaches must also
overcome barriers to the delivery of adherence support that stem from healthcare systems themselves. Importantly, HTN is
one of most common co-morbidities in Covid19 hospitalizations, particularly for African Americans (CDC 2020).
Moreover, media coverage of a possible link between certain HTN meds, called RAAS inhibitors, and severe Covid19
outcomes may have alarmed HTN patients about the safety of their meds. As a result, the ACC (March, 2020) promptly
issued guidelines recommending all patients adhere to HTN meds during the pandemic unless advised by their physicians,
as there is no evidence of a link between HTN drugs and Covid19 severity. Thus, in the time of Covid19, supporting
medication adherence of African Americans with HTN is extremely urgent. Memento.HTN is innovative in three key
ways: 1) To our knowledge, it is the first-ever linked digital provider platform and patient SMS text system for HTN
medication adherence. 2) It is culturally-tailored for African Americans with HTN. 3) It has unique monitoring
functionality allowing providers to monitor individual patient adherence; support `new start' patients, who are at
increased risk for non-adherence; and track group adherence rates by drug class, pill format, and patient demographics,
which have never been included in any digital med adherence intervention. Thus, the Memento.HTN system greatly
simplifies and facilitates provider delivery of adherence support to patients, while enhancing their clinical therapeutics.
The provider platform sends patients interactive SMS-text pill reminders plus culturally-sensitive motivational,
educational, spiritual/stress-supportive, and customizable texts, along with texts targeting intentional non-adherence and
Covid19-related concerns. Texts go directly to patient cellphones (no mobile app needed), making the intervention
accessible to patients who do not possess smartphones. Importantly, Memento allows 2-way texting communication
between providers and patients, and automatically alerts providers when a patient has a clinically-significant pill lapse. We
believe Memento has significant commercial potential, as EHG has already developed plans for multiple digital
adherence interventions that will be marketed together to clinics serving large numbers of at-risk patients. This B2B
business model can generate large increases in revenues for customers, making our products attractive from both a
financial and health perspective.",  ,,,,PATRICIA F WEITZMAN,,(617) 250-8596,pat.weitzman@gmail.com,,  ,

Prevalence in the United States is as high as 11%, and in a majority of cases the condition is refractory.Compelling evidence supports the hypothesis that chronic cough arises from alterations in sensory
physiology that cause hypersensitivity to previously innocuous stimuli. The voltage-gated sodium ion channel
NaV1.7 is highly expressed in unmyelinated vagal nerve afferents that trigger cough through a sensorimotor
reflex circuit. Results from a published pre-clinical report show that reducing expression of NaV1.7 nearly
abolishes cough evoked by inhaled irritants, indicating that it is a promising target for reducing cough. SiteOne
Therapeutics has discovered potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of NaV1.7 that block vagal C fiber
activity in a dose-dependent manner. During a Phase 1 program, our team demonstrated that systemic
administration of an isoform-selective NaV1.7 inhibitor abolishes the cough response to inhaled irritants in
conscious guinea pigs. The objective of our Phase 2 program is evaluate safety, pharmacokinetic and efficacy
endpoints, and to advance an inhaled NaV1.7 inhibitor into IND-enabling development as a therapeutic for chronic
cough.",  ,,,,JOHN C HUNTER,,(908) 247-4340,john.hunter@site1therapeutics.com,,  ,

During this program, Electronic BioSciences, Inc. (EBS) will develop and demonstrate a complete, end-to-end,
universal methodology for repeat sequence characterization, including precise length and methylation (5-
methylcytosine or 5mC) assessments. This technology will be enabled by the development and demonstration
of a sequence-targeted sample and library preparation that will enable the isolation and enrichment of any repeat
sequence with a known sequential context or loci for disease-specific diagnostics. Specifically, satellite DNA is
comprised of sequence repeats that occur in tandem 5 or more times. Among this DNA, microsatellites have a
1–10 nucleotide (nt) repeat pattern and minisatellites have a andgt;10-nt long repeat pattern. A specific type of satellite
DNA found in coding regions of the genome are repeat expansions. Increases in repeat sequence length and
epigenetic 5mC status have been correlated to a number of diseases, including Myotonic Dystrophy,
Huntington’s Disease, Friedreich’s Ataxia, Fragile X, Fragile XE, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or ALS, etc., and
the targeted characterization of these regions would represent a direct approach (relative to whole genome
sequencing) towards clinical and point-of-care diagnostics. However, there is no technology presently available
that is ideally suited for characterizing these repeat sequences as a result of read length (associated with next
generation sequencing approaches) or accuracy (associated with third generation sequencing approaches),
which has significantly limited the understanding of the role repeat sequences have in disease states, their
diagnostic/prognostic utility, and the development of associated assays. During this Phase I SBIR program, EBS
will develop and demonstrate a technology that will allow these regions to be efficiently assessed for disease
state diagnostics.Project Narrative
This program will develop and demonstrate the feasibility for a complete end-to-end system for targeted repeat
sequence characterization, capable of precisely quantifying the repeat length and epigenetic (5mC) status. The
proposed approach will implement direct, electronic, nanopore-based, single-molecule, strand sequencing
methodology for precision analyses that are not possible with currently available technology. The achievements
made during this program will lay the foundation for the development of a multi-disease panel screening platform
that will efficiently characterize repeat sequences and the associated disease diagnostics/prognostics, ultimately
improving personalized patient care and population health.",  ,,,,ANNA  SCHIBEL,,(801) 428-7300,aschibel@electronicbio.com,,  ,

This advanced QFP device will help propel the US forward as a world leader in quantum technology.  Core capabilities enabled by distributed quantum information processing include not only quantum key distribution, but also critical areas like distributed quantum computing, entanglement-based quantum sensing, and blind quantum computing. All these applications will require quantum networks that can mediate communication and entanglement between physically separated systems. For some of the capabilities outlined above, physical separation is fundamental to the application itself. For example, quantum networks can enable interferometric telescopes with longer baselines and hence finer resolution than possible with classical techniques. In addition, quantum clocks connected over a quantum network could realize global timing with precision beyond the possibilities of isolated systems. In both these cases, the distance between devices is crucial to the application, which makes quantum networks a necessity.  While matter-based qubits are extremely fragile, photons experience virtually no decoherence and are the only realistic choice to carry quantum information over long distances. In recent years there has been progress in facilitating entanglement and communication between end nodes using satellite-based and terrestrial free space optical links. However, for dense and short reach communications, like local area and metropolitan area networks, these modes of communication are unrealistic given the need for line-of-sight links and relatively high optical loss over short distances. The tremendous bandwidth and low loss offered by optical fiber makes it a critical tool for interconnecting a large number of quantum resources for both computing and distributed sensing.  The same advantages of low loss and massive parallelization of communications channels in the spectral domain seen in fiber optic networks will be crucial for scaling up quantum networks. However, much of the previous work in quantum information has utilized photonic degrees of freedom which cannot be easily preserved in standard single-mode fiber. On the other hand, discrete variable frequency encoding provides natural stability in optical fiber, straightforward measurement with high-efficiency filters and detectors, and compatibility with wavelength-division multiplexing. By cascading electro-optic phase modulators (EOMs) and Fourier-transform pulse shapers, any frequency-bin quantum operation can be realized in a theoretically scalable fashion, defining the Quantum Frequency Processor (QFP) needed for implementation of a quantum network.",Jared  Evans,,() -,sttr@afwerx.af.mil,Steven  Estrella,,(805) 967-4900,steven@freedomphotonics.com,Purdue University,Andrew  Weiner,(765) 494-5574

The goal of this project is to commercialize a new steerable microcatheter, the Angler™, which
will significantly improve an interventional radiologist’s ability to navigate across small blood
vessels. Microcatheters are designed to reach small vascular targets from access points such
as the femoral or radial arteries, located up to 150 cm away. Interventional radiologists use
these devices to treat a wide variety of ailments, from a traumatic vessel rupture to a hepatoma.
Access and navigation of small vessels, however, can be difficult in up to 45 % of all cases,
where there is challenging anatomy or when multiple targets are present. Difficulties in
navigation can result in added procedure time, unpredictable scheduling, increased radiation
exposure, and, in time-critical processes such as a ruptured pseudoaneurysm, poorer clinical
outcomes. In cases where navigation is challenging, the interventionalist can switch to
microcatheters, guidewires, or guide catheters with different shapes or stiffness to help with
vessel selection, but at additional cost and time.
We have developed the Angler™ using a novel coaxial design that allows active deflection of
the microcatheter tip, while satisfying the size requirements for general microvascular and
neurovascular procedures and preserving the tracking and torqueing properties of existing
microcatheters. This would greatly enhance the operator’s ability to navigate the vasculature,
and reduce the need to stock and use passive devices with different shapes. The capabilities of
this device have been proven versus existing microcatheters through independent bench testing
and two separate animal studies with interventional radiologists.
Following 510(k) clearance, Agile Devices will perform all FDA required process validations
before commencing human use builds. We will also develop two new line extensions (an 0.027”
I.D. high-flow version and a 0.0165” I.D. neuro version) through design freeze. These will
expand usage of our technology into additional peripheral vascular and cancer applications and
into neurovascular procedures.This project seeks to improve a physician’s ability to perform minimally invasive treatment of
many diseases, from bleeding aneurysms to cancer. We are introducing a new device that will

The eosinophil is a peripheral blood leukocyte containing an abundance of cytoplasmic granules, rich in cationic
protein toxins. Among these, the most abundant on a molar basis is the major basic protein-1, eMBP1. eMBP1
kills helminths, bacteria, and numerous cells, such as respiratory epithelium, but also activates cells, including
basophils and mast cells. Studies of human diseases show that eMBP1 is present in secretions from patients
with eosinophil-mediated diseases, including asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, and gastrointestinal diseases, and
it is deposited on damaged targets. These studies show that the eosinophil mediates its damage to parasites
and tissues by discharging its toxin rich granules onto microbial targets and tissues. eMBP1 is synthesized as
a precursor, pro-eMBP1, composed of eMBP1 and a remarkably acidic pro-piece sequence. Developing
eosinophils synthesize pro-eMBP1, and the pro-piece is removed during granule maturation. Analyses of pro-
piece in different models show that it can neutralize the toxic eMBP1 effect and also the toxicity of the eosinophil
cationic protein (ECP). This project proposes that neutralization of eMBP1 can be a treatment to mitigate tissue
damage in eosinophil-related diseases. It will develop a pro-piece product for treatment of eosinophil-mediated
diseases by neutralization of eMBP1 and other granule toxins. Currently, no therapies for these diseases
address the neutralization of granule proteins.
In this project, the pro-piece will be expressed and associated glycans will be modified to identify the optimal
form of the molecule for binding to and neutralizing eMBP1. These tests will determine whether glycosylation of
pro-piece importantly alters its binding to eMBP1 by analyzing whether N- or O- glycans and the
glycosaminoglycan at S62 modify its activities. The project will identify the most important pro-piece regions for
binding eMBP1 and neutralizing it by creating overlapping peptides and creating mutants with increased amino
acid sequences characteristic of active regions. Evaluation of the pro-piece panel for binding to and inhibiting
eMBP1 will be evaluated here in several in vitro models. The goal of this project is to identify an active form of
the pro-piece with optimal inhibition effects on eMBP1 and other granule toxic proteins. This form will be further
investigated and developed in future projects.",  ,,,,GERALD J GLEICH,,(801) 581-8963,gerald.gleich@hsc.utah.edu,,  ,

Regular application ofpesticides is the traditional solution however increasing resistance regulations and a risingdemand for organic fruit production motivate a need for alternative non-chemical treatmentmethods. USDA ARS scientists developed a treatment methodology called PhylloLux which usesUV-C irradiation array followed by a four-hour dark period (US Patent Application No.2017/0274106 A1 submitted September 28 2017) to manage diseases and pests. Because UV-Cexposure can be harmful to humans and night treatments present scheduling challenges manuallyadministering PhylloLux is impractical. TRIC Robotics LLC has partnered with AFRS in aCRADA agreement (#58-8080-9-003) and seeks to automate the UV-C treatment process describedin PhylloLux for field and commercial applications. We propose the development of anautonomous mobile platform that would enable PhylloLux treatment as a non-chemical alternativeto pesticides. Specifically innovating how UV-C treatment is performed efficiently and effectivelythroughout the field. We envision three primary technical objectives: 1) develop a multi-arraytreatment capability 2) develop a system for accurately controlling UV-C dose and maximizingfield coverage 3) experimentally validate treatment capabilities in open fields. Ultimately the goalis to improve profitability of strawberry production by providing growers with a non-chemicalservice for sustainably controlling pathogens and arthropod pests.,  ,,,,Adam  Stager,,(908) 229-6108,astager@udel.edu,,  ,

They identified hazards, estimated their probabilities and risk mitigations in case a failure occurs. Many of the risks that UAS pose to the air space and ground communities are evolving.We propose to develop engineering models of the 3-D, time-dependent hazard trajectory volume that travels with the UAS in case of a failure.

Project Summary Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the leading cause of viral death in infants and young children, and a major cause of respiratory illness in immune compromised adults and the elderly. Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine or effective therapy available for RSV. Synagis, a monthly intramuscular injection of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) palivizumab, is the only FDA-approved intervention given to a very small subset of high-risk infants as immunoprophylaxis. However, it is not effective at treating RSV. Thus, for the tens of thousands of infants hospitalized for RSV, only supportive therapy is available, and morbidity and mortality are substantial. Interestingly, RSV spreads in the lung via shedding of virus exclusively into the airway; thus, RSV must traverse airway mucus (AM) before infecting neighboring cells, and RSV remains primarily restricted to the airways with little to no systemic viremia. We believe an RSV-specific, safe, effective and topically- delivered antiviral would provide a powerful option addressing the current gap in pharmacological interventions. Mucommune is developing RespiraClear to meet this goal, based on a proprietary “muco- trapping” mAb technology platform with core claims allowed by the USPTO and exclusively licensed from UNC. RespiraClear is a topical mAb treatment based on (i) re-engineering RSV-binding mAb with elevated expression of a fully human Fc glycosylation that enhances its ability to trap RSV in AM and purges the virus from the airways via natural mucociliary clearance mechanisms, and (ii) stably delivering it to the lung airways using a vibrating mesh nebulizer. By concentrating an optimized mAb at the site of infection rather than delivering it systemically, we expect to enable efficacious and cost-effective treatment of RSV, with little risk of adverse side effects due to limited systemic adsorption from pulmonary delivery. Our pilot studies demonstrate that RespiraClear can potently trap RSV in human AM, facilitate rapid elimination of viral particles from the mouse lung airways, and remain stable when nebulized using a vibrating mesh nebulizer. Building off these promising results, we seek to verify in Phase I of this FastTrack proposal that RespiraClear is indeed superior to palivizumab injected intramuscularly in treating RSV infections in cotton rats, to date the most commonly used animal model for RSV infections. If successful, Phase II of the project will focus on accelerating the preclinical development of RespiraClear. This includes generating a stable CHO cell line for high yield production of RespiraClear (Aim 1), partnering with PARI (a leading nebulizer manufacturer) to develop a customized vibrating mesh nebulizer for RespiraClear (Aim 2A), validating its delivery performance in a pediatric lung model (Aim 2B), and finally, evaluating RespiraClear's efficacy in a neonatal lamb model (Aim 3). If successful, the proposed work will greatly accelerate the clinical evaluation of RespiraClear. The work will also help pave the way for improved, molecularly-targeted therapies against a broad spectrum of pathogens across all major mucosal surfaces.",  ,,,,RICHARD  CONE,,(917) 705-3371,cone@jhu.edu,,  ,

Kinematic stimulation coupling is provided by an internal inertial measurement unit (IMU), and a simplified user interface allows an operator to monitor and adjust stimulation parameters such as axial sensitivity and velocity coupling, as well as observing, recording, and exporting of stimulation data. Bidirectional communication between the user interface and the device is afforded by secure wireless communications protocol. The headsetrsquo;s compact, wireless, and self-contained form factor allows it to be used in a wide range of training environments. Additionally, a rechargeable battery permits un-recharged runtimes of 8+ hours.",NASA SBIR  Support Office,,(301) 937-0888,sbir@reisystems.com,J. David  Remer,,(434) 220-9448,remerd@lunainc.com,,  ,

Heart Failure (HF) is a devastating epidemic affecting more than 23 million patients worldwide; in the U.S. alone,
1,000,000 new cases are reported each year. While heart transplantation provides the best treatment option for
many patients, less than 6,000 procedures take place globally each year. Consequently, it is estimated that
50,000 – 100,000 patients could immediately benefit from mechanical circulatory support.
Many circulatory support devices are available for patients who require left ventricular support, but few options
exist for patients who would benefit from biventricular support. With the exception of transplantation, the optimal
approach to biventricular failure is the replacement of the native heart with a Total Artificial Heart (TAH).
Traditional approaches have used volume displacement pumps, which have inherent limitations due to their
large size, flexing membranes, and valves that conspire to reduce the durability and lifetime of the device. The
same limitations were observed throughout the early application of VAD technology, which prompted a transition
to rotary blood pumps for size reduction and increased durability. Today, more than 60,000 patients are
supported with rotary VADs. Capitalizing on the advantages of rotary blood pump technology, the BiVACOR
TAH is small, reliable, blood-friendly and has inherently balanced blood flows.
Under the previous SBIR II, the implantable components of the BiVACOR TAH were significantly improved and
validated on the benchtop and in-vivo. Notable advancements were made in hemocompatibility, physiological
interaction, anatomical fit and reliability. BiVACOR is now entering the final product development and
manufacturing phase and wishes to utilize the SBIR IIB scheme to ready the BiVACOR TAH system for the first
clinical application via an FDA-approved Early Feasibility Study (EFS). In order to achieve this goal, the following
specific aims will be completed: 1) production of a clinical grade TAH system; 2) verification and validation,
including in-vivo studies under a Good Laboratory Practice environment, for regulatory approval; and 3)
submission of regulatory documentation for EFS. The commercial application and viability of this product will be
demonstrated and will encourage additional investment for full commercialization.
The world-wide impact of a commercially viable, long-term mechanical replacement to the failing human heart
will be tremendous. The wait for patients desperately requiring a heart transplant will go from years to off-the-
shelf availability, thereby quickly providing a vastly improved quality of life. Leveraging the successful durability
and small size of similar technologies used for ventricular assistance into the BiVACOR rotary TAH provides a
promising pathway to finally achieve the goal of a reliable, biocompatible, physiological, and ultimately practical
replacement to the failing human heart.",  ,,,,DANIEL  TIMMS,,(832) 701-6569,daniel.timms@bivacor.com,,  ,

With this hierarchical dependency structure, the architecture layers can be thought of as composable libraries that are ready for standardization by the international Modeling amp; Simulation (Mamp;S) community. Any technology layer could be swapped out and replaced with a different (perhaps optimized for a particular hardware/network configuration) implementation developed by any other organization. The plug-and-play composability design strategy of the WarpIV Kernel promotes composability both for (1) technology insertion and (2) composable plug-and-play software models potentially developed by multiple geographically distributed organizations to facilitate collaboration. The software abstractions and overall composability methodology support both arbitrary and mixed levels of fidelity for systems and subsystems hierarchically composed of models.Support for plug-and-play model composability within the WarpIV Kernel simulation engine is essentially complete and could be used by NASA today to support MBSE. However, the set of tools used to (a) construct models and (b) specify their composite structure needs to support MBSE standards such as SysML. The model data, interface, and system-structure metadata that is captured by the WarpIV GUI tools have not yet been translated to SysML format and vice versa, so this step needs to first be evaluated for feasibility and then demonstrated with initial capabilities.

New space vehicles and systems are being developed and tested, and a significant percentage of the structures in these spacecraft will be composite materials. Composites offer high stiffness- and strength-to-weight ratios, but they also exhibit complex damage modes, including voids, delaminations, matrix cracking, fiber breakage, and combinations of all the above. This offers many challenges for ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and structural health monitoring (SHM).A proper understanding of the physics of a given NDE/SHM method is critical for the meaningful characterization and quantitative assessment of structural health. A need therefore exists to fundamentally understand the interaction of interrogative ultrasonic wave energy with the complex fiber/matrix system and damage types in multi-layered composites. To address this issue, a predictive tool with quantitative computational NDE/SHM capabilities is necessary to the success of future space missions.In this project, it is proposed to develop a physics-based software package to model ultrasonic energy interaction with composite damage in both the frequency and time domains. The software package utilizes open source code and a fast and efficient Distributed Point Source Method (DPSM) to solve frequency domain ultrasonic wave fields in multi-layered composite structures with and without damage. The objective of this effort is to expand the DPSM capabilities to obtain time domain sensor responses at any location. Parallel computing capability will be implemented to solve the problem at multiple frequencies such that the time domain signal can be computed at any point on the structure. The wave energy-material modeling software package will be an essential tool to optimize sensor locations and minimize the total number of sensors and weight of future NDE/SHM systems.

Hot structure applications such as blunt body reentry, unpowered atmospheric flight, and powered sustained atmospheric flight at hypersonic speeds are all areas that will benefit from improved material architectures and are key in a multitude of NASA programs. Currently, hot structures are limited to 2900 deg;F for extended operation and many material systems have limited reusability. The aforementioned applications would benefit from improved hot structures that can continuously operate at temperatures above 2900 deg;F and can survive multiple flight cycles. A major barrier to realizing advanced hot structures for hypersonic flight is the development of protective coating materials compatible with carbon/carbon (C/C) substrates. Due to their high specific modulus, high fracture toughness and thermal conductivity, good thermal shock resistance, and excellent high temperature strength, advanced C/C composites are the best choice for hot structures for hypersonic flight. Unfortunately, C/C composites start to rapidly oxidize above 370 deg;C, which restricts their engineering applications in air. Current protective coatings on C/C typically fail at elevated temperatures and/or under repeated cycles due to poor bonding with C/C resulting in poor thermal conductivity between the coating and the C/C substrate. Reactive solution infiltration processing offers a means to produce integrated bond layers that are reactively fused with the C/C substrate. This effort will develop hafnium based reactive solution infiltration to form HfCN bond layers. HfCN offers a high temperature, high conductivity material solution to improve hot structure performance. This bond coat process will offer improvements over state-of-the-art coatings and enable existing high performance topcoat materials to better adhere to C/C facilitating improved reusability of hot structures.",NASA SBIR  Support Office,,(301) 937-0888,sbir@reisystems.com,Tyler  Kaub,,(256) 851-7653,tkaub@plasmapros.com,,  ,

Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome associated with malarial infection.
In 2018, malaria affected more than 213 million people in Africa alone and claimed 381,000 lives,
more than 65% of whom were African children less than 5 years old. As a consequence of the high
incidence of CM, it is often misdiagnosed for other pathologies with similar symptoms, leading
to a high false positive rate for CM, incorrect treatment, and resulting mortality or neurological
disability. The specificity of the current standard of care for clinical diagnosis of CM (physical
symptoms, coma, and malaria parasite test such as rapid diagnostic testing) is reported around
61%. Therefore, there is a significant market need for a highly specific, low-cost, and easy-to-use
test to improve CM diagnosis and save lives. Since Malarial retinopathy (MR) is greater than 95%
specific to the presence of CM, retinal screening for MR represents an effective means to assist in
and improve the specificity of CM diagnosis. Screening for MR in addition to the current standard
of care improves the specificity of CM diagnosis from 61% to 100%.
VisionQuest Biomedical has developed ASPIRE, the first fully automated MR detection software
integrated with a low-cost and portable retinal camera, a system that can be operated by
minimally trained personnel such as medical technician or nurse without the need of an
ophthalmic specialist. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of regulatory consultants,
commercialization experts, business development specialists, and clinicians; to clinically deploy
and launch ASPIRE in our target market in Africa. This team will validate and prepare ASPIRE
for regulatory clearance as well as finalize the marketing and commercial rollout strategy.
In Phase II-B, the research team at VisionQuest Biomedical deployed a fully-functional clinical
version of ASPIRE and tested it in nine malaria clinics in Africa, which demonstrated excellent
performance and usability for detecting MR, without the need of an ophthalmic expert. In CRP,
ASPIRE will be validated for technical and clinical performance and will be brought to
commercial readiness with regulatory clearance. We will accomplish this through four specific
aims. In the first aim, the software system for MR detection will be validated to bring it under
design controls. In the second aim, we will deploy ASPIRE at 25 clinics in Africa to demonstrate
safety and efficacy as well as to promote market traction. The third aim will focus on preparing
ASPIRE for regulatory submission. In the fourth aim, we will complete African healthcare market
research for a startup market of 5 countries (Malawi, Zambia, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda) and
finalize marketing and rollout strategy. Within one year after CRP, our goal will be to deploy
ASPIRE in more than 200 malaria clinics across 5 countries in Africa.",  ,,,,VINAYAK S JOSHI,,(505) 508-1994,vjoshi@visionquest-bio.com,,  ,

There is a critical need for effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that can be rapidly produced at large scale. Given
our rudimentary understanding of the immunological responses to the virus, a vaccine that engenders a
broad-based response (innate, humoral, and cellular), is particularly appealing. Further, with little or no a
priori knowledge of key immunological targets, a vaccine that can present all of a virus’ antigens to the host is
ideal. In response, using its unique computational algorithm, Codagenix has designed and completed initial
pre-clinical testing of an intranasal, live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, CDX-005, that 1) activates innate,
humoral, and cellular immune responses, 2) presents every viral antigen in its natural conformation to the
inoculated host, and 3) will be inexpensive, fast, and easy to produce at scale. This is the only LAV being
developed for the US market. The vaccine grows robustly in fully characterized GMP cells and pre-clinical
data suggest that a single, low, intranasal dose in the range of 104-106 PFU will be protective. Pre-clinical
testing in Syrian Golden hamsters demonstrated the safety, attenuation, and efficacy of CDX-005 in vivo, and a
Phase I clinical trial will be beginning in the UK in 2020 using product manufactured overseas. Our goal is to
produce and distribute the CDX-005 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in the United States. To this end, Codagenix has
had pre-IND communications with and guidance from the FDA. We propose to complete additional pre-
clinical studies in response to FDA recommendations and to develop a formulation that is stable for extended
periods at 4°C to reduce shipping costs, simplify end-user storage, and make it easier to administer the
vaccine. Accordingly, in Aim 1, we will develop a CDX-005 formulation that is stable for extended periods at
2°-8°C. Starting with our frozen formulation as a base, we will test excipients for their ability to stabilize a
liquid vaccine using forced degradation, accelerated stability testing, and long-term stability testing protocols.
In Aim 2, we will determine the toxicity, immunogenicity, biodistribution, attenuation, and efficacy of late
passage CDX-005 in Syrian Golden hamsters. In preparation for an IND filing, we will 1) assess toxicity by
histopathology and hematology after inoculation with CDX-005, 2) examine CDX-005 immunogenicity by
serum IgG ELISA, plaque reduction neutralization, and Th1/Th2 response by qPCR, 3) determine CDX-005
biodistribution and attenuation by qPCR and TCID50 in tissues and excretions, and 4) assess CDX-005 efficacy
by SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In parallel with the proposed work, we will bring CDX-005 manufacturing
capabilities to the US, conduct a Phase I clinical trial in the UK, and sequence the virus from tissues in these
patients to test for possible reversion. We recognize that other SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may reach the market
before CDX-005. While these will be a tremendous boon short term in the fight against SARS-CoV-2, the are
expected to be only partially protective. In contrast, we anticipate that CDX-005, as an LAV, will provide a
much more robust and longer lasting protection making it a more attractive choice in the long term market.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Codagenix will complete pre-clinical testing of a highly immunogenic live-attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,
CDX-005, that presents every viral antigen to the inoculated host. CDX-005 exhibits robust growth and appears
to be effective at a low dose making it easy to rapidly scale US production to meet the county’s critical
immediate vaccine need. Codagenix will also reformulate the vaccine so that it can be stored at 4°C for
extended periods of time making it less expensive to ship, simplifying end-user storage, making it easier to
administer.",  ,,,,STEFFEN  MUELLER,,(516) 567-5888,mueller@codagenix.com,,  ,

The current CLDG systems on the Virginia-class submarines utilize multiple discrete tri-axial (i.e. three-axes) magnetic field (B-field) sensors that measure the localized B-field surrounding the discrete sensors, which are permanently installed in the hull of the ship. The current B-field sensor of choice is a 3-axes Flux Gate Magnetometer. Unfortunately; the system performance of these discrete FGM’s is adversely affected by local anomalies from a multitude of nearby magnetic sources/materials such as: electronic equipment, rotating machinery, structural welds, support beams, etc. The magnetic sensors required for CLDG have many stringent requirements including: high physical and electronic stability, low sensor noise, and high measurement accuracy over a range of temperatures and B-fields that are encountered during shipboard engineering spaces. The overall goal of the proposed Phase II effort is to synergistically combine two types of magnetic measurement systems that are not adversely affected by these local magnetic anomalies so that the correct input can be provided to the CLDG system and hence make the submarine less vulnerable to detection from its magnetic signature. The highly detailed and successful Phase I experimental investigation compared two separate integrated B-field measurement techniques: a) a Flux Gate Magnetometer (FGM) using discrete 3-axes FGM sensors and b) a true continuous Spatially Integrating Magnetometer (SIM). The primary Technical Objectives of the Phase II Base are to improve the B-field measurement sensitivity of the continuous SIM. To accomplish this task, a new digital based SIM version with superior SWaP, will replace the older analog SIM unit. Once the new digital SIM has been fabricated, e2P will synergistically combine the continuous SIM with the discrete FGM sensors using e2P’s proprietary Calibration Techniques. The combined approach will provide an unequaled SIM with superior performance enhancement over the entire dynamic range of operation compared to any competitor. This will result in the desired outcome of providing the correct input to the CLDG system when localized magnetic perturbations are present, thereby reducing the magnetic signature of the ship/submarine.",Donald N Pugsley,Sr. Electronics Engineer,(301) 227-7030,donald.pugsley@navy.mil,Christopher M.

Further, most of these flights are expected to employ electric propulsion vertical takeoff/landing aircraft (eVTOL). While eVTOLs offer many advantages over conventional gasoline fueled aircraft, huge strides are needed in battery or energy storage technologies to enable long duration flights. The immediate implication for this is that airborne eVTOLs may not have large reserves of energy to implement congestion mitigation procedures such as hold patterns. Further, current technology requires many hours to recharge the batteries on these aircraft, which implies that the UAM operators require accurate predictions of available airspace capacity to schedule their operations and manage their fleetrsquo;s energy resources. Given this situation, there is a need for accurate estimation of available capacity and how the prevalent demand can be balanced to take full advantage of this capacity, also known as demand capacity balancing (DCB). From another perspective, accurate DCB estimation offers the opportunity to evaluate which technological and operational enhancements best serve the prevalent and anticipated demand. The concept of DCB has been implemented within the commercial aviation world at some of the busiest airports across the world. However, those DCB approaches do not readily translate for the UAM paradigm. To address these needs and gaps, IAI proposes UAM Demand Capacity Modeling through Ensemble Learning (UDC-ModEL) to accurately and rapidly model DCB at UAM vertiports. As the name suggests, our technology leverages the latest advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence to erect a rapid estimation capability that is agnostic to the UAM marketrsquo;s location or the eVTOL fleet mix used by a UAM operator.

The lunar surface is, and has been, bombarded with a range of micrometeorites that create a relatively fine dust powder on the surface that is easily agitated, has sharp structural edges, and is charged by photons and solar winds. This combination allows for and even generates fine, charged clouds of dust that coat and obscure structures on the lunar surface. This includes the necessary structures for thermal regulation, thermal radiators.Thermal radiator systems are commonly cantilevered panel structures designed to extend beyond a main structure to increase the surface area utilized for the absorbance or emittance of thermal radiative energy. Dust buildup on thermal regulators can greatly decrease thermal performance by simultaneously increasing solar absorptivity by darkening the surface and decreasing effective emissivity by adding a low-conduction layer on top of the surface. To help with dust mitigation on structures like thermal radiators, Paragon proposes a Modal Optimized Vibration dust Eliminator (MOVE) as a low cost solution to NASArsquo;s desire for dust mitigation on the lunar surface.nbsp;The proposed innovation is a two-part lunar dust mitigation solution which utilizes autonomous, active vibration at modal nbsp;frequencies coupled with an anti-static coating to minimize the performance reduction caused by lunar dust accumulation on radiative surfaces and panels.

These measurements can lead to inference of aerosol type with a temporal resolution of minutes.nbsp;The MP2 follows from a history of polar nephelometers that illuminate suspended aerosol particles in a chamber and then measure the scattered light as a function of angle. With the MP2 we intend to modulate polarization at the source and then measure not the intensity but the polarization signal at the detector.nbsp; This can provide measures of six elements of the scattering phase matrix, at multiple scattering angles. Previous polar nephelometer technology has stopped halfway, modulating polarization at the light source, but then only measuring intensity at the detector. Thus, existing technology has achieved measurements of only two phase matrix elements (P11 and P12).

EpiCypher® is developing fully defined recombinant designer nucleosomes (dNucs) carrying specific histone
PTMs to enable epigenetics research and drug development. The power of EpiCypher’s dNuc platform comes
from its broad chemical diversity. EpiCypher has commercialized rt 100 unique dNucs, covering the most widely
studied PTM classes (e.g. lysine methylation / acylation / ubiquitylation, arginine methylation, serine
phosphorylation, etc.) and is leveraging the emergent property of this diversity for a range of high value
applications: 1) antibody specificity testing (NucleoPlex® antibody validation: e.g. chromatinantibodies.com); 2)
ultra-sensitive genomic mapping (CUTANA® CUTandRUN / CUTandTag assays); and 3) high-throughput
biochemical approaches for drug discovery and inhibitor screening (dCypher® assays). To date, EpiCypher’s
dNuc technology (and related assay platforms) have been focused on PTMs with known associations with
chromatin states and gene regulation. Relying on the field’s largely descriptive histone PTM studies as a guide
is an inefficient way for us to expand our discovery platforms and maximize the potential of our nucleosome
generating capability to target the most functionally important PTMs. Progress on the discovery side has been
hindered by intractability of the multi-copy histone genes for functional genetics studies in mammals (vs. simpler
model organisms). Here, EpiCypher is partnering with Dr. Steven Josefowicz (Weill Cornell Medical
School) to expand epigenetic tool development for immunology research and biomarker discovery. The
innovation of this project is employment of a first-in-class mammalian histone variant H3.3 genetic replacement
method to identify orphaned / underappreciated residues (and PTMs) with roles in macrophage stimulation. We
will then develop new dNucs containing these PTMs and validate their role in macrophage function. For proof of
concept, we developed the histone replacement assay to characterize the role of some highly studied (e.g.
H3.3K4, H3.3K36) and underappreciated (H3.3S31) residues in the macrophage stimulation response, and
showed the resulting data can immediately be used to guide the delivery of new epigenetic reagents and assays
to support the study of immune system function and disease. In Phase II, we will leverage this development
pipeline to identify novel resides vital for macrophage stimulation (Aim 1). Next, we will develop a collection of
dNucs carrying PTMs on these resides, which will be used in NucleoPlex assays to identify best-in-class
antibodies to each target (Aim 2). Finally, we will validate the function of these novel PTMs in immune cell
stimulation using CUTandTag assays as well as share our expanded reagents and capabilities with key opinion
leaders for external validation (Aim 3) Together, this work will result in the commercialization of an

Due to complexity of spacecraft systems, operations management will be prohibitively time consuming and computationally intensive. Off-nominal events may occur that limit crew activity or capacity. Furthermore, space habitats like Lunar Gateway may operate without crew for weeks, months, or even years at a time, necessitating autonomous operations.

Gene therapies remain promising candidates for a broad range of intractable diseases, however their complexity
renders traditional biopharmaceutical manufacturing procedures inefficient, costly, and impractical. Given that a
single dose of an AAV-delivered gene therapy may require purification of virus from 60 L of culture media or
more, there is an urgent and unmet need to streamline the process with a scalable, high throughput, and cost-
effective solution. While ultracentrifugation and chromatography are the most common methods for AAV
purification, there is currently no “gold standard” method in commercial production. These limitations of current
methods have motivated Isolere Bio, Inc. to develop an innovative purification platform for viruses: ViraTag™.
ViraTag™ involves two sequential steps. First, the viruses are affinity captured by a custom protein reagent and
the user triggers a liquid-liquid phase transition by a simple environmental change, such as the addition of salt
or heat. The virus particles are sequestered into water-immiscible droplets, with host cell proteins and other
cellular contaminants left behind in the aqueous phase. Second, once contaminants have been washed away,
the AAV are extracted from the droplets by lowering pH, which releases them from the capture reagent.
ViraTag™ addresses key requirements for an ideal purification process, including: 1) linear scalability to
accommodate 103 to 105 L of input media; 2) mild elution conditions to preserve vector function and therapeutic
efficacy; 3) validated compatibility with automated downstream purification instrumentation and workflows used
in biomanufacturing, and 4) the potential to isolate capsids containing therapeutic nucleic acid payloads away
from empty capsids. During Phase I of this SBIR Fast track proposal, we will engineer a new ViraTag™ reagent
capable of affinity capture and phase separation of AAV particles, and evaluate its efficiency in AAV purification
from cell culture media. We will also evaluate the ability of this new affinity capture reagent to distinguish “full”
versus “empty” capsids, an urgently needed capability currently only enabled by ultracentrifugation methods that
cannot be scaled up. Phase II will focus on scale-up of ViraTag™ manufacturing, by developing workflows and
product form factors for various application scales, and benchmarking the purity of final products against current
methods. Phase II will also include external validation of the process by laboratories representative of the
product’s target customers, ranging from bench-scale academic research to large-scale biopharma.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Biomanufacturing of engineered viruses is a challenging and rate-limiting process which impacts the cost, safety
and efficacy of gene therapies. Traditional ultracentrifugation and chromatography methods are currently
employed for purification but are inefficient, costly, and impractical to scale up for gene therapy viral vectors.
Isolere Bio, Inc. has developed ViraTag™, a novel non-chromatographic purification process capable of affinity-
capture of adeno-associated viruses (AAV) and their subsequent isolation away from contaminants via
conditional liquid-liquid phase transition. AAV capsids can be sequestered into ViraTag™ droplets away from
contaminants and then subsequently released from ViraTag™ droplets in a user-triggered manner for collection
of pure product. This technology addresses the currently unmet need for a cost-effective, high yielding, and
scalable purification method for manufacturing gene therapy vectors.",  ,,,,KELLI M LUGINBUHL,,(719) 322-4394,kluginbuhl@isolerebio.com,,  ,

Such algorithms would enable e.g. optimization of mask and ventilator supply chains and provide supporting analysis for lockdown/opening decisions.  Beyond COVID-19, the need for such algorithms - that deal effectively with the non-stationary aspects of short-term data - is broad. Here we propose to develop such a class of non-stationary prediction algorithms from the prototype we developed within the DARPA PAI and AIRA Artificial Intelligence Exploration projects and used on prediction of infection cases from COVID-19 and AFRL supplied data on corrosion processes. Current data-driven prediction algorithms largely depend on stationarity assumption. Classical statistical methods based either on frequentist or Bayesian frameworks fit into that category, as do many of the modern machine learning methodologies. The latter can be adapted to non-stationary situations, but suffer from requirements for a large amount of labeled data and/or overfitting. Model-based prediction algorithms have been deployed in COVID-19 pandemic analysis but have proven too reliable on the small number of parameters that need to be fitted from the evolving data causing large uncertainties. Our approach relies on Koopman operator theory (KOT). In contrast with the tools described above, formulating a Koopman operator representation from data does not rely on any stationarity assumptions, a long historical sequence of data, or excessive labeling. The mathematical underpinnings of KOT enable adaptive features, where non-stationary deviations from the current state of the process can be detected based on the spectrum of the operator. The framework also enables creation of models from data on the fly.

manned missions to Mars. The Moon is covered by large amounts of dust particles, called regolith, which could cause serious problems
for tribological components on the Moon, which makes dust as the number one concern in returning to the Moon. In addition to dust
issues, the temperature has a large variation between day and night, from cryogenic temperatures of -147deg;C to upwards of 100deg;C.
Therefore, the effect of temperature should also be taken into account in combination with abrasive dust. The reliable operation of
moving parts and tribological components (e.g., bearings, gears, sealings, etc.) in the Moon environment is a key for successful
accomplishment of future NASA missions. Therefore, selection and design of new lubrication and protection are imperative for each
application. Tribological experiments are therefore necessary to simulate relevant environments so as to mitigate mission risk. This
proposal offers unique solutions for these extreme conditions: ATSP coating sliding against ATSP coatings have shown low coefficients
of friction and ldquo;zero wearrdquo; from -196deg;C to 300deg;C. This excellent tribological performance leads us to introduce ATSP-based coatings for
the abrasive conditions and wide thermal demands of the Moon. We will investigate the tribological performance of ATSP-based

in cases for patients and clinicians from the COVID-19 pandemic. In the VA alone, the cost of treating veterans
is over $15B. Unfortunately, treatments for PTSD are often ineffective, have side effects, and high rates of

PTSD but there are no commercially available tVNS devices that meet the needs of researchers to develop

create a clinical research tool that will accelerate the community’s (and our) ability to determine the most
efficacious use of tVNS to improve quality of life for patients with PTSD.Current implementations of non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation do not meet patient or researcher needs for

is flexible, comfortable, portable, and effectively addresses the needs of this population. Clinician-scientists
require a system which meets the complex needs for tVNS research, including high quality stimulation,
programmable stimulation parameter control, and logging of physiologic response and patient usage; while
also presenting a simple user interface for home use by patients.In this project we will develop Evren’s Phoenix Laboratory, which will be the first tVNS device able to meet
these complex needs for both researchers and patients. In Phase I we will develop the stimulator and sensor
hardware (Aim 1A) that serves both as the patient home-use system and also as the tethered researcher

NASA identified seven PLSS venting items that they consider as at risk of operational degradation due to the presence of lunar dust. The intent is to protect these items from the dust that is very invasive, electrostatically and magnetically charged and tends to stick to surfaces due to its static-electricity charges.nbsp;
To meet this need, Lunar Dust Protection Devices will be designed to stop dust from reaching sealing surfaces or hydrophilic membranes within safety critical PLSS components. Self-sealing silicone covers will be developed to protect valves and quick disconnects until activated by crew force or venting gas pressure, while protective screens will be used to protect the membranes, which flow water vapor intermittently. The protection devices will be treated with anti-static elements to reduce lunar dust adherence and use forces, available during EVA or IVA, to encourage gathered dust to fall from them. The forces include lunar gravity, vibration generated by PLSS rotating equipment, crew impact loads while walking/working, overboard gas flow from PLSS components and crew member interaction. Magnetic brushes can take advantage of the dusts magnetic property, during post-EVA, to remove any remaining dust from the devices.
The Lunar Dust Protection Devices will consume very little weight and volume and no power. Each protection device will be developed addressing specific xEMU item geometry, flow rates, flow direction, fluid properties and related human factors. Functioning prototypes will be constructed using accepted manned flight material and design practices and be tested for analytical correlation.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a serious threat to global public health,
necessitating the rapid development of safe and effective medical countermeasures. SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity
requires a series of protein-protein interactions (PPI) involving the virus’ S protein that leads to virus attachment
and fusion. Initially, the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the S protein S1 subunit binds to ACE2 receptors on
the host cell. This triggers a conformational change in the S protein S2 subunit, driving the viral heptad repeat 1
(HR1) and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domains of S2 to form a six-helical bundle (6-HB), enabling the viral envelope
to be brought in close proximity to the host membrane, thus promoting viral fusion. Peptides have emerged
recently as a therapeutic class capable of targeting and disrupting PPI with high affinity and specificity. We
hypothesize antagonism of the virus S protein with a peptide therapeutic will provide an effective anti-viral
strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and potentially a pan-coronavirus intervention. We propose a plan to select
a lead candidate peptide antagonist based upon target binding and viral neutralization in vitro, with consideration
of escape mutants, and attenuation of virus load and shedding in a ferret challenge model in vivo. Successful
completion of this program will support advancement of the lead candidate peptide to IND-enabling studies, and
provide the rationale for submission of a Phase II SBIR proposal to evaluate inhalation delivery for severe
respiratory disease.",  ,,,,JIM  ROTOLO,,(914) 607-6935,jarotolo@hotmail.com,,  ,

The CRQ removes traditional barriers such as large number of comparators (Flash architecture), slow binary search (SAR architecture), power hungry and slow continuous-time comparators and large silicon area consuming time-to-digital converters (temporal ADC). By removing these barriers and taking full benefit of modern CMOS processes, the CRQ offers a high sampling rate at greatly reduced power consumption. A single sub-ADC based on this architecture demonstrates over 4 times speed improvement compared to a SAR ADC. The project will target 8-bit resolution and 56GS/s rate. Instead of overdesigning, when seeking to maximize the performance, the ADC will rely on parameter calibration using a built-in CPU. On-chip phase locked loops (PLLs) will be used for clock synthesis. For convenient interfacing with field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) at up to 64x8.8Gb/s, the ADC will include a JESD204B standard compliant interface.

They can store large amount of energy up to megawatt-hours (MWh). Despite of the tremendous success, however, RFBs employing aqueous electrolytes are fundamentally limited by the narrow electrochemical window of water leading to low cell voltages energy density. By contrast, nonaqueous RFBs with organic electrolytes offer much wider electrochemical window (e.g., over 5 V) and potentially higher solubility for redox compounds, both of which can lead to high energy density. As a critical component in RFB, the separator with highly selective Li+ ion conductivity is an “enabler” of nonaqueous RFBs. Polymeric ion exchange membranes suffer from low ionic conductivity, redox organic-active material (ROM) crossover, and/or membrane fouling by ROM entrapment. Porous separators have high conductivity but limited selectivity causing irreversible ROM crossover and capacity decay. Dense ceramic separator is a promising option to achieve absolute permselectivity and zero ROM crossover in nonaqueous RFBs but suffer from limited mechanical properties. These drawbacks bring significant challenges for delivering high power density and reliable RFB assembly and operations. Therefore, increasing the Li+ conductivity and mechanical strength is the most critical need for ceramic separators to enable high-power, stable nonaqueous RFBs. Storagenergy Technologies Inc. (Storagenergy) and Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) will continue R&D efforts to enable commercial supported ceramic separators for high energy efficiency, high power, and long cycling life nonaqueous RFBs. As the number of generation sources from intermittent renewable technologies on the electric grid increases, the need for large-scale electrical energy storage devices is becoming essential to ensure grid stability and sustainability. Solid-electrode batteries maintain discharge at peak power for far too short a time to fully regulate wind or solar power output. In contrast, RFBs offer an advantage over conventional batteries, as their energy and power can be scaled independently by maintaining all of the electro-active species in fluid form. The successful development of this technology will enable a new family of American batteries of all scales for both commercial and government sectors. And, finally, this technology will serve to re-establish the U.S. technological lead in batteries that has migrated overseas.",  ,,,,Feng  Zhao,,(801) 386-8555,fzhao@storagenergy.com,,  ,

Specifically, refractory materials such as molybdenum, tungsten, and alloys containing them are found to be most resistant in molten salt environment and hence they have great potential to be used as the salt-facing surface layer. Due to the well-recognized difficulties of welding/printing refractory materials (i.e., oxidation, brittle phase formation, cracking, etc.), cold spray, a deposition technology that minimizes material heating, avoids undesired thermal effects and maintains dimension stability, is an ideal approach for fabricating the bimetallic components. Under this SBIR Phase II program, QuesTek Innovations LLC, a leader in the field of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) and 2016 Tibbetts Award recipient, will continue partnering with Solvus Global and Cal Poly Pomona to design, fabricate and validate cold spray enabled bimetallic structures, consisting of a refractory-based corrosion resistant surface layer and an ASME code-certified substrate, for molten salt reactors (MSR). In Phase I, the team has successfully designed and fabricated proof-of-concept bimetallic materials using SS316 as substrate that experimentally exhibited excellent deposition quality, interface adhesion and corrosion resistance. During the Phase II program, the ICME materials design and cold spray processing technology demonstrated in Phase I will continue to be developed and optimized, in tandem with implementing an additional approach of functionally graded materials (FGM) to further improve the robustness and performance of the cold-sprayed structure for nuclear applications. QuesTek will continue applying its ICME materials design methodologies to refine the refractory surface layer compositions developed in Phase I and explore new designs. In addition, QuesTek will be developing and implementing a computational gradient design framework to assist in designing FGM pathways with optimized performance of the bimetallic structure. Solvus Global, a leading company dedicated to advanced cold spray technology, will continue to lead the cold spray related tasks. They will develop the powder materials defined by QuesTek’s computational modeling, optimize cold spray processing parameters, manufacture bimetallic materials, including functionally graded structure, and conduct detailed metallurgical characterization and adhesion tests on the fabricated materials. Prof. Vilupanur Ravi at Cal Poly Pomona (CPP) is a distinguished professor with extensive experience in materials degradation in molten salt environment. His group will continue to perform detailed and carefully designed molten salt corrosion tests and characterization. Towards the end of the 2-year Phase II program, the team will work to further scale-up production efforts based on the down-selected material systems.

However, the processes that govern cloud-aerosol interactions, drizzle formation and precipitation are poorly understood and represent major sources of uncertainty in predictive models. The DOE ARM Facilities and other global atmospheric measurement networks provide data that are used for development and improvement of these models. Quantifying the uncertainty of these measurements is critically important. Although the majority of instruments may be well-characterized in a laboratory setting, deploying them in field conditions greatly increases the measurement uncertainties. Field calibration capabilities need to be developed. This SBIR project is developing an innovative portable, battery-powered aerosol generator for field calibration of atmospheric measurement instrumentation such as in situ cloud droplet probes and aerosol sizing and precipitation measurement instruments. The ultimate goal is to develop a technology that is compact, robust, low-maintenance, user-friendly and inexpensive to allow wide-scale deployment of the proposed aerosol generators over atmospheric measurement facilities. The Phase I study successfully demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed technical approach. The main results include: (1) constructing and characterizing a laboratory prototype of the monodisperse aerosol generator; (2) demonstrating its performance characteristics under a wide range of conditions and outlining the calibration procedures; and (3) identifying the engineering challenges of transitioning the technology to a standalone portable prototype useful for field calibration of atmospheric measurement instrumentation in Phase II. In Phase II, a field deployable prototype of the monodisperse aerosol generator will be designed, built and characterized. The prototype will undergo extensive laboratory and field testing. As a result, a field calibration technology for atmospheric measurement instrumentation that is basically ready for commercialization will be developed. Successful completion of this program will lead to development of a monodisperse aerosol generator primarily designed for field calibration of a variety of atmospheric measurement instruments. When carried over into Phase III and beyond, this project will be of great benefit to the public and the Federal Government. Improved measurement accuracy will lead to development of more precise atmospheric models and, hence, better understanding of the contribution of atmospheric aerosols and clouds to Earth’s radiative budget and global climate trends.",  ,,,,Andrei  Vakhtin,,(505) 216-5015,avakhtin@mesaphotonics.com,,  ,

Conventional electrical interconnect approach suffers from the incapability of disaggregating the storage from the compute over few meters due to the inherent losses associated with transmitting the high bandwidth electrical signals over long distances. Furthermore, power consumption grows dramatically with high I/O and peripheral bandwidth capacity required by high- performance computing systems limiting systems with electrical interconnects as currently deployed. A more power-efficient reconfigurable interconnect fabric is required to deliver the bandwidth capacity for today’s applications that use PCIe-based storage and require high I/O rates. The objective of this SBIR effort is to design, fabricate, build and test a photonic based I/O interfaces to provide high bandwidth connectivity between the server class Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) controllers and Non-Volatile Memory Express (NVMe) storage subsystem for DOE relevant high-performance computing applications. Freedom Photonics objective has designed and fabricated the tunable laser array and to deliver these to Columbia. Year 1 laser array utilizing discrete lasers were fabricated and delivered per schedule. Development of the base chip technology for an integrated WDM source is now ongoing according to schedule. In addition, a Phase II demonstration of low-power laser epitaxial material has been completed that allows efficient operation at 70ºC (only 30% penalty to room temperature). Additional achievements include the demonstration of the first active-passive integration using our high efficiency DFB lasers, in which an InP star coupler can be integrated. Columbia University has (1) designed and fabricated silicon photonic transceiver and switch fabrics and (2) design and implement subsystem controllers to support high-bandwidth and reconfigurable connectivity in the P-SSIO subsystem. During Year I and Year II, silicon photonic microdisk based transmitters and microring based filters were fabricated. They have been shown to be feasible and can support the PCIe Gen3 bandwidth requirements. Columbia has also completed the silicon photonic switch fabrics’ and subsystem controllers’ designs enabling dynamic resource allocation in the subsystem. The testbed demonstrated deep disaggregation of memory and PCIe resources. These initial experiments demonstrate the potential to further integrate the subsystem controller components, and to mature the switch control circuitry and packaging for future system integration. In Phase IIB, we will use Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based MPSoC development boards to implement the host, endpoint, switch nodes based on the Gen3 PCIe specification. As we developed in both Phase I and Phase II, the subsystem controllers, including the optical network controller and the optical switch controller, have been shown to be functional and operational. In Phase IIB, Columbia will further integrate these subsystem controller components with the Silicon Photonic (SiP) circuit switch, mature the switch control circuitry and packaging, and compose a SiP switch unit for the system integration. Freedom Photonics will focus on the development of the optical WDM source and packaging.

State-of-the-art thermal and cold neutron sources are large expensive national facilities, which serve diverse community of scientific and industrial users. The constant need to improve the instruments performance, stems from the fact that neutron methods are gaining in popularity, and becoming more and more powerful, while new neutron sources are not being constructed to keep pace with the developments and needs of the scientific community. Small research reactors at universities and National Labs, and laboratory-based neutron generators, are necessary not only for education and training, but also when samples cannot be transported to other facilities. However, the standard neutron techniques, which were developed for high-flux facilities, require much higher efficiencies to be used effectively with the low fluxes of small sources. Thus, the efficient use of neutron sources, such as with our proposed analyzer, is important for the progress and broader use of these neutron techniques. We propose to design and demonstrate novel diffractive optical device, which will enable very efficient residual stress neutron diffractometers. The proposed device will be a multi-foil analyzer, where each foil is constructed of focusing bent single crystals of Si. Such device will enable polychromatic residual stress neutron diffraction. At large national facilities, such as at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, these analyzers would enable very fast measurements for determining residual stress tensors, raster large samples or screen multiple samples.

One of the biggest challenges facing wind energydevelopment on small and mid-sized farms are the adverse effects of wind farms on bats. To reducecollision-related mortality of bats curtailment -- stopping wind turbines from spinning during timesof high bat activity -- is employed. While beneficial for bats curtailment results in lost renewableenergy and lost revenue which reduces the annual lease payment to small and mid-size farms. Thisproject aims to develop next-generation smart curtailment algorithms that save just as many bats ascurrent technologies for less lost renewable energy. Smart curtailment involves fitting an algorithmto environmental data to predict times that are risky for bats (times to curtail) or not (times to notcurtail). No current technologies acknowledge the dynamic cost of curtailment across wind speeds.The project team will design and implement a dynamic cost function for decision tree algorithms.The dynamic cost function will allow the algorithm to optimize a smart curtailment regime byexplicitly accounting for the cost of curtailment at different wind speeds (the cost of curtailment isproportional to a cubic function of wind speed). The new software will be applied to prototypicaldata to assess its efficacy.

Retrievals to produce continuous, high temporal resolution cloud optical properties and tools for in-field calibrations will remove two barriers to successful, routine use of shortwave spectral radiation measurements by the broader scientific community. A near infrared enhanced version of the cloud properties sensor was developed and deployed during Phase 1. Measurements of spectral radiance and retrievals of cloud optical depth, droplet effective radius and thermodynamic phase, the latter two a result of algorithm development during Phase 1, compared well with other co-located instruments. This and similar demonstration projects have garnered interest in this new instrumentation for science goals that can be explored in field deployments planned for the near future. The field calibrator concept, based on a small integrating sphere, a temperature-controlled LED, and a compound parabolic concentrator to increase the effective exit aperture of the sphere, was a partial success in Phase I testing. The Phase 2 project will build on these results by constructing four near infrared enhanced cloud properties sensors, possibly extending the range to 2500 nm for more robust phase retrieval.

Unfortunately, writing parallel programs under a hybrid model (if not harder) is as hard as writing shared-memory or message-passing concurrent programs, which have been plagued by concurrency-related bugs such as race conditions. Race conditions are notoriously diffi cult to detect and debug because they are nondeterministic, often leading to unrepeatable computing results, unexpected program failures, hangs, crashes, or data corruptions. Despite intensive R/R&D efforts in both academia and industry, existing techniques and tools for detecting and debugging race conditions such as ThreadSanitizer, TotalView, Intel Inspector and CIVL remain inadequate, because they incur prohibitive runtime perturbation, miss real errors, generate many false alarms, lack diagnostic information, or do not scale to large HPC applications. In particular, most existing approaches are designed for late phases of software development, e.g., testing or production. As a result, it is often too late to find a race condition bug or it becomes too expensive to fix the bug. Moreover, scaling these approaches to large codebases is diffi cult without sacrificing detection coverage or accuracy. The overall objective of the combined Phase I and Phase II projects is to develop a fast, precise and scalable race detector for extreme-scale computing applications written under a hybrid model of MPI, threads and OpenMP constructs. It is expected that the developed system will automatically detect race conditions in HPC C/C++/Fortran programs containing over a million lines of code with very fast speed and high precision. The key technology behind our innovation is a new compiler-based program analysis abstraction called di.fferential concurrency analysis (DCA) that judiciously combines three change-centric analyses —pointer alias analysis, array index analysis, and happens-before analysis— to reduce the average computational complexity of analyzing a parallel program to proportional to the size of the code changes (instead of the entire codebase). The technology has the potential to detect all concurrency-related bugs in large-scale complex programs continuously and immediately after they are introduced in an IDE, by a code commit, or by a pull request. For concurrency errors that are undecidable statically, the technology will insert minimal runtime checks to validate them precisely, by a novel combination of static and dynamic analyses to create, validate, replay, and explain the errors, and to prune away false positives. The technical details of DCA, authored by the PI and other key personnel of Coderrect Inc., have been published as full research papers in top ACM venues (PLDI’18 and TOPLAS’19), as well as a HPC correctness workshop (Correctness’18). In Phase I, Coderrect Inc. has successfully demonstrated the technical feasibility of this project through developing a core analysis engine and evaluating on a variety of ECP Proxy applications. In Phase II, the goal is to turn the core engine into a full-fledged product that can create value for our potential customers. This technology once commercialized can have significant impact in improving correctness, reliability and developer productivity of HPC software applications written in C/C++/Fortran with MPI/Pthreads/OpenMP. It is expected that in the long term this project will drastically improve the reliability and productivity of extreme-scale parallel programming and enable more widespread adoption of in situ analysis tools to detect defects in parallel programs. It will also significantly reduce the cost of software maintenance, in-house testing, failure diagnosis and debugging of scientific applications.",  ,,,,Bradley  Swain,,(979) 218-1572,brad@coderrect.com,,  ,

However, there is still lack of suitable separators for future new battery chemistries. Some novel liquid electrolytes (such as ionic liquid and aqueous electrolytes) with enhanced safety and low cost features are also delayed to be applied in commercial batteries, due to no compatible separators. In this project, TalosTech LLC and California Institute of Technology developed a new class of separators to fill the market gap and facilitate the development and commercialization of new battery chemistries such as sodium-ion batteries with novel liquid electrolytes. Our novel separators are tailor-made by an innovative tape-freeze casting technology, with the features of vertically aligned pore structure, which has excellent wettability with various liquid electrolytes and provides a short working-ion transportation path for high ionic conductivity. In Phase I, we demonstrated the technical feasibility to use the laboratory-scale freeze casting process to make such kind of tunable separators. The developed separators showed much better wettability and ionic transport properties than commercial polyolefin-type separators, and delivered excellent cell performance for sodium ion batteries in both cyclic carbonate and ionic liquid electrolytes. In Phase II, we will optimize the freeze casting technology with deep understanding of the process parameters, develop separator prototypes for sodium ion batteries in various liquid electrolytes, and scale up the technology to a roll-to-roll continuous production process. Upon the success of this project, we will partner with large material companies and battery separator manufacturers to commercialize this technology, promoting the development and commercialization of more safe and sustainable battery technologies.",  ,,,,Hansan  Liu,,(302) 332-9236,hansan.liu@talostechllc.com,California Institute of Technology,  ,

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms are becoming a way of rapidly predicting materials properties. However, recent surveys have shown an under-representation by companies that could leverage HPC technologies and AI/ML meth- ods. One reason is that codes of interest can be complex to build and use and a second reason is that moving away from local workstations to take advantage of HPC resources can be filled with difficulties particularly for small and medium commercial users. We will extend the capabilities of the ’Chemistream’ framework in order to provide: access to a va- riety of material properties databases (some funded by DOE), access to specific AI/ML algorithms and advanced workflows to optimize molecular design using AI/ML models. During Phase I we integrated the use of S3 persistent storage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure ’Blob Storage’ into the Chemistream application. During Phase I we identified the steps needed to extend the NREL Bond Dissociation Energy (BDE) database. These steps include accessing persistent cloud storage for updating current database information and running DFT calculations using NWChem. We also identified the steps for using AI/ML techniques to predict partial charges using the NREL organic photovoltaic (OPV) database. Lastly, this work has been prototyped in examples integrated into Chemistream and running on cloud resources. The proposed Phase II work will develop integrated access to AI/ML molecular databases for training new models. This unified interface will enable access to pre-existing molecular databases as well as custom workflows for generating specific, user-defined training data. Phase II work will also streamline development for AI/ML training models to predict small molecule properties relevant to the nanotech and pharmaceuticals industries. Finally, Phase II work will prototype examples for optimizing the design of advanced materials with Reinforcement-Learning (RL). This progress will positively impact one of the goals of the Materials Genome initiative to enhance the rate of breakthroughs in complex materials chemistry and materials design.

There is therefore a strong need to realize the promise of complex nanosystems by developing atomically precise manufacturing (APM). This project targets a key component of an Atomically Precise Manufacturing system: a high-speed sub-nanometer-precision manufacturing platform for atomic precision patterning and hierarchical assembly. The Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) has the requisite patterning precision for APM, but its throughput is inadequate for a manufacturing tool. Our overall objective is to devise a new physical and control implementation of the STM based on Micro-Electrical Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology for high-speed imaging and high-throughput lithography, which does not suffer from many of the limitations of piezoelectric scanners, first developed in 1982 and largely unchanged. The use of MEMS technology will also enable the possibility of developing an STM with multiple tips scanning simultaneously, so as to scale the overall throughput of a lithography tool for APM. A 1 Degree of Freedom (DOF) MEMS z actuator has been designed and fabricated at UT Dallas. It has been used to take atomic-resolution images in a hybrid STM at Zyvex Labs using the MEMS 1DOF z actuator to maintain the tip height through the tunnel current feedback loop, with a piezo tube performing the xy scanning. This is the first time a MEMS based STM has demonstrated atomic resolution imaging. The z actuator is being combined with a flexure-stage xy scanner to create a high- speed STM, which will be scaled up to multiple tips. Designs for 3DOF xyz MEMS scanners have been completed. What is planned for Phase IIB: (1) Further develop the successful 1DOF z actuator by using a new integrated tip concept from UTD which is an outcome of our DOE 1465 program, allowing for mass production of a commercial product; (2) Commercialize the 1DOF z actuator in collaboration with ScientaOmicron, identifying the advantages of a hybrid STM over a standard STM of interest to microscopy customers, and creating a viable product offering, similar to their QPlus AFM/STM product; (3) Implement the two-tip 1DOF Z actuator with a tilt stage on the flexure stage STM, and demonstrate simultaneous STM imaging with two tips; and (4) Contingent on a viable 3DOF MEMS actuator as an outcome of our 1465 program, we will test their capability for STM. Zyvex, which has a history of commercializing innovative nanotechnology products, will introduce these high-speed, ultra-high precision stages to first address the STM imaging research market at universities, national labs and commercial research companies, and move on to develop research tools for nano-manufacturing development, then metrology and inspection tools for advanced high precision manufacturing, and finally will enable Atomically Precise Manufacturing as a platform both for parallel atomic precision patterning and parallel hierarchical assembly.

Current instruments aimed at performing this task are both lacking the imaging stability to get good high-resolution images and intimidating/complex to use, which has severely limited their accessibility to researchers and subsequently minimized their impact on science. Both the DOE and the research community in the quantum field have expressed a need for an easy-to-use and highly stable liquid helium-cooled TEM sample holder in order for the fundamental atomic-level physics of quantum systems to be understood and exploited. In response to this need, Hummingbird Scientific has successfully developed, prototyped, and tested new liquid helium (LHe) cooled side-entry holder with in-situ biasing capabilities to demonstrate proof-of-concept in Phase I. Our design is aimed at making LHe temperature imaging and in-situ experimentation more accessible by reducing cooldown times, simplifying biasing connections, and improving sample stability, and thus imaging conditions. Our Phase I results demonstrate that our design can successfully deliver the core capabilities of the product, i.e., extended thermal stability at ~10 Kelvin, electrical biasing, and high-resolution imaging stability. Based on these results, Hummingbird Scientific will in Phase II further develop and commercialize this technology into an advanced LHe cryo/biasing TEM specimen holder with the following features and capabilities: (1) an easy-to-use and reliable electrical stimulus to the sample, (2) double-tilt (α-tilt and β-tilt control) mechanism to orient the sample in several crystallographic facets for structural mapping, (3) Stepwise variable temperature control, and (4) long imaging time (> 1 hour) at high atomic resolution imaging mode. When commercialization efforts of these in-situ TEM systems succeed as expected, these methods will become widely available to researchers for understanding interactions over a heretofore-unexplored range of materials and temperatures for these electronic material systems. This will have a direct positive and accelerating effect on commercial electronic device development as well as on the production of next-generation electronic and quantum computing devices.",  ,,,,Khim  Karki,,(360) 252-2737,khim_karki@hummingbirdscientific.com,,  ,

Particle Identification (PID) subsystems, often operating in magnetic fields >1.5 Tesla, require highly segmented (2-3 mm pixel) photodetectors with high gain, low intrinsic background, and high photocathode efficiency to support the high rates found in noisy radiation environments. Large Area Picosecond Photo Detectors (LAPPD™) currently being commercialized by Incom, Inc. has demonstrated many of the needed requirements, however, there is still much development and optimization needed for LAPPD™ to be a candidate for these applications. Development and demonstration of a pixelated readout is essential for Electron Ion Collider (EIC) R&D efforts and can potentially provide an upgrade option for current Nuclear Physics PID subsystems. The development of the High Rate Picosecond Photon Detector (HRPPD) was initiated by Incom Inc. under DOE NP Phase I SBIR project (award DE-SC0020578) to fulfill specific requirements on photosensors to have a pixelated readout with 3 mm x 3 mm pixel size and perform at high rates (200 kHz/cm2) in a 2-3 Tesla magnetic field as exemplified by the EIC collaboration, and other NP programs. Realization of these features in 20 cm x 20 cm form factor LAPPD™ currently being commercialized by Incom Inc. is rather challenging although LAPPD has already demonstrated picosecond timing, high gain, low noise and high Quantum Efficiency (QE). In order to meet these needs, a new direct readout anode was demonstrated in Phase I to offer improved signal to noise compared to alternative approaches. Because of the complexity the technical development for this novel anode, it was decided to prototype it initially using a smaller 10 cm x 10 cm form before scaling up to full size (20 cm X 20 cm) LAPPD size. Over the course of Phase I project we have demonstrated feasibility of directly coupled 3 mm x 3 mm anode readout; developed 10 cm x 10 cm ALD functionalized MCPs with 10-micron pores for better timing and magnetic field tolerance and tested a fully functional open face High Rate Picosecond Photo Detector (HRPPD) package. The main objective of this Phase II project will be to demonstrate fully functional sealed HRPPD suitable for pilot production, test and evaluate prototype HRPPD in practical beamline trials. This will be realized in the following steps. Performing multiple sealing trials with HRPPD packages. Based on our experience with sealing 20 cm x 20 cm LAPPDs, multiple iterations of 10 cm x 10 cm detector packages will used to find an optimal sidewall geometry and metallization. Sealing HRPPD sidewalls to an entry window will be used to evaluate the designs with a goal of 80% sealing yield. Development of a reliable production process for large area 10-micron pore MCPs. As mentioned above under Phase I project, 108 mm x 108 mm 10-micron ALD-GCA-MCPs have been produced. However, the production yield for these GCA-ALD-MCPs was rather low due to the need to refine the production of large format 10-micron pore. In this Phase II we will increase yields and quality of larger format 10-micron pore MCPs by improving GCA fusing process and optimizing ALD process. Performing sealing trials with a complete MCP stack. Several sealing trials with a complete detector package will be initiated in a dedicated Integration and Sealing Tank. These fully functioning detectors will have a standard bi-alkali photocathode, a pair of 10-micron pore ALD-GCA-MCPs, and a pixelated or capacitively coupled readout. Characterization of HRPPD. In order to characterize the HRPPD, a dedicated readout board will be designed. Quantum Efficiency, gain, timing and spatial resolution, and the high-rate capability of HRPPD will be measured in a dedicated setup. Magnetic Field Tolerance HRPPD performance at high magnetic fields (up to 3T) will be evaluated. LAPPD™ and the HRPPD will enable new techniques in HEP, homeland security (non-proliferation) sensors to screen vehicles and cargo for Special Nuclear Materials (SNMs) and scientific detectors for astrophysics, time-of-flight mass spectrometry and medical imaging products including detectors for positron emission tomography (PET scanning) that are not accessible with conventional small area MCP-PMTs.",  ,,,,Michael  Foley,,(508) 909-2320,mrf@incomusa.com,,  ,

This imaging provides a wealth of information about the presence, extent, morphology and progression of root systems and other phenomena. The current bottleneck for analyzing such imagery is the laborious process of manually marking roots. The purpose of the present work is to develop a system using machine learning and image processing to automatically detect and characterize roots in minirhizotron imagery. Root image analysis is currently a time and labor-intensive process that involves individual technicians and researchers manually identifying root locations, often using outdated and error prone software. A trained labeler can process between 5 and 7 images per hour, often working on datasets with thousands of images, and their labels can be prone to fatigue-related errors and inconsistency between different labelers. Manually labeling images is therefore a costly diversion from scientific analysis of imagery and a barrier preventing broader use of minirhizotron imagery both in the research and commercial markets. This research approach merges classical computer vision with machine learning to create a pipeline that can automatically detect and characterize root systems using non-destructive minirhizotron imagers. It doesn’t require even more laborious pixel-level mask creation and instead draws its training data from existing point-to-point labeling commonly used by researchers. While this labeling is not itself pixel accurate and often noisy and inaccurate, the custom processing pipeline is able to produce pixel-accurate segmentation, which can then be processed to generate the root characteristics desired by researchers. As there are a wide variety of root and soil combinations, creating a universal model is difficult and likely to trade accuracy in favor of universality. The proposed research recognizes and acknowledges this by focusing on a process that allow both the potential for a universal model, but also an ability to generate more targeted models quickly and with limited user intervention. It has been validated in Phase I research by training successful models against two different datasets from different imaging systems and different environments. In Phase II the successful machine learning methodology that was developed in Phase I will be continued to create ""Rhizomatic"", a cloud service for automatically detecting and characterizing roots.

Many fields of science and applied science are informed by these techniques and their results power the world economy. To push the knowledge frontier of these sciences, X-ray sources are being continually upgraded for properties like higher intensity and better focus. As a consequence, they come up against the limits of existing X-ray detectors to record intense X-ray pulses, and therefore they require new, advanced detectors with which to record their X-ray patterns. This grant will use newly-developed high end detector sensing electronics, and with them design and create a new high-resolution pixelated detector for taking high speed pictures of X-ray patterns. The new detector has the capability to integrate signals from X-ray patterns, and record them at orders of magnitude higher rate than is possible with existing commercial detector products used at these facilities. This detector is also a perfect companion for free electron laser sources, which have few suitable options for measuring the near-instantaneous X-ray diffraction and scattering patterns. The Phase II project builds on the success of the previous Phase I project, the fruits of which were: the development of new detector sensing electronics, the manufacture of a working small test detector, a test of operating at low temperature which showed how to remove the image noise, development of readout and image display software, and a design strategy for the Phase II project of scaling up the detector to the necessary size for world class research experiments. The excellent data quality produced by this new detector will inform many branches of science utilizing the diffraction, scattering, and microscopy techniques at these X-ray facilities.

The current materials used cannot handle the heat loads and radiation intensity anticipated. Currently, there are no manufacturers of such material in the US. We propose the growth of high-quality single-crystal diamonds in the laboratory by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The CVD technique does not suffer by the size limitations of other synthesis methods and can produce material with the highest purity, thermal conductivity, and radiation hardness available. Euclid Techlabs has designed a growth strategy to produce diffraction grade diamond plates with the desired material properties. In Phase 1, we have developed strategies for growing high quality, low strain, and dislocation material, which eventually can scale to larger sizes than diamond materials produced by other methods. Due to covid-19, single crystal diamond seed plates with significant areas (> 10 mm2) free of bulk defects arrived too late to properly prepare the surfaces, a critical part of the strategy. We were able to grow ca. 0.6 to 0.9 mm of epitaxial diamond on two initial plates (but not optimized to our strategy). Assessment of the quality of the epitaxial layers grown demonstrated areas as large as 1 mm2 with a very low strain-induced birefringence caused by defects implying low or no dislocations which is supported initial x-ray topography images. These results imply that we will be able to produce diffraction grade diamond by CVD.In Phase II, we will build our custom CVD reactor facility, acquire, and prepare appropriate diamond seed plates. Once the facility is operational, we will implement our growth strategy developed in Phase I for defect-free epitaxial CVD diamond single growth. To assist the development of the growth strategy, we will perform optical polarimetry, x-ray topography, x-ray rocking curve measurement, optical surface profilometry, photoluminescence, and other diagnostics as needed and appropriate. Finally, we will design and test preliminary prototype x-ray optical elements for commercialization. Enabling X-ray sources' high brightness will allow a new generation of measurements that could have a revolutionary impact across a broad area of science, including biology, medicine, cancer treatment, and quantum information.",  ,,,,James  Butler,,(301) 637-0885,i.ponomarev@euclidtechlabs.com,,  ,

During recent conflicts, burn was one of the most frequent sources of injury to the eye and adnexa. It is worth noting that chemical/thermal burn is an integral part of explosion injuries, which account for more than 70% of eye injuries on the battlefield. Chemical injuries to the eye cause immediate tissue damage and can lead to chronic complications and blindness. In contrast to acids, basic chemicals interact with fatty acids, leading to greater and faster (within minutes) tissue penetration, subsequent to saponification and disruption of cell membranes. Unfortunately, alkaline burn occurs more often than acid burn. The impact of severe chemical burns on the eye is profound, including eyelid skin damage, corneal opacification, neovascularization, limbal stem cell deficiency, anterior chamber inflammation, cataract formation, and even damage to the posterior segment including the development of glaucoma and loss of retinal ganglion cells. Current treatments focus on rapid removal of chemicals via irrigation and reducing subsequent inflammation to prevent complications. Despite these, detrimental damages to the ocular surface still occur. Treatments for chemical injuries, particularly in austere and prolonged field care settings are extremely limited. Therefore, an effective and ready-to-use therapeutic at the time of injury and a modality to prevent permanent vision-threatening sequelae in the sub-acute phase have the potential to change the current standard of care and positively affect outcomes for the injured Warfighter. In preliminary studies, our team found that the oxygen level in the aqueous humor decreased to 30% of normal level within a few minutes following acute alkaline burn. Hypoxia directly leads to tissue damage, and more importantly triggers leukocyte infiltration and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. However, systemic delivery of oxygen, via hyperbaric chamber, nasal canula, or facial mask, is infeasible outside well-equipped medical facilities. Our team’s patented supersaturated oxygen emulsion (SSOE) is a biocompatible perfluorodecalin emulsion manufactured in hyperbaric condition and is capable of addressing this gap in topical oxygen delivery. Our preliminary data demonstrate that a single topical application of SSOE as an ophthalmic emulsion at time of alkali burn is efficacious in reducing ocular inflammation, opacity and cataract formation in vivo. The proposed sequential Phase II SBIR will allow Coruna to continue this important work in a larger animal model, fully characterize the SSOE, and develop a clear commercialization and regulatory path.",Dr. Trish  Henry,,,patricia.a.henry78.civ@mail.mil,Kathryn  Pate,,(303) 775-3898,kathryn.m.pate@gmail.com,,  ,

Recently, transmission electron microscopy observations of materials at cryogenic temperatures have gathered significant interest, particularly for evaluating materials related to quantum information systems. Only at temperatures below what can be achieved with liquid nitrogen can the magnetic phases, superconductivity, and topological states of these materials be studied, and only transmission electron microscopy can provide nanometer spatial resolution data. Stable, liquid helium temperature cooled samples in the microscope are therefore necessary to study the most relevant quantum phenomena in sufficient detail. However, there is currently no dedicated transmission electron microscope stage solution specifically designed to stably image samples between liquid helium (4K) and liquid nitrogen (77K) temperatures, and that allows high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy of samples throughout that temperature range. In Phase I, Hummingbird Scientific successfully designed, built, and tested a liquid helium temperature internal TEM sample motion stage. This proof-of-concept stage has demonstrated that a retrofit internal stage is a viable commercial product and can address the scientific community’s need for high-resolution transmission electron microscope imaging at temperatures below 77K. Our proposed Phase II commercialization work plan focuses on (1) further optimization of the stage performance based on our Phase I performance results, (2) developing the necessary beta tilt, robotic sample handling for sample loading, and biasing capabilities required for a commercial product, (3) build and test each new feature to a beta LHe TEMstage, and (4) preparing the product for launch by beta testing, manufacturing cost reduction, and compatibility with the major original equipment manufacturer transmission electron microscope configurations. When commercialization efforts of this ultra-low temperature in-situ TEM stage succeed as expected, these methods will become widely available to researchers for understanding interactions over a heretofore-unexplored range of materials and temperatures for quantum material systems. This product will be key in allowing scientists to expand the knowledge of structure-property relationships in materials, specifically the relation between temperature and electronic properties, and will allow for the accelerated development of the next generation of quantum-inspired technologies and 2D materials.",  ,,,,Daan Hein  Alsem,,(360) 252-2737,daan_alsem@hummingbirdscientific.com,,  ,

The sensitivity of conventional photoconductive terahertz detectors is limited due to the trade-off between ultrafast operation and quantum efficiency, which restricts the number of photogenerated carriers that can efficiently contribute to terahertz detection. Another problem of conventional photoconductive terahertz detectors is the necessity of an extremely precise optical alignment. This tight optical alignment requirement also prevents researchers from realizing terahertz detector arrays since it is very challenging to align the optical beam on multiple detectors simultaneously. As a result, conventional THz-TDS systems use single-pixel detectors and raster scanning to capture the image/spectrum of an object, which requires significantly long measurement times. To address all of the limitations of conventional photoconductive terahertz detectors, Lookin, Inc. proposes to develop terahertz focal plane arrays (THz-FPAs) that offer large field-of-view and high-sensitivity operation. The company plans to build two different THz-FPAs; (1) a one-dimensional THz-FPA consisting of 1024 pixels for line scanning, (2) a 256×256 THz-FPA for two-dimensional scanning. To realize these products and demonstrate their capabilities, Lookin, Inc. will adapt new nanofabrication techniques, design read-out circuits/boards, and take terahertz images of various objects with the fabricated THz-FPA prototypes at high scan speeds. Lookin, Inc. will also develop a software that can process the output of the FPA pixels in real time to generate terahertz images and videos. The building block of the proposed THz-FPAs will be the high-performance photoconductive terahertz detector, which was developed by Lookin during the Phase I SBIR program. The detector uses an array of photoconductive nanoantennas integrated with a plasmonic nanocavity, which is specifically designed to increase the optical absorption around the nanoantennas. This approach enabled boosting the efficiency of photoconductive terahertz detectors by three orders of magnitude. As a result, high-SNR THz-TDS operation was achieved even at very low optical pump power levels. In addition, by using nanoantenna arrays and distributing them over a large area, Lookin’s detector requires a much less demanding optical alignment compared to conventional photoconductive detectors. The area of this novel detector based on nanoantenna arrays can be easily scalable to build multi-pixel terahertz detector arrays. Broadband THz-FPAs with high sensitivity and high efficiency would revolutionize the terahertz technology market by addressing the most crucial needs of practical THz-TDS systems. They not only improve the performance of THz-TDS systems in their current applications, but they also enable new applications. Such THz-FPAs would transform THz-TDS systems from a metrology tool with a slow scan speed and limited field-of-view to a high-throughput instrument that can be used in industrial settings for various quality control applications.",  ,,,,NEZIH  YARDIMCI,,(734) 546-1878,tolga.yardimci89@gmail.com,,  ,

SiO2 is an SBA Defense SBIR/STTR Innovation Portal (DSIP) small business. SiO2âs primary containers are wholly manufactured in the United States and are the only available glass-equivalent alternative to traditional Type I borosilicate glass. SiO2 manufactures medical-grade polymer primary containers, including those for autoinjectors, that are coated using Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) with a thin (20 nanometer), transparent, glass-like layer that provides a highly effective barrier to environmental gases and leachables. SiO2 also uses these manufacturing techniques to deliver glass-equivalent, ready-to-use vials, silicone oil free syringes and lubricated plungers, as well as blood collection tubes and other medical cartridges. SiO2 has developed and industrialized a novel technique for applying thin, transparent silica-based coatings on the inside surface of polymer containers, including vials, pre-filled syringes, and cartridges. This same technique is be applied to the inside surface of autoinjector containers. SiO2 applies the silica coating to the container in a unit operation where the container serves as the plasma reactor vessel. This approach ensures precise control of the coating process and simplifies the scale-up. Scale-up is achieved by replicating each unit operation. The material properties of SiO2âs pre-filled syringes for drug delivery provide unparalleled drug stability for a wide range of complex biopharmaceuticals. In addition, the containers are shatterproof and up to 15 times more dimensionally consistent than glass containers. When used in autoinjectors and drug delivery pumps, SiO2âs containers and pre-filled syringes increase the performance reliability of these drug delivery devices compared to glass containers. SiO2âs silicone oil free syringe provides the safest most robust platform for drug delivery. SiO2âs hybrid material has superior chemical, mechanical, and thermal durability and can withstand significantly more force without breakage compared to a traditional borosilicate glass syringe. The strength of the flange and hub regions of SiO2âs syringes well exceed normal use in an autoinjector device. The flange strength is 3-5 times stronger than glass syringes.

In these conditions, X-ray intensity will become too severe for the existing materials. Diamond is the most promising, if not only candidate, due to its high thermal conductivity, small thermal expansion, and low X-ray absorption. Unfortunately, the availability of large size, high-crystallinity, and low-defect density diamond substrates is very limited. Presently, there are no suppliers of high-quality diamonds with low defect concentrations in the United States to support this rapidly developing field of diamond X-ray optics applications for the next generation sources. We will develop the modified High-Pressure High-Temperature (HPHT) temperature gradient growth technology that will allow growing the highest crystalline quality large diamond crystals, with dislocation density less than 10 cm-2. Among two synthetic diamond lab-grown technologies, the HPHT approach is superior over CVD for X-ray applications due to its near-equilibrium growth nature that allows for large crystals with almost three orders of magnitude fewer defect densities than CVD-grown plates. The main prerequisite for the near dislocation-free HPHT diamond growth is a reduction of nitrogen impurities to less than 1 ppm-level. Unique total environmental control of all processing steps will be utilized to achieve required diamond crystal purity and structure perfection. In Phase I, an extensive process of modeling and optimization of TGG HPHT reactor geometry and growth parameters was conducted. We modeled temperature field distribution inside the HP chamber at different stages of diamond crystal growth. We identify conditions of cell geometry and ambient parameters necessary for increasing the crystal size. Despite COVID-19 obstacles, we were able to conduct two testing runs of HPHT crystal growth, optimized for reduced nitrogen contamination. In tight collaboration with the APS ANL team, the materials were characterized using several X-ray techniques. In addition, we performed optical cross-polarizer analysis, UV-light, and micro- Raman characterization of selected samples. We achieved very encouraging results: the grown crystals had already surpassed the sizes specified in the topic. The largest diamond plate cut from these crystals has dimensions 6.5x6.5x0.5 mm3. White-beam x-ray topography demonstrated near dislocation free quality, and analysis of spatial variations in the Bragg angle from the ideal direction was within 300 nrad/mm2 for the best sample. In Phase II, we will address the remaining HP cell design and technological questions and build a custom HPHT diamond reactor system. Multiple optimization trials will be performed to identify the best growth conditions for large size high-quality diamonds. X-ray and other characterizations will be conducted and analyzed after each test. At the end of Phase II, we will be well prepared to scale up and commercialize high-quality diamond substrates for scientific applications. This project's long-term goal is to establish the first USA-based HPHT diamond growth facility capable of producing the highest quality large SC diamonds matching X-ray optics requirements. The technology developed here is required to utilize X-ray beams at fourth generation light sources to maximum potential. High-quality diamond is virtually the only material that can withstand the next- generation light sources' heat load.

One of the Air Force top priorities is to obtain rapid, precise, decision-quality intelligence that relies on a strong satellite network system. The Air Force views the technological opportunity of this strategic area through the improvement of small satellites, in which the current assets are expensive and sometimes lack persistence and reliability. Small satellites are being equipped with additional capabilities that often involve deployable structures, such as solar arrays, antennas, and other equipment. Failures to deploy these systems in space are some of the most common types of satellite failures. We propose to use advanced structural materials, bulk metallic glasses (BMG), and novel thermoplastic forming processes (TPF) to fabricate superior hinges for satellite applications. The planned R&D work in this project includes development of TPF fabrication process for BMG hinges and benchmarking properties against high-strain composites currently used in this application. BMGs received a lot of attention, but challenges with producing consistent, defect-free products hampered their use. Supercool Metals has developed processing methods that allow fabrication of BMG components for a variety of applications, including satellite components. TPF of BMGs is a unique metal forming technology that allows to produce components using BMG materials with high precision, complexity, consistency, uniform properties and a wide range of geometries. Incumbent solutions use composite-based hinges that suffer from delamination issues and have poor fatigue properties. BMG hinges are expected to have higher reliability, light weight and superior performance compared to incumbent solutions due to higher strength, elasticity and improved fatigue behavior, among other properties. In addition, current designs of hinges are limited by the nature of the materials and their manufacturing techniques. As an additional benefit, the BMG technology can produce hinges with more efficient engineering designs. The BMG hinges can be easily integrated into deployable components of satellites, similar to current hinges, and deployed through the same methods of heat activation or mechanical release. A combination of BMG properties and unique TPF processing methods enables high-performance products, as already demonstrated by Supercool Metals in other areas, such as robotics components. Use of BMG hinges is expected to eliminate many deployable issues and significantly improve satellite reliability for the Air Force customers and commercial satellite users. ",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Evgenia  Pekarskaya,,(203) 823-9032,evgenia@supercoolmetals.com,,  ,

This is significant to the military for several reasons, because these two sources currently interfere with logistical supply of O2 to where it is required, namely field hospital units. PSA units reportedly have limited shelf life and supply O2 at less than the desired 99% (typically, 93% maximum). These limitations in turn drives up costs as well as threaten the survival of wounded warfighters.

This advanced method for extracting O2 from a flow stream of ambient air meets and exceeds military requirements for medical O2.

The primary goal of congestion control is to avoid congestion overload on the network while effectively utilizing the available transmission capacity for reliable end-to-end (e2e) transport. Congestion control in today’s Internet is overwhelmingly based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) at the transport layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack. Many versions of TCP congestion control/avoidance methods have been researched and implemented over the years to achieve optimized performance. Although many of these versions served well in many cases, the emergence of new Internet applications (e.g., large-scale data transfer, replication, backup, real-time AR/VR communications, etc.) as well as very-high-speed communication (e.g., optical) links require innovative ideas to further enhance the transport-layer protocol. Many transport protocols try to optimize congestion-control algorithms by operating the congestion window in a range which maximizes inflight data. Some of these algorithms are based on loss rate, some are based on round-trip delays, and a recent one from Google is congestion based. Various studies show the shortcomings of these approaches in different scenarios. Thus, transport-layer congestion control needs an intelligent and dynamic evolution to support next-generation, high-throughput applications over e2e network paths with a wide range of network conditions (e.g., various packet-loss rates and/or Round-Trip Times (RTTs)). [Note that these e2e paths can include not only high-speed network links (with low or negligible loss rates) but also low-quality (i.e., lossy) access links.] Also, innovations on transport layer should be related to the TCP/IP stack, so that new solutions are backward-compatible. Accordingly, Ennetix is developing an experimental transport protocol, called Intelligent Transport Proto- col (ITP), which employs multiple learn-and-infer techniques (based on Machine Learning (ML)) in congestion control and network coding for forward-error correction at the transport layer (as traditional acknowledgement- based backward-error correction is too slow for high-throughput applications). ITP operates the congestion window at optimal level by estimating and inferring parameters based on historical data using ML techniques. ITP reduces (i.e., masks over) e2e loss rate (even if it is high) at transport stack by intelligently employing (a) network coding and (b) buffer management by predicting parameters based on estimated network conditions, thereby leading to a more linear response to changes in loss rate and RTT. During Phase I of this SBIR project, requirements analysis and design of the ITP platform architecture were conducted, a working prototype was developed, and evaluation studies have been performed to determine ITP’s performance and feasibility to support the ultra-fast transport requirements of the next generation of Internet applications. These feasibility and performance evaluation studies have been accomplished over live networks at Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Ennetix office. Outcomes of the Phase I R&D efforts and evaluation studies have confirmed the viability of ITP as a commercial-grade transport-protocol platform. In this Phase II project (as a continuation of Phase I), the goal is to significantly expand ITP with advanced performance models and forecasting methods in congestion-control algorithms, scalable and intel- ligent network coding, and programmable interfaces for extensibility. A commercial-grade ITP solution will be developed, with which network operators can build networking infrastructures for the next-generation Internet. Early field trials will demonstrate the functionalities and performance of ITP over live networks and pave the way for successful market entry and deployment on premier R&E networks such as ESnet. ITP will greatly benefit network users at DOE and other government organizations through an innova- tive transport protocol which will provide much higher throughput in today’s cloud-based, dynamic, and distributed environments with various RTTs and loss rates. The wider benefits of this effort will extend well beyond the immediate DOE scientific community, and on to common Internet users, other enterprises, and service providers. In particular, many commercial cloud-service providers and enterprises can leverage ITP to implement new use cases and support the next generations of Internet applications.",  ,,,,Pulak  Chowdhury,,(530) 574-7084,pulak@ennetix.com,,  ,

Since the qubits are rapidly randomized by noise from the environment and thus lose coherence, NISQ devices are inherently susceptible to generating errors during computation. These devices operate under open-loop control without the benefit of error correction that is critical for their reliable operation. To meet this challenge, it is imperative to employ the best control design resources to assure that gate operations are performed at the highest fidelity while simultaneously being robust to inevitable uncertainties in device fabrication as well as noise from various sources. To this end, we are developing an integrated software product for control, characterization, calibration and optimization of quantum computers to address the above-mentioned fragility. The proposed STTR program will draw from the vast library of quantum control algorithms and software for control optimization and characterization developed at Princeton University and SC Solutions, Inc. (SC) in order to create an integrated set of software tools to meet the dual objectives of (a) computational design of reliable control and calibration for NISQ devices, and (b) guiding their fabrication and implementation. In Phase I, the SC-Princeton team has established the feasibility of developing a fully functional software framework which would allow the quantum researcher to perform software-guided control, calibration, optimization, and characterization in simulation and on quantum hardware. Through extensive interviews with potential customers from industry and university research laboratories, the team identified their needs to guide our software requirements. We have designed the software framework to be modular in order to enhance flexibility and increase the utility of the tools. Several representative algorithms for robust control optimization, calibration, and characterization have demonstrated the use of some common protocols defining only a few of the possible pathways to achieve the performance goals. The aim of the Phase II effort is to develop the software product prototype which can be interfaced with various NISQ systems. This software will accelerate the achievement of optimal performance while drawing upon the best features of the computational control design and experimental implementation in a real-time iterative fashion.The software toolset will consider the particular characteristics of each device, including the presence of often unknown error sources. The commercial product resulting from the Phase II effort will integrate the control, optimization, calibration, and characterization software tools into modules that will seamlessly interconnect and have a user-friendly interface. The software may be used for both off-line simulations and in experimental applications in a synergistic fashion. It will relieve quantum hardware developers from the burden of designing and implementing their own in-house quantum control and optimization software.

Detection of individual charged particles and photons and estimation of their properties is the basis for a wide range of scientific and commercial applications from high-energy, nuclear, and astrophysics to medical imaging and diagnosis and LiDAR. We are targeting the data acquisition market for medium to large scientific experiments in the energy or intensity frontiers. These complex experiments require hundreds to thousands of recording channels at high samplings speed and high rates capable of fast data acquisition and signal processing. The HDSoC allows for timing resolutions on the order of 100s of picoseconds, translating to highly accurate estimates of charged particles and their tracks. Low cost, low power designs are especially attractive for experiments with thousands of recording channels. We propose to design and make commercially available the “HDSoC”: a low-cost, low-power, high-density waveform sampling chip capable of analog signal conditioning, fast waveform sampling, and integrated readout.

Reliably quantifying measurement uncertainties is fundamentally important for scientific measurements and DOE has identified a need for improved field portable calibration systems. The calibration of aerosol mass spectrometers that respond to chemically specific aerosol mass require introduction of known calibrant aerosol levels. Currently there is no way to provide fixed mass delivery of aerosols but instead rely on sampling distributions of generated calibration particles that are sized and counted to estimate the delivered mass to the recipient instrument. This approach has multiple sources of uncertainty related to physical properties unrelated to mass. The proposed device builds on the well-established method of drug delivery- the meter dose inhaler or atomizer- that was developed specifically to deliver fixed mass doses. This project will develop an aerosol chemical calibration device to (1) deliver scalable quantities of aerosol of known composition with high mass precision, (2) be suitable for organic and inorganic species and for compound mixtures, (3) minimize consumption of solvents and standards, (4) remain sufficiently clean to handle mass spectrometer level sensitivities without contaminant interference and (5) be packaged in a fully automated compact, field portable system. In the Phase I effort, a prototype system was developed and tested for efficiency and reliability of delivering ammonium nitrate, the primary calibrant compound for the most common aerosol mass spectrometer instruments. The prototype demonstrated near 100% mass delivery efficiency with a variability under 10%. During Phase II, the calibration system will be tested on commercial grade aerosol mass spectrometers and the range of calibration compounds will be extended to include all major chemical classes of atmospheric aerosols. The proposed aerosol calibrator will improve quantification accuracy in measuring a wide range of chemically resolved aerosols. Many atmospheric aerosol properties of interest currently measured (e.g. optical scattering and absorption, cloud or ice formation potential) depend on chemical composition. Therefore, indirect benefits would be obtained by reducing measurement uncertainties with mass spectrometer based instruments. This new calibration approach could additionally serve as a new benchmark standard by which to evaluate a wide spectrum of aerosol instrumentation. The three broad technology classes of aerosol samplers, generators or control systems would all potentially benefit from such an improved means of standardized delivery of calibration aerosol.",  ,,,,Nathan  Kreisberg,,(510) 649-9360,nathan@aerosol.us,,  ,

Currently available systems are an order of magnitude too slow, require severely limited beam intensity, and present huge challenges with the massive amounts of data they deliver to the user’s computer. Addressing these issues requires a new strategy for data collection and processing. Building on our successful Phase I work, we propose to continue the development and commercialization of a new edge-computing electron counting camera that takes advantage of a novel sparse, binary-readout direct electron sensor that we have successfully developed and fabricated. Instead of the conventional brute- force imaging approach to electron counting used by existing cameras, our strategy is to record detection events on the sensor and then perform electron counting operations in hardware located in the camera head, thereby relieving associated computer resources for processing such high-speed data. In Phase I, we successfully operated a prototype camera, demonstrating the low-noise, high-sensitivity, and high-dynamic-range performance of our new sensor and proving our edge-computing strategy for electron counting. In Phase II, we will improve performance by refining our edge-computing electron counting algorithm to improve performance, further boost framerate by applying lossless compression in hardware/firmware, integrate the new camera in user-focused data acquisition software, and synchronize data acquisition with data from state-of-the-art third-party in situ specimen holders. The resulting commercialized system will provide a 16-megapixel camera system, delivering continuous real- time streaming with significantly higher dynamic range, less noise, and higher frame rate than any currently- available TEM camera. This will be a tremendous benefit for multi-dimensional electron microscopy in private, public, and national laboratories working in a wide variety of fields. Microscopists will be able to take advantage of recent and upcoming advances in TEM instrumentation by capturing high-speed specimen dynamics, and doing so without the exposure rate constraints imposed by conventional electron counting cameras. Removing the camera as a limiting factor for TEM imaging will make it indispensable for a wide variety of TEM techniques, including high-speed continuous tilt tomography, in situ microscopy, and cryo-EM of both materials and biological specimens. liquid helium temperature.",  ,,,,Benjamin  Bammes,,(858) 384-0291,bbammes@directelectron.com,,  ,

These high precision instruments require careful alignment and calibration, which is a slow, error prone process that wastes precious time and beam availability resources. The goal of this project is to create rapid beamline modeling tools that may be combined with the diagnostics data in real time to construct an “online model” that will improve the beamline operator’s knowledge of the photon beam and enable automated alignment and reconfiguration. The recently developing Bluesky software used to run beamline experiments will be combined with rapidly executing beamline models and diagnostics data to build the continually updated online model. During Phase I of this project, we constructed a variety of rapid x-ray transport models using both first principles and machine learning. The physics models adapted transfer matrix methods in conjunction with Wigner function methods to represent partially coherent radiation, an important property of the x-ray beams in these light source facilities. We also integrated these tools with our existing web-based Graphical User Interfaces for SHADOW and SRW. In Phase II, we will complete the construction of the rapid x-ray transport and machine learning models and apply this to operating beamlines at a synchrotron light source. In collaboration with our subcontract, we will expand the Bluesky software that already operates on these beamlines to include the rapid optics models and our machine learning methods. This technology will dramatically increase the efficiency of x-ray beamlines, reducing the time needed to set up new experiments, and to optimize beamline performance.

Data complexity results in significant “dark data” that eludes analysis by researchers and business analysts, resulting in lost opportunities for discovery and the failure to fully leverage costly data collection efforts. Due to such data’s structural and/or processing complexity, machine learning remains difficult to integrate across multiple length and time scales, and across multi-domain science problems. The project will create and evaluate a novel platform for the flexible application of diverse machine learning methods and tools across a broad range of scientific disciplines as well as across diverse engineering, business, and public sector domains. The platform will enhance data management and analysis to make it easier to apply machine learning analytic methods across multi- scale/multi-physics problems that involve data of high volume, variety and velocity of growth and change. Expert domain specialists on the project will help to conduct proof-of-concepts evaluations in environmental science, computational chemistry, advanced materials and commercial exemplars. We seek here to deliver two key innovations: 1) creating workflow tools that enhance and simplify machine learning methods on complex data, and 2) enabling those workflows to quickly react and adapt to changes in the content and structure of datasets, models and workflow scripts. The project will make the resulting machine-learning-driven analysis platform available to biological, environmental and energy research communities across Department of Energy labs and facilities. In phase 2 we will further develop these capabilities with development and innovation in the systems, security, scaling and user interface areas. In Phase I, we prototyped innovations in the core dataflow model of machine learning computational processes, and in the management of data inputs, outputs and changes (the “evolution” of schema, data and programs). We evaluated the innovations on problems in four areas: chemistry, biochemistry (for Covid therapeutics), river ecology/hydrology systems, building energy modeling and prediction, and touched on tools for applying machine learning to data analysis problems in materials. In Phase II we will evaluate and guide the development of these machine learning workflow innovations by applying them to three problems in DOE mission science: environmental modeling of river biogeochemistry; chemical modeling of atomic and molecular force fields and free energy; and the discovery of advanced energy materials through multi-database analysis. We will also test the innovations on two domains representing promising commercial applications: precision agriculture and the industrial internet-of-things applied to building energy modeling and management.

We have demonstrated the feasibility of the SMART-CAM product by working on selected activities under goals #1, #2, and #3.The initial prototype can run successfullyon 32 nodes with 32 Bluefield-2 adapters and up to 1,024 MPI processes for a set of representativeMPI applications. Initial customer engagements with the prototype product have takenplacewith various organizations including NVIDIA/Mellanox, Broadcom, LANL, NSSC-Singapore, and UO. These customers are enthusiastic about using the new product (please see attached letters) to accelerate their HPC and DL applications with SMART-CAM. We aim to build on top of the success of Phase-I to build the complete SMART-CAM product while primarily focusing on the major goals (4, 5, 6, 7, and 8), remaining partsof the other goals, in-depth Q&A testing, and commercialization. The transformative impact of SMART-CAM will be to achieve extreme scalability and performance for HPC and DL frameworks/applications while taking advantage of SMART NICs. SMART-CAM can reduce the CPU utilization of popular communication middleware by up to 30%, resulting in a significant boost to application-level performance by making more CPU time available to it. The acceleration of communication and I/O operations made possible by the NVMeoF technology introduced by Bluefield/Stingray smart NICs can reduce the I/O processing time by a factor of up to 5 for I/O intensive workloads like DL training. Furthermore, the availability of programmable ARM cores on the Bluefield/Stingray SoC can reduce the processing overhead for activities like datatype processing, data compression, and collective communication by up to a factor of 3 for HPC and DL applications.",  ,,,,Donglai  Dai,,(614) 316-4209,d.dai@x-scalesolutions.com,,  ,

Unfortunately, robust thermodynamic HTRE for this challenging application are not commercially available which inhibits the development and deployment of next-generation, molten-salt-cooled, high-temperature nuclear reactors. The HiFunda/INL/UofU team is proposing to leverage HiFunda’s Phase I electrochemical sensor and materials development and INL’s and UofU’s high- temperature molten salt electrochemical testing, first principles and thermodynamic experiences to develop and demonstrate new robust HTRE designs that meet the thermal, chemical, mechanical, electrical, manufacturability, cost, and reliability requirements for this demanding high-temperature molten salt application. The HiFunda/INL/UofU team is proposing to build upon the Phase I results to further develop and demonstrate a HTRE specifically designed and engineered for the high-temperature molten fluoride salt application. Robust thermodynamic HTRE designs that utilize a Ni/Ni(II) or Ag/Ag (I) couple with controlled porosity frits and robust seals will be established. HTRE material compatibility, seal performance, and electrochemical performance will be evaluated in molten fluoride salts as a function of time and temperature. Cost models will be established to identify cost drivers and to evaluate trade-offs between HTRE design, performance, and cost. A detailed commercialization plan will be developed and potential commercialization partners will be identified for participation in Phase II. The proposed approach will help to enable next-generation nuclear power generation which will have a significant positive effect on power generation and CO2 emissions in the US and worldwide. Reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and increasing the supply of energy produced from nuclear fuels will have an enormous impact on US energy security and US energy demand with abundant emission-free electricity.

This data deluge can lead to advances in science and engineering only if matched by data management solutions that tackle the problem of handling massive repositories while reducing time spent moving data, reducing costs, and enabling discoveries and decisions. This project aims at generalizing and commercializing the VisStore solution for integrating commodity storage with existing cloud and HPC cyberinfrastructure. In particular, the VisStore layer creates added value to existing storage solutions with a cache-oblivious approach that integrates external, distributed memories in an environment that is not only highly scalable but also easy to use by providing dire integration with existing working environments through Python, C, R, and Java. Overall, the proposed approach will reduce data bottlenecks while working within user workflows for data analysis, authentication requirements, and device diagnostic requirements, enabling us to develop software connecting a broad range of devices to our solution for a vast number of smaller engineering and science labs. Phase I accomplishments demonstrate the ability to support the development and deployment of accessible storage di- rectly connected to the data source, allowing the seamless blend between cloud and local data access for devices such as those at Large-Scale Experimental facilities, and ensure preliminary integration of existing workflows through Python. Phase I tested VisStore integration for high-energy x-ray tomography (CT) and high-energy x-ray diffraction microscopy at Argonne, integrated our framework to solve problems for handling massive dataset sizes in our technology partners at Lawrence Livermore National labs’ LLNL Tomography Toolkit (LTT), and using VisStore hardware and software to monitor, acquire, and live stream neuron data at the University of Utah. Phase II will need to address the risks further, including generalizing the ingestion of incoming data on the fly as well as handling easy and secure deployment, data management, and data sharing. VisStore will impact the economics of scientific processing of data by reducing the time and cost of handling massive imagery, which can, in turn, accelerate scientific discovery and the development of new products and services. For instance, contributing to our understanding of the human brain will have a long-lasting impact on society and improve our quality of life. Several extensions of the technology for use in material science and climate data exploration will also have an evident broader societal impact. Engineers and analysts can save hours of work due to streamlining workflows by removing the arduous step of manually managing and moving data.

However, due to the need to avoid electrical breakdown between neighboring pixel, conventional LGADs include inter-pixel isolation structures that limit the granularity to the 1x1 mm2 scale. Here, we propose the continue development of the Deep Junction LGAD (DJ- LGAD), a novel approach that will allow segmentation at the 10x10 µm2 scale while maintaining the precise timing resolution characteristic of LGADs. In the DJ-LGAD approach, a highly- doped junction is formed several microns below the surface of the sensor, isolating the high-field gain region from the surface electrode structure, and thus avoiding electrical breakdown between electrodes without the inclusion of inter-pixel termination structures. Two fabrication techniques to form the deep junction will be explored at the lead company (Cactus Materials): wafer-to- wafer bonding and epitaxial growth. During Phase-I work, a program of TCAD simulation was undertaken that allowed the conceptual DJ-LGAD idea to be developed into a fabricable planar (non-segmented) device with a stable buried junction. Fabrication parameters, including implantation dose and incidence angle, junction termination geometry (including guard-ring structure), annealing parameters, and junction width and depth, were established by the simulation studies. Preliminary fabrication results suggest that both wafer bonding and epitaxy are viable approach to fabricate the devices. Wafer bonding technique would be a transformational technology as it can enable detectors with dissimilar materials (III-V) along with silicon materials. I-V measurement from Phase I results suggest interface between wafers are electrically conductive. Further study is in progress to fabricate a fully planar DJ-LGAD device by the end of Phase I. The Phase-II project will build on this, refining the wafer-to-wafer bonding approach and developing the epitaxial method. TCAD simulation studies will be used to extend the planar design of the Phase-I prototype to a fully granular design, which will then be fabricated and characterized with X-ray and proton beams. Commercialization strategies will also be developed. Applications within the realm of pure science include 4D and next-generation silicon strip tracking for further exploration of the fundamental building blocks of the universe and the structure and behavior of nuclear matter.

The unique spouted bed reactor, developed by Advanced Cooling Technologies, Inc. (ACT) is the key innovation that increased performance of thermal desorption of mercury and other contaminants from coal. In addition, dewatering using supercritical CO2 will be applied to assist high-moisture lignite and anthracite. For soil remediation, ACT will collaborate with Lehigh University and commercial partners, to investigate supercritical CO2 dewatering and thermal desorption using spouted bed to remove contaminants from soil at one of EPA’s Superfund sites. In Phase II, ACT designed and fabricated a unique spouted bed reactor to improve particle mixing and heat transfer within the coal bed. The thermal desorption process using ACT’s spouted bed design demonstrated a reduction of 65% Mercury, 28% Sulfur, 43% Arsenic, and 45% Lead content in bituminous coal, which doubled the removal efficiency compared to standard conical spouted bed. Thermal desorption of Lignite and Anthracite was not as effective due to excessive moisture content and irregular shape. ACT in collaboration with Lehigh University and industrial partners, will improve its spouted bed reactor design to remove contaminants from all types of coal, including high-moisture Lignite and Anthracite.

There is an acute need in this field to select individual particle bunches from within a beam and ”kick” them onto a different trajectory using pulsed electromagnetic fields. The time frames associated with these operations can be too brief for semiconductor switches that require several nanoseconds to turn on, and several nanoseconds to turn off. This SBIR project is investigating a new approach to create brief kicking pulses by superimposing harmonic radio waves within a harmonically resonant kicking cavity. Two types of fast multi-harmonic kicker cavities are being developed by our collaboration. One will produce transverse kicks at 86.6 MHz and one will produce longitudinal kicks at 499 MHz. The transverse kicker will directly influence the trajectory of bunches within the beam, and the longitudinal kicker will use magnetic separation of selectively boosted bunches. This ultimate goal of this SBIR is to experimentally evaluate both kicking solutions on a beamline. The Phase I project, and efforts at Jlab, have established a solid foundation for achieving this goal. A beamline compatible transverse cavity is currently being assembled, once complete; it is ready for beamline evaluation at the start of Phase II. This is because its high power harmonic driver, originally a Phase II goal, was completed in Phase I. Phase I also developed longitudinal kicker cavities, a high power harmonic combiner technology, and a new type of harmonic synthesizer. Phase II will begin with beamline testing of the 86.6 MHz transverse kicker.A vacuum compatible longitudinal kicker cavity and its high power harmonic driver will be constructed and also beamline tested during Phase II.This new kicking technology has immediate and future needs in particle acceleration, including at Fermilab’s Project X where protons could be sent to several experiments simultaneously, and at the LCLS at SLAC where fast beam switching kickers could be used to operate multiple wigglers at near CW repetition rates.

Currently used GS20 glass scintillator works well but cannot provide the desired resolution performance due to its low brightness. A bright, fast, high spatial resolution scintillator will improve the spatial resolution and throughput of the single crystal diffractometer at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. We propose to address the limitations of GS20 by using an advanced scintillator, made in a large area, microcolumnar film format that heretofore was not possible to grow because of the extreme hygroscopic nature of the material. This choice is based on the known high brightness of the material, which emits a relatively low number of photons/MeV gamma, but is expected to yield as many as 50,000 to 100,000 photons per thermal neutron interaction, a factor ~8 to 16 times higher yield than current GS20 glass. The high thermal neutron efficiency of this material implies that only ~1.0 mm of scintillator thickness is needed to absorb about 60% of 1Å neutrons. The very thinness of the scintillator helps significantly in discriminating against gammas by minimizing the probability of both photoelectric absorption and light conversion efficiency for gammas. Finally, one of the key innovative approaches we plan to pursue is to realize large-area scintillators. In the Phase I, RMD Inc. used physical vapor deposition to make screens of scintillation material, as well as dope or co-dope the material with divalent or trivalent ions to improve the speed. The entire deposition and sealing process was carried out in a moisture free atmosphere using a newly developed technique at RMD. The spatial resolution for neutrons was estimated as less than 300 µm, with better than 1x10-6 gamma rejection, and 60% neutron absorption efficiency. In the Phase II, RMD Inc. will maximize the light output by optimizing the dopant concentration, and scale- up deposition to large sizes. Additionally, we will protect the scintillator from moisture using a unique conformal coating, and a new type of hermetic sealing. The efficacy of the scintillator will be demonstrated at ORNL with less than 300 µm spatial resolution when coupled to the detector, ~1x10-7 gamma rejection and 60% neutron absorption efficiency for a 1 mm thick scintillator screen. The scintillator will be coupled to the existing pixelated readout and the detector will be delivered to ORNL for immediate use. RMD’s scintillator/detector will be an excellent choice for neutron detectors for any facility that runs neutron experiments. For example, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, large-area detectors at the Spallation Neutron Source are used for neutron scattering experiments and in materials research for a variety of applications. Including the U.S. facilities, there are 45 neutron research centers located around the world that will want to take advantage of our technology.",  ,,,,Matthew  Marshall,,(617) 668-6923,mmarshall@rmdinc.com,,  ,

Presently, no field- deployable research instrumentation exists for long-term monitoring of plant/microbial interactions. Potentiometric (open-circuit voltage) measurements have been developed as an analytical technique for understanding plant/microbial interactions. The simplicity of the analytical technique allows the deployment of large arrays of sensors throughout the environment (plants, roots, soils).Instrumentation and methods were developed using large arrays of sensors (>200 sensors) to measure the potentials generated by biofilms throughout the structures of a plant (rhizosphere, stems and leaves) over a period of several months. The data generated by the instrumentation was used to create visualizations (3D and 4D) of the charge transfer between the structures of a plant, and its surrounding soils. Refinements will be made to the instrumentation and visualization capability combined with machine learning algorithms to allow the modeling the factors impacting the plant/microbial interactions. It is anticipated the models will lead to predictive tools capable of optimizing the production of biomass.

Nuclear Physics (NP) end users have a growing need for particle tracking devices with 1) improved tracking and timing resolution, 2) faster speed to limit event pileup, 3) lower mass detector to minimize electron scattering, leakage, and trapping distance, 4) better substrate depletion to reduce collection time, 5) high radiation tolerance, and 6) lower power and lower fabrication cost. NHanced proposes to develop a low mass 3D-Advanced Hybrid Sensor (AHS) that will achieve picosecond timing resolutions and micrometer scale spatial resolution. The device will also provide angular resolution within a single layer detector – no other existing technology can do this. We propose to use our in-house 3D assembly technology (DBI®) to integrate a fast ReadOut IC (ROIC) tier to an ultra- low mass particle detector tier that will be fabricated in our wholly-owned fab in NC. Our 3D technology allows us to connect any type of detector to our ROIC in LEGO®-like fashion, creating a family of products to serve a wide variety of applications relevant to NP end users: low material, low mass sensors with excellent timing and tracking capabilities. Our proposed product and technology enable us to achieve performances that outrun all competing technologies on almost every aspect. Our product offers timing resolution performance similar to LGAD, but without its radiation tolerance limitations, and spatial resolution similar to SOI-MAPS/MAPS without its dead time, slow readout speed, or charge drifts. This effort led to extremely encouraging results. Our 3D technology allows us to connect any type of sensor to our ROIC. With that in mind, we performed twenty 3D-AHS prototype configurations including ten detector versions (five thicknesses and two pixel sizes) and four ROIC versions. We successfully demonstrated our capability to integrate a fast ROIC with ultra-low mass, fully depleted detectors, thus allowing excellent timing and tracking capabilities. Some prototype design versions demonstrated ultra- low power consumption – potentially low enough that slow air flow cooling could be used, thus further reducing the overall mass of the whole system. Our technology primarily targets the silicon sensors commonly used for industry, medicine, and research science. The world market for silicon photosensors is expected to exceed $17 billion by 2022. The market niche for non-visual sensors accounts for about 1-2% of that, with a comfortable growth of +5% CAGR over the next 5 years. We estimate the market portion that would benefit from our technology to be roughly $170M in 2022.",  ,,,,Robert  Patti,,(630) 561-6813,rpatti@nhanced-semi.com,,  ,

We propose to adapt real-time coherent combining software for electronically steered arrays recently proven for ground-to-space communications to the computing constraints of small spacecraft. An electronically steered array antenna system must adjust the phase of multiple received signals so they coherently combine, with errors in the process rapidly degrading the output signal. The chief method of mitigating phase errors is to place the radio antenna elements into a robust, high precision mechanical structure. On a moving platform, another mitigation is also used, precise measurements of movement and/or cessation of all movement during antenna usage. The first is at direct odds with the need for small spacecraft to use lightweight, flexible, and deployable structures. The second is an extreme challenge for orbiting craft, especially those navigating in CisLunar or deep space where relative position knowledge is degraded compared to LEO satellite situations.Miles Spacersquo;s coherent combining software continuously adapts to phase differences in radio data streams allowing them to be combined successfully, nearly eliminating grating lobes. Doing so allows flexible, deployable antennas to be used on rotating craft, even those that may have residual antenna vibration due to recent propulsion and attitude control usage. There are corresponding cost and risk reductions in craft mass and machining tolerances with improved tolerance to deployment mechanism issues and on-mission antenna damage.Through a contract with ATLAS Space Operations, Miles Space demonstrated to the US Air Force its coherent combining software operating on a phased array ground terminal downlinking GEO and LEO satellite signals. The algorithm was used on digitized RF data before the data reached a commercial modem for decoding.

Small footprint devices are needed to make in situ, nondestructive, functional, and quantitative measurement independent of large, expensive instruments. These must also be affordable, deployable, and accessible to the larger scientific community. An affordable, low footprint digital holographic microscope will be built to satisfy the stated measurement requirement by exploiting unique features of holography, to remove key limitations in existing bioimaging systems and enable imaging and measuring key metabolic processes within and among microbial cells and multicellular plant tissues. Digital holograms can now be recorded on small, lightweight sensor arrays at video rates, processed in real time, and offer the many advantages associated with digital media, transferring much of the overall optical process into electronics and software. A hologram records all optical information in a light wave scattered from, transmitted through, or reflected from a biological surface of interest, enabling dynamic, microscopic imaging over large fields of view and depths of field with a relatively small instrument, capabilities that cannot be achieved with conventional imaging devices. Phase I demonstrated, experimentally and theoretically, the capability of digital holographic microscopy to record and measure typical critical parameters of biological cells, their movements, and changes in time, employing a flexible and controllable simulated biological system to refine, qualify, and characterize the measurement system and identify critical issues. Phase II will include constructing a refined portable digital holographic system and software initiated during Phase I and research on live biological samples and rhizosphere problems with a team consisting of microbiologists that are actively involved in this field. The system potential in biological research will be demonstrated and compared with conventional imaging tools. Digital holographic microscopy should have significant applications in industrial processes and biological research, where speed is at a particularly high premium. As an example, the semiconductor industry is a particularly attractive target.

Soil moisture content is a key state variable in subsurface hydrobiogeochemical processes, but soil moisture flux is an equally important process variable for which there is currently no practical means of measurement.

Achieving high-quality science at nuclear physics facilities requires the measurement of particle energy with excellent calorimeter energy resolution in the momentum range 0.1 – (10-20) GeV/c. Crystals such as lead tungstate (PbWO4) have been used in precision calorimeters but their production is slow and expensive. This Phase I/II project addresses the need for alternative high performance scintillator materials by developing the basis to replace such crystals with scintillating glass that is simpler and faster to produce in large quantities while meeting the desired specifications. Phase I established the fabrication techniques for lab scale production (10-20 blocks) of scintillating glass (SciGlass) with reproducible optical properties and dimensions up to ~10 radiation lengths. Initial measurements with R&D prototypes at particle beam colliders along with simulations indicate that SciGlass has an energy resolution comparable to PbWO4 for block sizes of a comparable number of radiation lengths. The glass samples have excellent optical properties and radiation resistance (no damage up to 1000 Gy electromagnetic and 1015 n/cm2 hadron irradiation, the highest doses tested to date), response time of 20-50 ns, and good transmittance in the near UV domain (78% at 440 nm). The SciGlass insensitivity to temperature is another clear advantage over PbWO4, which has a dependence of about 2-3%/°C and has to be continuously monitored. The feasibility for scaling up the size was demonstrated with the production of 2 x 2 x 40 cm3 blocks. Phase II will establish the new SciGlass developed in Phase I as an electromagnetic calorimeter through definite energy resolution measurements in a particle test beam including a suitable light read-out system. Production capability for larger numbers of uniform SciGlass will be developed to meet the need of large-volume nuclear physics electromagnetic calorimeters. A second objective of Phase II is to demonstrate the production of different SciGlass shapes, e.g., for application in detector barrel regions. The Phase II program is aligned to make SciGlass blocks available to meet the needs of key nuclear physics experiments, e.g., the large-volume calorimeters for the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) or JLab, that require high performance scintillator material in large quantities on specific schedules. Other SciGlass benefits include reduced time and complexity of manufacturing, resulting in an estimated 80% cost reduction, and increased flexibility in shape and size for the final detector. The ability to manufacture novel high-performance glass scintillators will prove useful not only for electromagnetic calorimeters but also for homeland security applications where such scintillators would significantly reduce the false alarm rate in passive nuclear detection systems and allow for large range of deployment. Fast response time and radiation hard glass ceramics will find use in the scintillator market for security applications as active material for radiation portal monitors, in particular, at ports where cargo screening with large throughput is required.",  ,,,,Tanja  Horn,,(757) 912-1728,horn@scintilex.com,Catholic University of America,  ,

The developments in these architectures have been driven by machine learning/artificial intelligence applications where lower precision computing is frequently used. To properly leverage these advanced architectures, scientific computing algorithms must be able to utilize lower precision computing without sacrificing the needed levels of accuracy. This project seeks to use these lower precision calculations specifically applied to high fidelity, multi-physics flow simulations (e.g., noise, turbulent combustion, convective heat transfer). Progress to date has shown that targeted use of lower precision computing with algorithmic modifications can replicate acceptable levels of accuracy for problems involving turbine blade heat transfer, high speed jet noise, and other problems where subtle flow phenomena (e.g., aeroacoustics, laminar-turbulent transition, boundary layer separation) need to be predicted. These improvements have had significant impact on throughput as well enabling computations on lower cost graphics processing units. Additional work is proposed to make similar algorithmic improvements for a wider class of multi- physics flows including particle-laden turbulent flows and liquid fueled combustion processes. Proposed work will also continue the validation of these approaches against available experimental data. Successful completion of this work scope would establish theoretical and empirical justification on the viability of reduced precision operations for high fidelity flow simulations. The deployment of these mixed precision algorithms will significantly reduce the cost of high fidelity flow simulation allowing more commercial use of these tools in the engineering design process.",  ,,,,Frank  Ham,,(510) 861-5630,ham@cascadetechnologies.com,,  ,

Lack of highly conductive ionomers and polymer electrolyte membranes with superior mechanical robustness and permeation limit the application of solar fuels technology. This project’s goal is to develop a new type of visible light transparent polymer with the aromatic backbone structure with high performance and good durability for CO2 electroreduction. A series of crosslinked polymer electrolyte membranes will be fabricated in order to suppress the CO2 plasticization, swelling behavior, gas crossover, and improve mechanical durability. The new ionomers and membranes will then be tested in a CO2 electrolyzer. Results of characterization and performance tests will provide feedback and guide development in large scale production. The novel integration of aromatic backbone polymer and crosslinker will provide a viable solution to fabricate a large area polymer electrolyte membrane and ensure durable performance in solar fuel production. Utilizing low-cost and abundant solar energy to covert CO2 to fuel and value-added chemicals could positively impact the global carbon balance, reduce air pollution, and create new jobs in regions with few opportunities by distributing production of these materials.

The method being pursued at Brookhaven Nation Laboratory’s (BNL) EIC is based on coherent electron cooling (CeC) with a high bunch-charge Energy Recovery Linac (ERL). In Phase I, Xelera Research LLC worked closely with both BNL and Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) teams to study multiple concepts for the critical merger and arc sections of a high bunch charge ERL. These sections were designed using comprehensive modeling and global numerical optimization to suppress the detrimental effects of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) and space charge (SC). The Xelera team also began to develop a complete start-to-end design to set the stage for the Phase II project. In Phase II, we will partner with BNL scientists to develop complete ERL designs suitable for production use. The first year of the project will focus on the beam dynamics designs, including designs for the injector, merger, multi-pass Linac, merger into the cooling section, demerger into the return line (which includes 180-degree arcs), and final extraction of the energy recovered beam. These activities will blend into relevant beam dynamics studies in the second year, including beam breakup (BBU) simulations, tolerance studies, start-to-end simulations, and beam halo studies. A successful Phase II collaboration will establish Xelera Research LLC as an accelerator design and consulting firm that national labs and industry can reliably utilize for new projects. For example, an ERL-based Free Electron Laser (FEL) is considered to be a potential future path for a EUV lithography light source, and this project would position us to break into that industry.

Neither DOE neutron scattering user facilities nor international facilities offer such a sample environment on neutron reflectometers necessary for the scientific community to develop molecular structure-property relationships for complex fluid interfaces. We propose to develop a world-leading sample environment for neutron reflectometry and integrate complementary characterization techniques such as interfacial rheology, Brewster angle microscopy and particle image velocimetry. Utilizing these techniques will enable the complete characterization of complex interfaces on all length scales (Ångstrom- nano-micro-macro) alongside surface moduli measurements that enables elucidation of novel molecular structure-property relationships at interfaces. A minimum viable protype was successfully designed and constructed. A quad- motor system with software to control interfacial deformation was designed and validated. Further, a neutron transparent band for interface containment and control was engineered to permit simultaneous interfacial rheological and neutron reflectivity measurements. Control over sample thermodynamic state has been demonstrated using a stable, fast-responding environmental chamber. Finally, commercialization paths and potential customers were identified for rapid commercialization after Phase II. The Phase I RheoSurfRTM prototype will be improved upon to optimize performance and minimize costs and complexity. Control systems will be improved and simplified, while maintaining high- level accuracy and precision. Complementary interfacial characterization capabilities will be added. Recommended experimental protocols will be established, control software will be finalized, and a final, commercial product will be brought to market. The sample environment will be deployable worldwide on neutron and X-ray reflectometry beamlines. Additionally, its unique interfacial rheology capabilities will make it desirable for use in both academic and industrial laboratories. The RheoSurfRTM sample environment addresses a substantial need of the neutron scattering user community and significantly improves the nation’s scientific infrastructure through new measurement capabilities along with efficiency benefits that maximize the scientific utility of valuable beamtime.

With increased market penetration, failures from unanticipated unsteady loads, installation related reductions in power generation and significant maintenance costs have underscored the need to predict the unsteady fluid structure interactions related to turbine layout and off-design wind conditions. Contemporary turbine design tools fail to account for such loadings, and thus, the research community has started utilizing HPC Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solvers to investigate these phenomena. Unfortunately, such HPC tools are complicated to use and too expensive for routine industrial use. This problem is exacerbated further when including unsteady aeroelastic coupling between blade motion and flexibility, wake aerodynamics, and the interaction with the turbulent atmosphere. In an ongoing DOE SBIR Phase IIB an advanced forensic level HPC method for predicting wind turbine fatigue and wind farm aeromechanics is being developed. While this effort is demonstrating improved analysis capabilities and garnering interest from industry, it has also highlighted the need for an analysis method that provides easier, faster and more reliable setup to resolve the flow near to the turbine for routine design, analysis and test support. Current tools employ either low-order models that lack fidelity or body-fitted CFD grids that are time consuming and require significant expertise to create and interface with the accompanying structural model. It is generally recognized that CAD cleanup/idealization and creating body-fitted meshes are the largest impediments to practical adoption of CFD by industry and the generation of reliable results. In aeroelastic analysis, this challenge is further compounded by the task of conservatively coupling the flow solution to the structural analysis in a seamless and automated manner. It is exactly these hurdles that the proposed effort seeks to address by integrating and enhancing emerging CFD methods into a robust and easy-to-setup CFD-based aeroelastic analysis system with automated mesh generation and fluid-structure coupling procedures targeted to wind turbines and wind farms, as well as broader applicability throughout the energy, engineering and manufacturing industries. CDI recently demonstrated a high Reynolds number adaptive cut-cell Cartesian grid CFD solver generalized to accommodate imperfect surface geometries, typical of those automatically generated by CAD, and obtain high quality aerodynamics predictions autonomously. Phase I saw the development of aeroelastic analysis capabilities in this solver and proof-of-concept application to wind turbines. In this effort we plan to integrate these capabilities with the far-field flow solver being developed in ongoing ASCR work, and create a new and hardened analysis ideally suited to routine wind turbines analysis by engineers that are experts in wind energy but not CFD and CAD. A successful effort would produce a robust, validated multidisciplinary computational tool for integrated wind turbine design and analysis, along with individual solver libraries for more general application. This tool directly addresses the limitations of current CFD techniques for predicting fluid structure interaction problems such as unsteady turbine blade loading and wind farm situational interactions. Broad applicability of easy to use CFD-based analysis software to the wider energy and manufacturing industries significantly increases the commercial potential for this technology, and is evidenced by the included letter of support. Based upon a modest market entry, combined sales, and associated service work, could generate more than $33M in sales over several years, with major cost savings for customers attributed to improved predictions and lower maintenance costs.",  ,,,,Glen  Whitehouse,,(609) 538-0444,glen@continuum-dynamics.com,Georgia Institute of Technology,  ,

Modeling capability exists, but it is not cost-competitive due to the amount of computing time needed and the lack of computing facilities by the many small companies who are the innovators in this space. Thus, the industry continues to develop new large devices using the prototype and try method, which is very expensive. Tech-X will address this problem by developing a software application for high-performance, device-based computing of these devices. This software will be faster than existing solutions by an order of magnitude through both advanced computing methods and advanced algorithms, which will be employed to will minimize the time for finding optimal configurations. The application will be general, capable of simulating dispersive media, and it will be user friendly, with easy geometrical setup, and easily defined strategies for optimization, through an intuitive cross-platform Graphical User Interface. The solution will be available on the Cloud, which will make it affordable for and accessible to the many small businesses in this space. In Phase I Tech-X prototyped a new dispersive dielectric algorithm implementation making use of computed devices and optimized it. Tech-X prototyped a new algorithm for computing derivatives of figures of merit with respect to shape changes. Tech-X demonstrated how this would be set up in an intuitive graphical user interface.

Even though major discoveries have been made in the field, an upgrade at the Spallation Neutron Source will enhance future measurements by increasing the neutron flux, where advanced neutron imaging systems will need to be developed to handle the higher event rates. To handle the high event rates, RMD will develop a composite scintillator material specifically designed for thermal neutron detection using materials with inherently fast decay times. The scintillator will be optically coupled to a silicon photomultiplier, yet the signal processing will be done primarily in the digital domain, where deleterious signal effects due the high rates can be identified and systematically removed using unique signal processing methods for identifying neutrons and omitting background. The Phase I effort resulted in the fabrication of an unique organic glass scintillator loaded with boron, providing neutron sensitivity. Simulations indicate 500-um of the material will provide a 60% detection efficiency for thermal neutrons. The material has multiple decay times, each less than 100 ns, supporting high event rate (> 1 Mcps) counting for neutron imaging. We demonstrated a method to provide gamma- neutron separation using a time over threshold technique. The technique could provide neutron imaging information with gamma rejection using one logic gate, which is critical for a compact readout using a field programmable gate array (FPGA) and for achieving high-spatial resolution (1-mm). The Phase-II effort will develop the organic glass to provide the thin, high-efficiency scintillator. The front- end readout electronics will be prototyped and tested in the lab for establishing requirements on the single, time-over-threshold logic gate. A prototype circuit designed and fabricated in a CMOS process will be done to provide a high-density readout for the imager, and the FPGA coding will be developed to provide a prototype imager for testing at the Spallation Neutron Source.

The Bunch Shape Monitor (BSM) is a well-known device used for measuring the longitudinal bunch distribution in ion linacs. However, the existing BSM models have poor electron collection efficiency from the wire and are limited to one dimensional measurements of the phase coordinate. At the same time, there is a great potential of using BSMs for advanced beam dynamics experiments, but the technical limitations of the existing design make it difficult. In response to this problem, RadiaBeam has designed a BSM with improved performance that incorporates three major innovations. First, the collection efficiency was improved by adding a focusing field between the wire and the entrance slit. Second, an improvement of the measurement speed was achieved by sampling longitudinal profiles of multiple energy slices simultaneously. Finally, the design will be augmented with both a movable wire and a microwave deflecting cavity to add functionality and enable measuring the transverse profile as with a wire scanner. In Phase I, we performed full electromagnetic design and in-depth analysis of the proposed multi- dimensional bunch shape monitor, which included beam dynamics studies. In the numerical model, we achieved a significant improvement in collection efficiency and linearity of the beam. A prototype of the improved focusing system was fabricated and delivered to the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), with proof- of-principle tests planned in the near future. We also performed conceptual engineering design of the scanner, including the design of a movable wire system. In the Phase II project, we will develop the next generation bunch shape monitor prototype, taking advantage of all the aforementioned improvements, and test it at SNS. The full system will include the RF cavity, beam formation system, detectors and data acquisition system. The device will be engineered, fabricated and assembled at RadiaBeam, and then delivered to SNS where the commissioning program will include beam tests with a proton source. Success in this project will enable RadiaBeam to deliver a useful instrument for measuring the longitudinal bunch distribution at the SNS facility. The proposed instrument can be used not only in numerous scientific proton and ion accelerators across the world but also in industrial and medical accelerators for ion implantation, isotope production, ion therapy, nuclear energy and materials irradiation.",  ,,,,Sergey  Kutsaev,,(310) 822-5845,kutsaev@radiabeam.com,,  ,

Although extensive developments on quantum buffers have been reported, they all lack practicality, mainly due to their excessive optical loss that has prevented quantum applications because of the single or low-average photon nature of the transmission signals. To date, no buffer has been successfully converted from a laboratory concept to a deliverable device. We propose to realize an all-fiber optical quantum buffer that is capable of precisely delaying quantum signals in transparent optical quantum communication networks. The novel buffer achieves quantum signal storage using a 2x2 cross electro-optic switch to trap entangled photon pairs inside a low loss fiber loop and release by timed switching. This program seeks to achieve unpresented performance in switching speed and low optical loss that are useful for the entire community to advance the field of quantum communications and networking. In Phase I, we have successfully fabricated a fully functioning fiberoptic quantum buffer. The measurements verified desirable low loss ~0.5 dB, polarization independence, fast switching time ~20ns, and a high repeat rate of 1 MHz. The ultra-low optical loss of less than 0.5 dB sets a world record for fiber- coupled electro-optical switches. We have also successfully demonstrated the storage of an optical pulse for 250 ns via optical pulse buffering and trapping. This Phase I provided us an opportunity to achieve an in-depth understanding of the high-speed electro-optic physics and identified practical ways to improve the buffer performance further to reach lower loss and faster switching in Phase II, including ultra-low optical insertion loss below 0.4 dB; fast rise/fall time below 1 ns; and fast repetition rate over 10 MHz. These performance attributes have not been obtained before. Quantum communications is a revolutionary technology that could open up a universe of applications that are not possible with classical communications, including secure communications, teleportation for quantum communications when only a classical channel is available, and connecting quantum computers together. Quantum communications will alter how we do business in the future. It will fundamentally change how we secure data and security in our technology-driven world. Some see it as one day displacing the Internet in its current form.

Minirhizotron experiments enable nondestructive imaging of in situ root systems, but their analysis is complicated by a labor and expertise intensive manual image segmentation task. Images of roots must be manually traced before data can be extracted, a process that can take several months of a technician’s time and is a severe bottleneck for actionable results. This combined Phase I/II project is building a software tool to automate the analysis of minirhizotron images. Automation is achieved by using tools from computa- tional differential geometry to find representations of roots in images that can be applied in general settings. During Phase I, a prototype software pipeline was developed to validate the automated root identification procedure. Also, a prototype application was implemented to allow a user to inspect results and engage with data in a limited active learning activity, which was used to further filter out artifacts. Trait analysis data was produced on image data collected during the course of the project, and the project approach was validated by demonstrating that the resulting data was sensitive to experimental effects. During Phase II, prototype software will be refactored and packaged into a commercial software product. Several improvements to the algorithmic approach that were identified during the Phase I research will be implemented. Minirhizotron image data will be generated at higher resolutions and with plant breeds that will enable validation of the software’s application to more fine root features. Root phenotyping is of growing interest in the commercial agriculture sector. Lowering the cost to entry (in terms of capital, time, and expertise) to high-throughput minirhizotron analysis will be of immense impact in a sec- tor where the value of big data is being increasingly leveraged.

SmallSats/CubeSats are quicker/cheaper to develop than their larger predecessors. The primary bottleneck has been a lack of standards in the type of subsystems being offered in form, fit, and function. Standardization would go a long way to improve the mission success and reduce development time and cost of a CubeSat. Payload developers spend gt;50% of their time/resources on creating a satellite bus system instead of on development of the sensor/device, the data from which is the primary rationale for the mission. Attempts have been made to create standardized systems, interfaces, and even materials for SmallSats/CubeSats. However, there has not been a universal acceptance for these ldquo;yet to be finalizedrdquo; standards. The perception exists that those involved in trying to establish certain requirements are focused on specific CubeSat architectures that are in their immediate portfolio. For this proposal, Vistacent is defining ldquo;standardizationrdquo; of the modular units as the basic CubeSat structure to allow structural and electrical standard connectivity between modules. Vistacent proposes to 3D print modular ldquo;building blocksrdquo; for a complete architecture. This ldquo;standardizationrdquo; will also allow COTS components to be ldquo;plugged-inrdquo; or ldquo;hot-swappedrdquo; to the modules.

Ultra-low transverse emittance ??,? would enable brighter, higher energy x-ray free electron lasers (FEL), better colliders, and more coherent, detailed ultrafast electron diffraction/microscopy (UED/UEM), unlocking new nanoscale discoveries. Maintaining high quantum efficiency (QE) avoids laser-induced nonlinearities. State- of-the-art is 100 pC bunches from copper (??,? 0.4 ?m). Advances towards 0.1 ?m require ultra- low emittance, high QE, cryo-compatible materials. This proposal minimizes physical and chemical roughness of high QE alkali antimonides to reduce emittance. Single crystal epitaxial growth is planned through novel substrate lattice-matching and ion-beam-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (IBA-MBE). Such cathodes are anticipated to achieve excellent electron transport favorable for high QE and low emittance due to the single or large grain crystal structure with few grain boundaries and minimal crystal defects. It is anticipated that when operated cryogenically at high field, Cs3Sb intrinsic emittance can approach a record 0.1 ?m/mm (5 meV mean transverse energy). Our objective was true epitaxial growth toward large grain or single crystal alkali antimonide photocathodes. We achieved (1) epitaxial growth on a new lattice- matched substrate with stunning 0.157 nm rms physical roughness and 4% QE in Cs3Sb, (2) the first-ever chemical roughness maps of an active alkali antimonide. (3) a near-zero calculated contribution to emittance from the measured roughness, even at higher field (≥10 MV/m), and (4) a feasible Phase II design for IBA-MBE. Based on these completed tasks and our innovative solutions we now have a clear path to product development and prototyping in Phase II. In Phase II, cryogenic 20 K gun test at 10 MV/m field and high laser fluence will demonstrate ultra-low emittance of epitaxial cathodes. Single crystal IBA-MBE will measure crystallinity, stoichiometry, roughness, and band structure. A Monte Carlo model of emission will inform analysis. We will assess compatibility with superconducting RF photoinjectors, and open a production capability. Phase II will conclude with demonstrated ability to produce a new class of ultra-low emittance electron sources, well prepared to commercialize in Phase III. The potential market for high QE, low emittance photocathodes is significant.

This Light Source upgrade will provide X-ray energies up to 20 keV necessary to study fundamental atomic structure dynamics, electronic and nuclear coupling in biological and chemical processes. But to realize this upgrade there is a need to improve the reliability and the performance of the photocathode where the electrons are photoemitted in the accelerator. The currently-grown photocathodes at the Light Source are inadequate to meet the desired upgrade requirements. RMD will address the Light Source upgrade needs for the Stanford Linear Accelerator by reliable manufacturing of cathodes via sputtering technique and packaging them under vacuum for shipment to Stanford. Because the sputter-grown cathodes have a better performance and more robust compared to the conventional cathodes, they will facilitate the necessary upgrade. These cathodes will be protected by graphene top-layers that will extend the cathode lifetime in the accelerator. Also, sputtering allows mass production and thus stockpiling of cathodes, which the Linear Accelerator could purchase and introduce the same into their photo guns in a reliable fashion, when necessary. During Phase I, RMD was able to demonstrate the growth of bialkali antimonide photocathodes by sputtering technique, where multiple cathodes were demonstrated with similar performance specifications. The sputtered cathodes have exceptional surface smoothness and high-efficiency in green wavelength which will facilitate the desired beam brightness. A compatible vacuum packaging for the cathode was also independently demonstrated, which was unsealed at the Cornell beamline successfully in order to produce an electron beam. During the Phase II effort, the various unit operations demonstrated in Phase I will be integrated together to usher the manufacturing process for advanced photocathodes designed for Stanford Linear Accelerator energy upgrade.

The availability of packaged cathodes will streamline the supply for accelerators at various national labs, small industries and Universities.

Both JLAB and FNAL recently faced this challenge coating high-conductivity copper onto flexible de-coupling bellows for the SLAC LCLS-II-HE cryomodule upgrade, as well replace a bellows waveguide assembly on CEBAF.

One such ldquo;defectrdquo; is related to metal vapor condensate contamination. One of the benefits of the EBAM process is its efficient use of power as well as the high purity vacuum environment. These process characteristics allow EBAM to provide fast deposition speeds that in many cases lead the industry. One side effect of this high deposition rate with the vacuum is that the raw material is often vaporized at a high rate as well and this metal vapor condenses back into solid form on surfaces local to the process. Over time the condensate build up can become substantial and occurrences have been observed where the condensate gets dislodged and can fall into the melt pool. Sciaky has learned that in the case of EBAM deposition targeting Ti-6Al-4V, the condensate is made up of predominantly aluminum.nbsp; This issue is a well-documented concern when processing alloys with elements having various vapor pressures in a high vacuum environment.nbsp; If the condensate becomes entrapped within the molten pool, the local area no longer achieves the target chemistry or metallurgical properties.nbsp; There has been at least one instance where the condensate provided a crack initiation site that resulted catastrophic failure of a preform in response to residual stress buildup.Our phase 1 approach will target the real-time identification of metal condensate events, document the location of detected events and provide the basis for corrective action avoiding the scrapping of a part. This proof of concept shall provide the basis for a series of other identified defects to be addressed via a machine learning approach that may include material contaminants, process interruptions, gross lack of fusion type defects, large porosity and potentially others as the approaches get refined.",NASA SBIR  Support Office,,(301) 937-0888,sbir@reisystems.com,Scott  Stecker,,(708) 594-3800,sstecker@sciaky.com,,  ,

One of the major limiting factors of these furnaces is the cooling rate. Currently, the vacuum furnace relies on the radiation to dissipate heat, takes at least 5 hours to cool the furnace to room temperature resulting in significant limitation of using expensive neutron beam time. To tackle this challenge, ACT proposes an innovative active cooling system to significantly reduce the down time for neutron scattering furnaces. The system includes a closed helium (He) circulation loop, a flow distributor nozzle, an external heat exchanger, and a chiller to achieve fast and controllable cooling. Due to the much higher thermal conductivity of the He gas compared to other inert gases (e.g. nitrogen, argon), heat can be removed from the system more effectively. By introducing the He flow inside the radiation shields via a flow distributor nozzle, the cooling rate can also be controlled by adjusting the flow rate. The proposed active cooling system has no consumables (full recycling of the helium) and requires minimal human operation. In Phase I, a prototype neutron scattering vacuum furnace was fabricated with the support from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The furnace served as a platform to test the proposed He circulation cooling system. Under vacuum conditions, the system required 6.6 hours for the heating element to be cooled from 400oC to 100oC. By using a flow distributor nozzle to introduce the He flow into the radiation shield and heating element, the cooling rate can be further reduced to 11 minutes. With the capability of controlling the cooling rate, the team has demonstrated the feasibility of achieving a linear temperature drop (constant cooling rate). The controllability together with low neutron scattering and adsorption coefficients of helium provide the potential of in-situ cooling for advanced material experiments. This will allow experimenters to perform controlled transient thermal tests that could not have been done before. In Phase II, ACT will continue working with ORNL to optimize the system performance. A control method will be developed to achieve precise controlled cooling rate. The cooling system will be integrated into one neutron furnace at ORNL to demonstrate the cooling performance under actual neutron experiment. In addition to the neutron furnace, the proposed cooling technology is able to be applied to most heat treatment furnaces that can be benefited from fast and controlled cooling.",  ,,,,Chien-Hua  Chen,,(717) 205-0613,chien-hua.chen@1-act.com,,  ,

Surface and volume defect formation and migration in conjunc- tion with carrier transport processes have a profound impact on the opto-electro-thermo-mechanical prop- erties of materials. Understanding these phenomena requires a unique combination of advanced atomic- scale imaging with controlled nanoscale excitation and quantitative probing of fundamental processes. The proposed innovation is focused on a method for simultaneous nanoscale multimodal imaging of en- ergy conversion/transfer processes by integrating tip-based pulsed laser radiation sources within a trans- mission electron microscope (TEM). Nanoscale confinement of radiation fields of enhanced intensity un- derneath a tip-based probe enables unambiguous and direct in-situ interrogation of the nanostructural ef- fects on the material properties. In this project, an apparatus combining nanoscale laser excitation and optical signal collection of photoluminescence (PL), time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), ultrafast optical probing and Raman spectra will be designed, tested and integrated into a TEM holder. In Phase I, tapered fiber and near field probe tips have been employed for excitation of the optical response of the specimen with nanoscale spatial resolution. Custom miniature optics for efficient signal collection and a benchtop prototype apparatus has been designed and constructed, which enabled far-field and near-field PL spectroscopy while meeting the requirements for implementation into the TEM instrumentation.Based on this work, Phase II project is proposed to construct and test an integrated TEM holder for in-situ multimodal optical spectroscopy and validate its performance via detailed ex-situ TEM experiments and analytical diagnostics. Furthermore, the prototype will be tested in the real scientific studies, for example, in-situ characterization of defects in the synthesis of nanostructures. The outcome of this project will enable a widespread adoption of unique facility for the in situ direct cor- relation of optical spectroscopy with atomic level imaging. This entirely new capability will undoubtedly have a profound impact to the fields of Materials Science and Manufacturing. The users of the proposed approach can embark on a host of fundamental studies on the true nanoscale interaction of photons with materials that are impossible to conduct by the presently available instrumentation.

Direct solar-to-hydrogen generation would enable the conversion of renewable energy and water into a storable fuel, thereby drastically reducing carbon emissions. However, solar-driven water splitting devices are hindered by lack of optimized materials, especially membranes, for the unique challenges associated with solar fuel formation. To improve utilization of solar energy and reduce fossil fuel consumption, Giner is proposing a device to convert solar energy and water directly into storable hydrogen fuel. It will integrate novel anion exchange membrane technology originally developed by Dr. Yushan Yan and subsequently commercialized at W7energy, electrocatalysts and photoelectrodes developed by Dr. James McKone, and Giner’s established water electrolysis platform. This solar-powered water-splitting device will directly generate hydrogen and oxygen from water, using only sunlight as an energy source. Anion exchange membranes developed at W7energy were tested for stability under simulated solar light. In inert atmosphere, these membranes demonstrated <1% loss of ion exchange capacity (IEC) and no loss of functional group cations in strong base for over 140h under sunlight. In open air they demonstrated <2% IEC loss and no cation loss for over 70 h, but suffered some mechanical degradation, suggesting some oxidative stress to the membrane backbone under sunlight. These membranes were also used in traditional electrolyzers and displayed stable performance for over 500 h operating at 0.5 A/cm2 in pure water. Hyperbranched polymer membranes were also developed that show promising initial results, forming transparent, flexible membranes that were stable under the simulated solar light in air, with IECs comparable to the W7energy baseline membranes. We plan to develop an anion exchange membrane that is stablefor over1000hundersunlight.We will develop electrocatalysts that show hydrogen production rates exceeding 100 mA/mg at 300 mV total overpotential in alkaline or neutral conditions. These materials will integrate into a direct solar-to-hydrogen conversion device based on Giner’s established 100 cm2 electrolysis platform, which will demonstrate solar-to-hydrogen efficiency exceeding 10%. Hydrogen obtained directly through solar-driven water splitting would provide a storable, scalable fuel source without greenhouse gas emissions with no need for external power sources (other than solar) or electrical conversion systems. The commercial development of a direct solar-to-hydrogen device, as proposed herein, would enable hydrogen production for fuel in remote areas without reliable electricity, transportation infrastructure, or after a natural disaster event, because it requires only sunlight and water to operate.",  ,,,,Judith  Lattimer,,(781) 529-0530,jlattimer@ginerinc.com,,  ,

Early recognition of clinical deterioration and rapid initial management is paramount in any setting where emergency care is provided. In military medicine and humanitarian care, delivering high quality and timely care to injured patients poses even greater and more complex challenges compared to civilian practice. Training and ongoing assessment pose substantial challenges for providing effective emergency medical care in military environments. Current best practice in medical training focuses on competency attainment, as opposed to mere knowledge or skill acquisition. Recurrent training (e.g. refresher courses) has been shown to be essential to maintain clinical competency. To optimize performance during emergency care in theater, novel refresher and/or “just-in-time” educational solutions are needed to enable “in-mission” emergency care training and assessment of service members in austere environments. In order for refresher training to be both efficient and effective, assessment of learners must play a significant role in the development and deployment of these educational strategies. The use of virtual reality (VR) for emergency care training has shown great promise. Recent research has shown that VR-based simulations are as efficient as training programs conducted in traditional simulation centers. The long-term goal of this project is to develop and validate a realistic mobile-based VR platform (CORE-Military) for frontline service members in austere environments, enabling effective just-in-time emergency care training and personalized assessment through AI-enabled learning analytics.

This work will address the demonstration of large-scale utilization of captured waste CO2 by converting it into ethylene glycol, a monomer used in the production polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic. In the first demonstration, we will target utilizing waste CO2 from the chemical industry producing conventional plastics from fossil resources. Secondary markets include waste CO2 from power production, in this application including carbon utilization with existing carbon capture offsetting up to 150% of the CO2 capture costs, ensuring that the reduction in emissions in clean coal plants is economically feasible. RenewCO2 has demonstrated the small-scale prototype of ethylene glycol synthesis from concentrated waste CO2, water, and renewable electricity. In Phase I, we focused the lab-scale demonstration on 1) increasing the product formation, 2) developing a low capital cost electrolyzer, and 3) techno-economic analysis. In this Phase II, RenewCO2 will address the process's scale-up to a pilot plant and demonstrate long-term durability. An electrochemical stack will be developed and integrated into a pilot-scale process unit producing >100 kg of ethylene glycol product, which will be deployed and tested at a strategic partner site. Phase II of this research project builds on Phase I to accelerate the scale-up of the CO2 upcycling process developed by RenewCO2 together with Rutgers University. Phase I showed great promise for producing electrochemical cells from low-cost materials such as plastic and demonstrated a new reactor. In Phase II, the team will further increase the productivity of the process (reaction rate) by overcoming mass transport limitations of current systems and tuning catalyst formulation to achieve production rates of >1 g/h. Secondly, durability studies will be conducted to ensure long-term system performance. Through these optimizations and by utilizing new 2nd generation fiber-reinforced polymers with greatly enhanced physical, the team will tackle high capital costs that present a barrier for entry for companies considering this technology. For the large-scale components needed for electrolyzers and with the low-cost synthesis method developed at Rutgers, we expect to leverage the low cost with no loss in performance in the final cells. In this Phase, we will investigate additional capital cost reductions possible from manufacturing methods. Together these advances will be the most crucial step for achieving a cost- competitive process for commercialization. The global ethylene glycol market is projected to grow at more than 4-6% per year; however, fluctuating raw material costs are limiting market expansion. The market currently undergoes boom/bust cycles as capacity is most often increased too rapidly, resulting in excess offer and reducing sales prices. Providing the industry with a method for modular expansion of the capacity at no increased CapEx will lessen the financial risk in the sector tremendously. This technology also utilizes CO2 conversion, offering a new and efficient route to produce ethylene glycol from renewable sources while using waste carbon dioxide from the conventional fossil fuel-powered process. One of the advantages of electrochemical conversion technologies is that it allows for versatile feedstocks. As the demand for ethylene glycol increases, additional capacity is needed, and on-site power generation plants will be outfitted with CC combined with our demonstrated carbon utilization technologies. Electrosynthesis from carbon dioxide to ethylene glycol has generally been energy inefficient, causing high production costs and preventing commercialization until development of the present technology. This technology will provide new opportunities for efficient chemical production and feedstock diversification while at the same time reducing carbon dioxide emissions.",  ,,,,Anders  Laursen,,(917) 200-8343,anders.laursen@renewco2.com,,  ,

In carbon storage operations, reliable characterization of the in-situ stress state in the complex storage reservoirs and the cap rock formations is critical for safe storage of CO2 and minimizing potential environmental hazards related to fluid leakage and induced seismicity. Also, the integrity of the borehole is directly dependent on the stresses profile along the well trajectory and appropriate design of the drilling and stimulation operations. In-situ stresses are notoriously difficult to determine. Several methodologies have been used to date to estimate in-situ stresses. Seismic-based methods offer the advantage of covering a larger volume of subsurface formations, but do not provide sufficient vertical resolution for the required subsurface characterization, especially for carbon storage purposes. Log-based methods that are commonly used for stress estimation rely on the use of costly well logs such as image, density, porosity, sonic etc., together with oversimplified models or correlations to estimate stresses. Another drawback is the typical absence of the required logs (e.g., dipole sonic) and the lack of them outside the pay zones. Logs are also rarely available in unconventional horizontal wells, where the lateral changes in the state of stress is crucial to optimize the stimulation design. These limitations and shortcomings identify an essential requirement for new methodologies and sources of data for stress evaluations, which provide full coverage of the well length at a higher resolution. This project investigates the use of downhole drilling dynamic data together with advanced signal processing, data analytics and machine learning techniques to calculate subsurface in-situ stresses along vertical, deviated, or horizontal wells in real-time. The promising results of the Phase I study successfully proved the concept behind the proposed technology. We found the frequency band of the signals carry information about the stress field and used it to generate reasonably accurate 1-D profiles of the principal in-situ stresses. Building on our findings in Phase I, our main objectives for the Phase II are: (i) validating the findings over a wider range of data acquired in different rock types, bit types and well trajectories, (ii) exploring alternative signal processing approaches, (iii) extending the model to estimate rock mechanical properties as well, (iv) upgrading the machine learning regressor model to deep neural network, and (v) developing and commercializing a software platform hosting this technology.",  ,,,,Hamed  Soroush,,(404) 916-9446,hmdsoroush173@gmail.com,,  ,

Domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing is struggling to meet demands. It is therefore
imperative to develop tools to rapidly increase the productivity of existing production plants.
Manufacturing of pharmaceuticals currently relies almost entirely on batch-based chemical
synthesis. In this approach, chemical synthesis takes place in several separate steps within
large reactors. Synthesis in continuous flow (with chemicals flowing continuously during the
reaction process) is emerging as a more efficient alternative. However, synthesis in continuous
flow is not being widely adopted due to several practical reasons, including the need for major
investments to overhaul existing production plants.
Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) represents the most frequent post-reaction step in pharmaceutical
syntheses. Importantly, while technologies currently used for LLE in the context of batch
synthesis are a bottleneck that dramatically reduces process efficiency, LLE extraction in
continuous flow is highly efficient. Existing technologies for LLE in flow cannot currently be used
in batch-based manufacturing plants because their maximum flow rate is too low to meet the
demands of batch-based production plants.
Here, we propose to develop a novel, high capacity system to implement LLE in continuous flow
in the context of batch-based pharmaceutical synthesis. We envision a plug and play, portable,
high flow rate, self-tuning device deployable in existing pharmaceutical production plants without
the need to overhaul production processes. To build this system, in the Phase I of this SBIR, we
will address the key technological innovations needed to build a self-standing, high capacity
continuous LLE system compatible with large-scale batch-based pharmaceutical production.
Namely, we will: 1) develop a continuous flow liquid-liquid extraction system able to handle high
(turbulent) flow rates and 2) we will develop a self-tunable pressure control system able to
support the operation of such a device with minimal external control. In the Phase II of this
SBIR, we will take advantage of these technological innovations to create a user-friendly
product ready for deployment within existing pharmaceutical production plants.
If successful, this project will produce a tool able to immediately increase the productivity of
existing pharmaceutical plants from 2 to 5-fold. This product will redefine the landscape of
pharmaceutical production in the United States and beyond.Project Narrative

In doing so, the project aims to accelerate the decarbonization of two of the largest sources of CO2 emissions: the energy and transportation sectors. To date, cost reductions in LIBs have been mostly driven by economies-of-scale, but these reductions are now reaching a plateau. To further drive down costs, this SBIR project will demonstrate a coating innovation that improves battery capacity and lifetime while eliminating certain costly and time-consuming bottlenecks that exist in current LIB manufacturing. The combined result of these enhancements will be a LIB with greatly reduced cost per kWh relative to the state of the art, ultimately enabling cost-competitive electric vehicles as well as widespread renewable energy storage. This SBIR Phase II project will focus on the application of protective thin-film coatings on LIB electrodes using a low-cost, easily integrated process. These coatings protect LIBs against degradation during charge and discharge, which extends battery lifetime, improves energy density, and enables next-generation electrode materials with greater capacity. This project will scale the company's coating technology as demonstrated during Phase I from lab-scale coating tools to a pilot “roll-to-roll” (R2R) coater that matches real-world LIB factory throughput, thereby de-risking integration of the coating process into standard LIB manufacturing lines. Phase II tasks will include optimization of process parameters to meet throughput targets, equipment design to ensure coating uniformity, and continued development of thin-film deposition chemistry to maximize cell performance improvements. By its conclusion, the Phase II project will demonstrate prototype LIBs with an anticipated >20% enhanced energy density as well as 30% reduced cost/kWh relative to the state of the art.

The prevalence of vaping nicotine has skyrocketed among adolescents in recent years, yet no NIH-funded trials
have developed or evaluated vaping cessation interventions. An ideal treatment must directly target established
vaping risk factors. Depressive symptoms, which are common among adolescent vapers (36%), have recently
been identified as a predominant vaping-related risk factor. The relationship between depressive symptoms and
vaping is bidirectional such that depressive symptoms prospectively predict vaping initiation and sustained e-
cigarette use exacerbates depression. Among smokers with depressive symptoms, tailored interventions that
target both depression and tobacco use are necessary for cessation. Thus, an ideal treatment for adolescent
vapers with depressive symptoms likely must also directly target depressed mood. Brief Behavioral Activation
(BA) is a well-established, evidence-based treatment for depression and smoking cessation. An adapted version
of Brief BA for adolescent vaping cessation could offer a promising approach to simultaneously target depressive
symptoms in the service of promoting vaping cessation. To have maximum population-level impact, this
intervention must be delivered via real-world clinical outlets and disseminable platforms. Primary care providers
are on the front lines of adolescent vaping treatment but have limited treatment resources. Tailoring Brief BA for
adolescent vaping cessation and delivery via a mobile app could offer an ideal strategy to disseminate evidence-
based, depression-specific vaping cessation treatment via primary care. The goal of this high risk-high reward
study is to develop, refine, and evaluate a depression-specific Brief BA for adolescent vaping cessation mobile
app (“Goal2QuitVaping”). Via an established partnership between MountainPass Technology LLC and the
Medical University of South Carolina, we will develop Goal2QuitVaping consistent with feedback gathered during
focus groups with end-users. Software development will build upon our prior and ongoing research developing
app adaptations of Brief BA for primary care depression and smoking cessation treatment. Goal2QuitVaping will
subsequently be improved via iterative usability testing. We will then conduct a two-group feasibility randomized
controlled trial of 1) Goal2QuitVaping vs. 2) treatment as usual for vaping cessation within primary care. Go/no
go decision benchmarks for Phase II include: 1) development of Goal2QuitVaping, 2) demonstrated
Goal2QuitVaping treatment feasibility and acceptability, defined as ³70% app retention across follow-up and
end-user self-reported benefit of Goal2QuitVaping use, and 3) efficacy data suggesting that Goal2QuitVaping
use is associated with decreases in depressive symptoms and nicotine vaping. Research activities are coupled
with strong commercialization opportunities which together will propel our company toward Phase II and beyond
to address the public health need for evidence-based vaping cessation interventions for adolescents.PROJECT NARRATIVE
The prevalence of vaping nicotine (i.e., e-cigarette use) has skyrocketed among adolescents in recent years,
effectively reversing five decades of decreasing nicotine use among youth and leading the Surgeon General to
declare adolescent e-cigarette use an epidemic. Despite a large commercial market and clear public health need,
no NIH-funded trials have developed or evaluated the efficacy of interventions for adolescent vaping cessation.
Directly aligned with the NIDA STTR program, the goal of this high risk-high reward Stage 1 treatment study is
to develop, systematically refine, and preliminarily evaluate a depression-specific Brief Behavioral Activation for
adolescent vaping cessation mobile app (“Goal2QuitVaping”).",  ,,,,JENNIFER R DAHNE,,(443) 625-8435,dahne@musc.edu,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,  ,

Problem to be Solved and Significance: Exposure to Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is a risk factor for the
development of skin cancer, and health care agencies recommend that sunscreens be used as a preventative
measure. Recent legislation in the U.S. and internationally has banned the sale of ingredients that are
fundamental to water-resistant sunscreens, creating an urgent need for new products that satisfy existing and
emerging legislation.
Product and Long-Term Goal: The product of this SBIR will be a wholly biocompatible SPF 30 broad spectrum
sunscreen cream, sold in 6-oz tubes, that satisfies FDA’s criteria to be labeled as ‘Water Resistant (80 min)’ and
is based on the Nanometics (d.b.a. PHD Biosciences [PHD]) proprietary elastomer technology. Successful
development of this sunscreen product directly addresses the mission of the National Cancer Institute by
improving protection against UVR and decreasing the risk of skin cancer.
Technological Innovation: The PHD sunscreen incorporates PHD’s proprietary biodegradable elastomer
technology, which is the first plant derived elastomer for topical products that provides water resistance, is
compatible with all Food and Drug Administration approved UV filters, and recapitulates the favorable aesthetic
properties of silicone elastomers.
Specific Aim #1. To demonstrate that the PHD Sunscreen is water resistant for at least 80 min on healthy
volunteers. Studies in this Aim will be conducted under FDA guidance and will demonstrate the feasibility that
the PHD sunscreen is resistant to removal with water after 80 min of continuous immersion in water. Success
Criterion: This Aim will be successful if after 80 min of water immersion, the mean SPF falls within one standard
deviation of the pre-immersion SPF of 30.
Commercial Opportunity: The global sunscreen market is projected to exceed $2.5 billion by 2023. Primary
and secondary market research supports the need for the PHD Sunscreen to meet the emerging needs created
by new legislation. Phase II SBIR studies will include additional studies to confirm safety on a larger number of
volunteers; compare performance to leading commercial sunscreens; and optimize the chemistry,
manufacturing, and control (CMC) processes to produce the product at commercial scale.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is a known risk factor for the development of skin cancer, which is the
most common form of cancer in the United States. Water resistant sunscreens are available but do not satisfy
emerging global environmental regulations. This Phase I SBIR proposal seeks to further the development of a
long-wear SPF 30 sunscreen with high affinity and improved retention on human skin. The novel sunscreen
provides extended protection from UV-mediated toxicities and its continued development remains a significant
priority.",  ,,,,STEVEN  ISAACMAN,,(646) 801-3872,steve@phdbiosciences.com,,  ,

There are over 272 million passenger cars registered in the United States and over one billion worldwide. As the transition to electric vehicles takes hold, potential markets for ultra-fast battery chargers for these electric vehicles will be sizeable. Estimates for the commercial market for electric vehicle charging stations is projected to reach $27.7 billion by 2027 from an estimated $2.5 billion in 2019. This project addresses the persistent problem of long electric vehicle recharging times and associated “range anxiety” among consumers. More specifically, an ultra-fast electric vehicle recharging system will be applied to emerging fast-charge batteries so that delays in re-energizing electric vehicles will be no more time-consuming than similar delays for refueling gasoline-powered vehicles. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the basic feasibility of an ultra-fast battery-charging system for consumer applications that can fully re-energize a typical light-duty electric vehicle in as little as six minutes. The project will focus on development of safe power conversion and transmission equipment that will be applied to power-matched fast-charge batteries currently emerging in commercial markets. Because the power levels required for ultra-fast EV charging are necessarily high, the project will focus on innovative measures to ensure public safety and system reliability while obtaining high electrical efficiencies. A relatively low power model will be constructed in Phase I for later scale-up. Solving technical challenges associated with an ultra-fast high-power electric vehicle charger has potential to advance knowledge of electromagnetics, power electronics, automated control, and materials science associated with ultra-fast electric vehicle recharging. The project will lead to new findings that will help solve the persistent problem of long delays in recharging electric vehicle batteries.

Sarya LLC (Sarya) is a nuclear medicine technology company formed to commercialize radiopharmaceuticals.
The goal of this Fast-Track STTR is to develop a new specific imaging agent for diagnosis, staging, and
treatment of the hematological cancer, multiple myeloma (MM). MM is the 2nd most common blood cancer
with an estimated 32,000 new cases and 13,000 deaths per year. Accurate detection is critical for enhancing
survival in MM patients. Traditional skeletal survey and bone scans have sensitivity limitations for osteolytic
lesions manifested in MM. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) performed with a PET radiopharmaceutical
(imaging agent) is a sensitive, quantitative and non-invasive clinical imaging technology to accurately detect,
localize and phenotype MM cells throughout the body. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the only FDA-
approved PET imaging agent for MM. Unfortunately, MM cells express low levels of GLUT-1 transporter and
hexokinase, which are required for FDG uptake and retention. Additionally, MM bone marrow harbors FDG-
avid inflammatory cells. There is an unmet need for molecularly targeted, sensitive and specific MM imaging
agents that can accurately stage and restage MM, identify high-risk MM patients, guide personalized MM
treatment, and evaluate clinical response to treatment. The product of this STTR will be a specific and
sensitive PET imaging agent (64Cu-LLP2A) for MM. Published data and ongoing first-in-human trial results
have significantly informed the Phase I and II aims of this proposal. The Phase I Segment consists of two
specific aims: (1) Perform dose escalation and single dose toxicity testing in mice. (2) Compile data for new
dose and submit amendment of eIND to FDA. Three milestones will be met in Phase I: (1) A new mass will be
selected based on no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL), i.e. clinical signs of organ toxicity (vehicle vs
experimental). (2) Based on the new determined mass, and in vivo preclinical image quality data, a new
specific activity (Ci/mol) will be established. (3) Obtain FDA approval of Sarya sponsored amended eIND
application. The Phase II segment involves a clinical trial and has one specific aim: Quantify the efficacy of
64Cu-LLP2A-PET imaging for detecting active MM in humans in a prospective imaging trial. Phase II
milestones are: (1) Demonstrate high detection rates (% of scans that are positive for a focal lesion, pandlt;0.05)
for 64Cu-LLP2A versus FDG in MM patients. (2) Accuracy of 64Cu-LLP2A for active MM will be assessed
using standard-of-care bone marrow (BM) biopsies and serum biomarker M-protein levels as the standards of
reference. A correlation coefficient of 0.7 will be considered reasonably strong. In summary, Phase I will prove
feasibility that 64Cu-LLP2A is tolerable with NOAEL resulting in a new eIND. Phase II will provide 64Cu-
LLP2A-PET preliminary performance data to support a New Drug Application for 64Cu-LLP2A as a New
Molecular Entity (NME) for FDA approval of Phase 2 clinical trials.PROJECT NARRATIVE

women) and significant morbidity and mortality. There are currently no effective therapeutic agents for the
disorder. The goal of Courage Therapeutics is the development of melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) -specific
agonist peptides for the treatment of anorexia nervosa. The product of this Phase I STTR will be a patentable
MC3R agonist lead development candidate that can go into advanced animal testing and ADME/PK for
development of a therapeutic for anorexia nervosa, during a Phase II STTR. In preliminary results presented
here, we show that MC3R is expressed in nearly all AgRP neurons in the arcuate nucleus. Activation of these
MC3R-expressing neurons in the arcuate can stimulate food intake while reducing anxiety. Further, we
demonstrate that administration of a MC3R-specific peptide results in potent stimulation of food intake in mice
that is AgRP neuron dependent. Melanocortin peptide drugs appear to be safe and effective therapeutics for a
number of other indications, however no MC3R specific therapeutics have been developed. Based on these
data, we propose that MC3R-specific agonist peptides may be developed into safe and effective therapeutics for
eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa. We have identified four promising MC3R agonist starting points,
including both D-Trp8--MSH and Ac-Arg-Arg-D-Phe(4-I)-D-Tic-NH2 as exemplary parent leads that potently
stimulate food intake in sated animals. In one aim of this application, Courage Therapeutics will design
analogues based on these two MC3R-specific agonists as promising linear peptides to improve their overall
potency, efficacy, and receptor-subtype specificity. Courage will also conduct similar studies on two cyclic
melanocortin peptides lacking receptor specificity, related to Setmelanotide (Rhythm), which has been highly
successful in clinical trials for the treatment of syndromic obesity. In this case, the starting peptides are
already known to have drug-like properties, and the chemical goal will be engineer MC3R-specificity in this
chemical class of melanocortin peptides. In Aim 2, peptides with appropriate pharmacological properties (EC50
below 10nM, Emaxandgt;50%, and a 1000x MC3R/MC4R agonist specificity) will be modified to improve stability
and bioavailability. Peptides will then be tested for in vivo efficacy on feeding, weight gain, and anxiety in both
normal animals and a model of stress-induced anorexia. Peptides will also be tested for half life and
distribution in vivo in serum and brain. The product of this Phase I STTR will be patentable MC3R agonist lead
development candidates that can go into advance preclinical testing and full ADME/PK and safety for
development of a therapeutic for AN, to be completed under Phase II of this application. A clinical trial for the
successful development candidate would then test effectiveness in a placebo controlled randomized study for
female Restricting Anorexia Nervosa in post-acute hospitalization recovery. Primary trial end-points would
include time to achieve weight restoration, meal completion, improvement of self reported EDE-Q (Eating
Disorder Examination Questionnaire) and related self-reported eating attitude scores.Anorexia nervosa is a devastating neuropsychiatric disease with a high prevalence (up to 2.2% of women) and
significant morbidity and mortality. There are currently no effective therapeutic agents for the disorder. The
product of this Phase I STTR will be patentable MC3R agonist lead development candidates that can go into
advanced animal testing and ADME/PK for development of a therapeutic for anorexia nervosa.",  ,,,,TOMI K SAWYER,,(617) 216-9921,sawyerkrt@aol.com,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,  ,

and middle-income countries (LMICs) and low-resource settings in the U.S. A longer-term goal is to treat earlier
stages of cervical dysplasia and assess immunity to the causative agent, human papillomavirus (HPV). The
heavy burden of suffering and death from cervical cancer disproportionately falls on women in resource poor
settings. Overcoming barriers to treatment, i.e. lack of infrastructure, trained specialists, specialized equipment,
cold chain, and financial resources, requires a paradigm shift in the approach to treatment that can be achieved
by the innovative immunotherapeutic agent proposed here.
IFx-Hu2.1 (SN63/016,700) is a cream-based therapeutic immunomodulator that will be optimized for stability and
performance. Our IFx-Hu2 family contains a plasmid DNA (pDNA) bulk drug substance, which can be produced
for a fraction of the cost of current immunotherapies. The pDNA encodes a complex bacterial antigen, Emm55.
When expressed on the tumor cell surface, Emm55 attracts antigen presenting cells and other cells of the innate
immune response. Non-self-epitopes such as tumor and HPV antigens are then exposed in such a way as to set
up multi-antigenic cellular and humoral adaptive immune responses. Emm55-based therapies induce
personalized, multivalent, systemic, and sustained immune responses and have the potential to treat a
broad range of cancers through enhanced tumor recognition, immune activation and epitope spreading.
Intralesional injection of IFx-Hu2.0 has an established safety profile in multiple animal studies and is currently
being tested in Phase 1 human clinical trials for cutaneous melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma and cutaneous
squamous cell carcinoma. Our preliminary clinical data corroborate pre-clinical observations, showing the
activation of T- and B-cell immune responses and tumor reduction, with no short or long-term adverse effects.
We propose to optimize the IFx-Hu2.1 formulation for temperature stability using established methods and
models. In vitro evaluation, to include standard quality control methods and a human vaginal epithelium
carcinoma model, will be followed by in vivo uptake, expression, and disease progression studies in a mouse
model of cervical cancer. Room temperature storage and self-administration will circumvent onerous clinic visits,
improve prognosis and preserve fertility. IFx-Hu2.1 cream formulation will provide a non-toxic cancer
therapeutic treatment with minimal supportive care requirements, featuring unique delivery, and high
applicability/impact to underserved populations. The data obtained by completing these studies will position
Morphogenesis, Inc. to submit an Investigational New Drug application to conduct a clinical trial for women in a
local community hospital (low-resource setting) and in South Africa (LMIC). These trials will be the objective of
an SBIR Phase 2 proposal.This proposal optimizes IFx-Hu2.1, a therapeutic, cream-formulated immunomodulator, for temperature stability.
The optimized formulation will be a non-toxic, affordable, commercially viable immunotherapy that is amenable
to self-administration. These attributes are necessary to overcome barriers to treating advanced cervical
cancer in low- and middle- income countries and low-resource settings in the U.S.",  ,,,,MICHAEL J SHAMBLOTT,,(813) 875-6600,mshamblott@morphogenesis-inc.com,,  ,

While the domestic production of natural gas is a central pillar in the transition to a cleaner energy economy, a detrimental by-product is contaminated wastewater, known as produced water, which comes to the surface in large volumes mixed with the gas. In regions such as the Marcellus Basin, the largest natural gas reserve in the United States, the only viable option is to truck this water long distances to disposal wells, where it is re-injected, for a cost that comprises large portions of the operational budget. By developing a new technology for the treatment and re-use of this water at the well-site, this project aims to provide a low-cost, environmentally sustainable solution. Doing so would reduce water management costs as much as 50%, lowering gas production costs, and conserving billions gallons of water through re-use that would otherwise be lost. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project aims to develop a new type of filtration membrane technology capable of removing critical contaminants from produced water, while providing the required durability, minimal footprint, mobility, and feasible cost to enable commercial water recycling for natural gas producers. Currently, no suitable technical solution exists for the economical recycling of produced water. This project focuses on a new type of ultra-durable silicon membrane that combines the filtration ability and low-cost of polymeric membranes with the resilience of ceramic. Through the strategic manipulation of the membrane fabrication approach, including catalyst deposition and chemical etching process parameters, efforts will focus on reducing pore size and increasing pore density in the membrane. The primary objective of the work is to enable the removal of critical contaminants from produced water, and to maximize filtration throughput in order to ensure a small footprint. Successful completion of the project will result in the advancement of the technology to the field-testing stage.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common (prevalence 30–70%) and potentially dose-
limiting side effect of many cancer chemotherapy drug treatment regimens. Clinically, CIPN presents with pain
that is burning, shooting or electric-shock-like. The increase in prevalence of cancer coupled with an increase in
the cancer survival rates due to chemotherapy regimens is transforming cancer pain into a large, unmet medical
problem. Neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., antimicrotubule agents like paclitaxel) may cause structural
damage to peripheral nerves (small fibers), resulting in aberrant somatosensory processing in the peripheral
and/or central nervous system. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons as well as neuronal cells in the spinal
cord are the preferential sites in which chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity occurs. Pathogenesis is complex but
includes alterations in ion channels. For example, the taxane paclitaxel (Taxol®) increases N-type (CaV2.2)
voltage-gated Ca2+ currents in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons; these neurons are responsible for
conveying noxious sensory stimuli, suggesting these channels are important mediators of specific sensory
abnormalities associated with CIPN. CaV2.2 channels are critical determinants of increased neuronal excitability
and neurotransmission accompanying persistent neuropathic pain. Though CaV2.2 has been targeted clinically
with Prialt® and Gabapentin, both drugs are encumbered with serious side effects. This proposal aims to develop
potent, orally available, and selective CaV2.2 channel antagonists, building on the seminal discovery of a
quinazoline CaV2.2 antagonist (IPPQ) developed in the laboratory of Dr. Rajesh Khanna (University of Arizona
(UA)), as potential candidates for the management of CIPN. IPPQ represents a new class of compounds
targeting CaV2.2 via a completely unique mechanism – that of targeting the CaVα-CaVβ interface. For this work,
we have partnered with Regulonix, LLC for characterizing select CaV2.2-targeted compounds and their analogs
in in vitro and in vivo efficacy assays as well as early ADME profiling. The work proposed here is the first step in
developing non-opioid pain treatments for CIPN. We anticipate success against paclitaxel-induced chronic pain
to translate into other chronic pain types as well, but CIPN provides focus for early stage proof-of-concept.
Regulonix’s specific aims are: (1) Design (Dr. Marcel Patek, Medicinal chemistry consultant, former Vice
President of Chemistry at Icagen, Inc.) and synthesis (Dr. Wei Wang, Director of the Drug Discovery Center, UA
or CROs) and optimization of drug-like lead series (IPPQ) and elucidation of channel specificity and biophysical
properties of select IPPQ analogs to gain mechanistic and safety information and to document the unique
pathway for function in relevant neuronal cells; (2) Profile IPPQ analogs for their in vitro cellular cytotoxicity,
physico-chemical, early ADME, and for off-target effects on GPCRs, kinases, ion channels and alternative known
pain targets; (3) Characterize the best three IPPQ analogs from Aim 2 for preclinical studies using a phenotypic
screen for motor impairment (rotarod assay) and then test the two best IPPQ analogs in an acute pain model
(paw incision) and an aggressive clinically-relevant neuropathic pain model (paclitaxel) to provide information
about oral efficacy; behavioral studies will be registered at a preclinical trials website prior to the start. An operant
method of pain testing with rodents that complements reflexive methods by addressing cognitive and
motivational processing will also be used. At the conclusion of our study, we expect to have a validated IPPQ
analog and several worthy backup compounds.NARRATIVE
Regulonix LLC proposes to develop novel small molecules to target a high-affinity protein-protein interaction
between CaVα and CaVβ subunits of the CaV2.2 voltage-gated calcium channel, a key channel in pathogenesis
of neuropathic pain including chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). The orally available CaVα-
β interaction antagonists will be tested in a neurotoxicity model (rotarod) and cellular pharmacological assays
that provide information about efficacy and function. Next, channel specificity and biophysical properties of the
best CaV2.2 antagonists will be elucidated to gain mechanistic and safety information and to document the

Project Title: Engineered TCR-T Cell Therapy Targeting Driver Mutations in NSCLC
Organization: GigaMune Inc.
PI: Matthew J Spindler, Ph.D.
Adoptive cell therapies (ACTs) including CAR-T, TCR-T, and TIL therapies have shown strong clinical
responses for the treatment of cancer patients for hematological cancers and solid tumors. However, only anti-
CD19 CAR-T cell therapies have been FDA approved and commercialized for the treatment of hematological
cancers. Numerous TCR-T cell clinical trials are ongoing for the treatment of solid tumors, but these trials
target only a handful of well-known cancer-testis and over expressed tumor antigens. Thus, there is a need to
develop TCR-T cell therapies that target novel tumor antigens.
Recurrent cancer driver mutations and fusion events in genes like KRAS, EGFR, and ALK drive tumorigenesis
in numerous cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Importantly, these mutations are
homogenously present within the tumor and the generated neoantigens have shown immunogenicity in cancer
patients and healthy individuals across common HLA types. This suggests that TCR-T cell therapies targeting
driver mutations would be a safe and effective treatment for NSCLC.
The Specific Aim of this Phase I SBIR project is to develop a catalog of natural human TCRs that target
recurrent cancer driver gene mutations present in NSCLC patients for use in TCR-engineered autologous or
allogeneic ACTs (TCR-T cells). GigaMuneandapos;s unique technology uses microfluidics, genomics, and mammalian
display to generate millions-diverse, natively paired TCRab repertoire libraries. The TCRab libraries are
immortal, enabling repeated experimentation with a panel of antigens. This will expedite discovery of rare anti-
driver mutation TCRs.
The project is led by Dr. Matthew J. Spindler, an expert in immunogenomics and inventor of the GigaMune
technology and supported by leading NSCLC oncologists Justin Gainor and Alice Shaw (Mass General). After
completing this Phase I SBIR project, GigaMune will further develop promising TCRs as TCR-T cell therapies,
through in vivo efficacy studies, in vitro safety studies, and manufacturing development.PROJECT NARRATIVE

Cancer remains an intractable disease, but doctors have been achieving incredible results with new therapies
that rely on genetic engineering of T cells. We are using microfluidics and DNA sequencing to capture disease-
modulating T cells from patients. Antitumor genes from these T cells are then engineered into healthy T cells to
create a TCR-engineered T cell therapy.",  ,,,,MATTHEW J SPINDLER,,(650) 252-2908,mspindler@gigamune.com,,  ,

Synbal and the La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI) are combining efforts to create
breakthrough new tools for COVID-19 research to enhance research and drug development
for COVID-19 disease. We aim to create a state-of-the-art set of humanized mouse strains
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, via the precision knock-in of a human mini gene at the mouse locus
in each of three loci. The clinical features of COVID-19 are poorly mimicked by the existing single
transgenic mouse models; those strains get a milder disease. In this SBIR Fast track PHASE I/II
grant, the team will humanize the ACE2 viral receptor, its co-infection protein TMRPSS2, and the
main antibody clearance receptor FCGRT to create double and triple humanized strains in
C57BL/6J and BALB/c backgrounds. These two backgrounds are Th1 responders and Th2
responders, respectively, and will allow modeling of the extreme variability of human pathology
observed in infected patients. The multiply humanized mice strains will be superior to the single-
gene transgenic models available to date; and, thus, will allow for better basic research and drug
development. To validate the strains, we plan to thoroughly characterize the effects of SAR-CoV-
2 infection at the clinical, virologic, histopathologic, and immunologic levels, and publish the
findings. The product strains created in this project, the triple humanized C57B6L/6J-
ACE2/TMPRSS2/FCGRT mice and the double humanized BALB/c-hACE2/hTMPRSS2 and
C57BL/6J-ACE2/TMPRSS2 mice will be made readily available for the academic and
pharmaceutical research communities through our animal vendor partner Jackson Labs or
Taconic Biosciences.Narrative
This proposal describes the development of breakthrough new tools for COVID-19 research to
enhance research and drug development for COVID-19 disease. We aim to create a variety of
humanized mouse strains, including doubly humanized ACE2/TMPRSS2 and triply humanized
ACE2/TMPRSS2/FCGRT on both C57BL/6J and BALB/c genetic backgrounds. To develop the
most relevant mouse models of COVID-19, we will infect these various mouse strains and

Accurate soil information is a fundamental driver of better, more efficient crop/soil management. The new technology would significantly increase farm profitability, lower food costs, and improve environmental protection and sustainability. Making higher quality soil fertility mapping readily available and usable is the goal of this project. This technology is expected to result in increased crop yield while allowing for decreased input costs, leading to higher profits in an industry that chronically suffers from low profit margins. The expected benefits include more environmentally responsible farm management and better manure-management planning, nutrient-management planning, precision farming, land use planning, planting decisions, evaluating stressors on plants, field conditioning, crop rotation, and prediction/interpretation of yields. These will result in increased farm profitability, more efficient application of nitrogen fertilizers, and increased soil health and fertility for plants. This project advances an innovative technology has three key components to produce maps of essential soil nutrients in training fields and beyond — maps that currently require extensive sampling while producing inadequate data. The first is a digital hill-slope position to select optimal sampling locations to represent the soil variability across the landscape, eliminating the need to take unnecessary soil samples. The second element leverages advanced machine-learning algorithms insensitive to the quantity of sample size. The third element is its ability to select suitable remotely sensed information (terrain derivatives and satellite imagery). The technology will select appropriate analysis scales of terrain derivatives to capture all potential soil variability. It will then select and use proper bands of satellite imagery, based on spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution, to decrease the risks of overfitting and computation time. Unlike currently available methods, this technology can predict the soil nutrients inside the training fields and beyond — i.e., this technology has the potential to predict soil properties in neighboring fields — using the soil information obtained from training fields—without the need for additional samples.

Carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas linked to climate change and environmental concerns. Solutions to sequester carbon dioxide underground and in deep oceans are expensive, and the long-term effectiveness, safety, and associated environmental impacts are unclear. This project allows highly efficient conversion of carbon dioxide into valuable green products using only renewable solar energy. The cost-effective, sustainable production of green fuels utilizing carbon dioxide as a feedstock will be key to reducing emissions and lowering dependency on fossil-based sources. Low-cost green fuels, such as methane, are expected to accelerate the penetration of a $30 billion market for the transportation and power generation sectors. This project addresses the fact that the high stability of carbon dioxide and conventional approaches to convert these molecules involve high temperature, high pressure, and/or extremely reactive reagents, rendering them expensive and harmful to the environment. Artificial photosynthesis is a promising approach to convert carbon dioxide and water into commercially valuable chemical products, such as methane, methanol, formic acid and syngas, using only solar energy. This project will assess the technical feasibility of a revolutionary artificial photosynthesis system based on photocatalyst wafers prepared using magnetron sputter epitaxy (MSE) to generate green methane from carbon dioxide in a single step. The proposed project utilizes low-cost, scalable processes to prepare photocatalyst wafers with high efficiencies and stabilities that can be extrapolated to 20+ years of operation lifetime. The key challenge is to effectively combine the novel carbon dioxide reduction functionality with the unique light harvesting and water oxidation platform, and optimize the operating parameters to enhance the overall system efficiency and robustness. The goal is to demonstrate photocatalyst wafers with 10+% solar to fuel efficiencies, unprecedented long-term stability in the carbon dioxide reduction process, and a bench-scale prototype for performance validation.

Such a tool will benefit any application in which information is gathered from multiple modes to understand the sample behavior, such as in the life sciences. Currently, this is accomplished only with two separate instruments often in different laboratories with great care needed to track the region of information between instruments. The microscopy market is an estimated $9.4 billion, $3.9 billion of which comprises electron microscopes and $3.0 billion for light microscopy. This project advances a simple, easy-to-use solution combining the two systems into one, offering significant leaps in productivity for microscopists and advancing discoveries in the life sciences. The intellectual merit of this project is based on a unique and simple architecture that reduces cost and complexity of the electron microscope while also allowing for coaxial imaging of the sample by the two modalities. In the life sciences, an increasingly popular method is to combine high resolution structural information (context) with super-resolution fluorescence images of key marked proteins to obtain functional understanding of the tissue. The user does not need to worry about position tracking and alignment. Furthermore, the architecture lends itself well to a new optical charge control method for mitigating charge build-up on the sample, a problem common to electron microscopy. The same optical path used for imaging allows co-illumination of the sample by the charge control beam. Ahead of submission of the proposal, the team completed detailed particles optics modeling and system design optimization. This Phase I project will complete the mechanical design of the microscope, build the prototype, and validate the particle optic modeling and resulting imaging performance using standard electron imaging metrology targets. Second, the project will then use the prototype to image a range of charging samples to test the charge compensation scheme.

Today’s commercial ice storage systems, based on Ice-on-Coil (IOC) technology, fails to capture this potential because efficiently moving thermal energy into and out of water as it freezes and melts is challenging. The proposed Icephobic Heat Exchange (IHEX) technology eliminates the adhesion of freezing water to cold surfaces, preventing ice buildup on the coil and realizing the power of water for low-cost, high efficiency, resilient building cooling. IHEX based thermal storage removes the primary barriers to product adoption: high cost and spatial constraint limitations. It helps building owners lower their cooling costs, strengthen their cooling resiliency, and reduce their carbon emissions through affordable and spatially adaptable solutions. From a broader perspective, storing energy is imperative to a sustainable electric grid. Globally, an estimated potential for up to 2.8% of worldwide GHG emissions can be offset through full scale deployment of IHEX technology in building cooling. Beyond reliable access to power from intermittent renewable sources, cost-effective thermal storage can increase cooling resiliency by meeting cooling demand when the electric grid is down. This SBIR Phase II project proposes to catalyze development of IHEX technology by demonstrating high reliability for IHEX materials and establish high energy density, efficiency, and cooling resiliency for commercial-scale IHEX systems. IOC systems use miles of tubing to generate the necessary amount of surface area for heat transfer, which is costly and energy intensive, and their modular systems require significant space. This project will demonstrate that IHEX technology meets all the existing strengths of IOC technology, such as durability, while addressing potential economic concerns. First, materials testing will be completed after a year’s worth of freeze/melt cycling on a prototype-scale system to indicate long IHEX system life. Second, the ability to use customizable storage tanks with high energy density will be demonstrated. Customizable, space-filling tanks will help IHEX technology eliminate the physical space constraints that have thwarted so many commercial projects. Third, a commercial-scale IHEX system will be used to derive a 20% energy efficiency improvement compared to IOC solutions and a low, $28/ton-hr cost. And finally, by working with our product end-users and industry, a 67% reduction in total cost of ownership compared to conventional cooling systems will be shown.

The proposed technology is the first lightweight fabric sensor to provide real-time information regarding hydration levels during exercise or training through selective determination of sodium levels, a better marker for athletic performance, safety, and injury.

This is because sweat losses vary significantly from athlete to athlete both in terms of concentration of electrolytes and total volume of sweat lost. When sweating, an individual may lose as little as ~200mg of sodium per liter or as much as ~2000 mg.

We propose to evaluate and optimize the portable, home-based product – the Computerized Olfactory Training
Program (COT) – as a disease modifying intervention for prevention of progressive cognitive decline and
progressive dementia in early Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The COT uses validated neuroprotective olfactory
stimulants to intensely engage the primary and secondary olfactory cortices, with stimulation parameters that
overcome olfactory habituation, paired with computerized olfactory cognitive training tasks that synergistically
enhance the same brain regions; with the goal of increasing structural and functional resilience to AD
progression. Phase I research and development met or exceeded stated technical milestones: COT
intervention led to increased olfactory and cognitive functions 6 and 12 months later in ApoE4 carriers with mild
cognitive impairment and early dementia. Among completers of 12-month follow-up visit, COT blunted
trajectory in shrinkage of the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus. Furthermore, the acute effects of odorant
molecules in the COT in regulating sleep disruptions and emotional reactivity adds to a potential value of COT
for treatment of behavioral dysfunctions in advanced AD. Alzheimer’s disease is a major public health crisis
both in the United States and worldwide. Hitherto, no therapeutic has demonstrated significant effectiveness in
modifying progression from early stages to advanced stages of AD. Most putative disease modifying
therapeutics targeting various steps of amyloid biosynthesis and amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation have either
failed to reverse cognitive decline or worsened cognitive decline in Phase III clinical trials. However,
neuroscience evidence that AD pathology progresses early, over several decades in the olfactory brain
regions, before emergence of progressive, irreversible cognitive decline and dementia, as well as experimental
and clinical findings that olfactory compromise accelerates the progression of AD, provide solid premise for
targeting olfactory structure and function in the modification of AD progression. The success of use of enriched
odor environment in reducing aggregation of pathological neurofilaments in animals spurred high hopes for
translation of olfactory training (OT) into treatment of AD in humans. Unfortunately, lack of innovative
approaches to sustain olfactory engagement sufficiently to influence functional and structural plasticity in
clinical populations, hindered the translation of OT into an AD intervention. We built an innovative olfactory
treatment delivery system for home use; established a proprietary regimen of safe neuroprotective plant
odorant extracts and stimulation parameters that overcome odorant habituation in the primary olfactory cortex;
and created a synchronized App to simultaneously administer olfactory cognitive training tasks that
synergistically target the same brain regions being stimulated by the odorants. This breakthrough product, the
COT showed excellent promise in reversing cognitive decline in our Phase I SBIR. Key technical objectives of
this Phase II project are to: (1) demonstrate COT efficacy for prevention of brain atrophy and cognitive decline
in a powered randomized clinical trial of early dementia; (2) validate its safety; (3) further configure the platform
for user-friendliness, portability for home use, acceptability and marketing; and (4) explore new indications for
treating behavioral disturbances in people with moderate to advanced dementia, in an effort to reduce care-
giver burden. Upon completion of Phase II, we will be poised to expand the research to Phase III efficacy
study, or an implementation study of effectiveness in the real-world setting through commercial partnerships
developed over the course of this project. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first evaluation of a
home-based, scalable, computerized, chemosensory-based brain stimulation for disease modification in AD.",  ,,,,SUMEET  SETH,,(860) 984-4769,seth.sumeet@gmail.com,,  ,

This could enable significant reduction in water use and allow the groundwater tables to recover and perform as water reservoirs during drought years. It potentially can raise farm yields, improve weed control for organic farmers, and promote better uptake of fertilizers - thereby minimizing the pollution of underground aquifers. The proposed technology also can lead to energy cost reductions and increased flexibility in scheduling power usage. At a systems level, it offers a new paradigm for a resilient and sustainable irrigation. The proposed research is focused on the development of an easy-to-use moisture plume simulation calculator that enables farmers to self-analyze how their soil type will react when installing a virtual water table irrigation system. The latter is designed to eliminate water lost by surface evaporation and deep percolation. The research approach taken is an interdisciplinary collaboration to mathematically model the physics of how liquid transports from the subsurface feed pipes through the porous soil to the roots of the plants in an efficient manner with adequate accuracy. The predictions will be compared with more comprehensive industry-standard hydrological model predictions and also with the experimentally collected moisture data from the field. The technical risks lie in determining whether the basic soil properties collected by the non-scientist farmers would be adequate as inputs to generate an accurate prediction of moisture plume profile across many soil types.

Migrating to hydrogen fuel may significantly reduce carbon emissions, particularly in the transportation sector, but several challenges remain in the economic and practical benefits compared to traditional carbon-based internal combustion engines. Conformable tanks are poised to address the concerns relative to high pressure storage of hydrogen. Providing additional sustainable fuel options will reduce carbon emissions. This objective of this SBIR Phase I project is to address two technical areas relative to the practical use of conformable tanks to store hydrogen at high pressure. First, due to the heat of compression, filling a high-pressure tank at high rates required by a maximum fill time of 3 minutes, can result in unacceptably high temperatures within the tank. For conformable tanks, this problem is confounded by the stratification of gas pockets within various parts of the tank.

Less than 15% of joint replacement surgeries performed in the United States today utilize advanced technology, despite superior clinical outcomes, presenting a significant commercial opportunity to address an unmet market need that will reach $5 billion globally by 2026. The proposed technology radically reduces the cost of an advanced surgical navigation system and improves outcomes. This Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project focuses on developing leading-edge, low-cost surgical navigation to help orthopedic surgeons achieve precise, personalized implant fit and placement for all joint replacement patients. Existing navigation and robotic systems for joint replacement have high upfront and recurring costs. They add time and complexity to the surgical procedure and require additional and larger incisions to accommodate invasive pins used to affix trackers to the patient's bones. The proposed system utilizes advanced 3D scanning to map patient anatomy and proprietary radar tracking technology to help surgeons fit and place implants ideally for each patient. This phase I project aims to achieve the following technical objectives: (1) validation of high resolution radar tracking accuracy, (2) implementation of 3D scanning to register patient imaging data to their anatomy, and (3) validation of a surgical planning system to personalize the procedure to each patient using an anatomic computational model of the joint and relevant soft tissues.

Hemorrhage and uncontrolled bleeding are a leading cause of death, and when not fatal can result in adverse
health outcomes with long term negative consequences including organ damage or failure, and coma.
Uncontrolled bleeding can arise from a variety of diseases, traumatic injuries, and health conditions, such as
atrial fibrillation, which afflicts over 2.6M people in the United States. Most atrial fibrillation patients are required
to take anticoagulants (ACAs). The standard of care (SOC) for internal hemorrhage is transcatheter embolization
to occlude the bleeding artery or vein, however, there are major drawbacks of currently available methods,
including high cost, lack of complete occlusion, reliance on patient coagulation, difficultly of proper administration,
imaging artifacts, and the chance of migration or fragmentation of the material. There is a significant unment
need for embolization materials that are compatible with ACAs, are easy to use, and are effective and safe for
use. To address this need, in this Fast-track proposal Obsidio, Inc is developing an innovative embolic
material called shear-thinning biomatieral (STB) that has the qualities required for a versatile and
effective embolic material. STB is ready to use and does not require mixing or preparation, is easy to administer
via standard microcatheters, can be delivered over a short or extended time period without fear of clogging the
catheter, does not produce an image artifact after administration, and is comprised of materials that are safe and
biocompatible. Moreover, STB is a more cost-effective option for both patients and hospitals and does not require
the same level of expertise to administer as other methods.The objective of this Fast-track proposal is to
develop a clinical-grade formulation of STB for peripheral hemorrhage control and initate a design
freeze, demonstrate safety of both the biomaterial and the device through ex vivo and in vivo studies,
and complete the testing required by the FDA including biocompatibility studies and GLP animal studies.
In Phase I of the Fast-track we propose to finalize STB formulation, validate the safety and efficacy of clinical-
grade STB, and evaluate its performance in a non-GLP rodent model. In Phase II of the Fast-track we propose
to validate STB performance in a non-GLP bleeding porcine model of hemorrhage, followed by ISO-10993
biocompatbility studies to confirm safety of the biomateirals, including an in vitro in vivo correlation studies to
determine the degradation of STB. Finally, we will conduct GLP studies in a porcine model to characterize the
performance and safety of STB. Successful completion of this work with enable Obsidio to advance to 510k
clearance for STB used in peripheral hemorrhage. Overall, development of this novel biomaterial will provide
physcians a novel embolization option with superior performance and versatility that will ultimately help to save
hundreds of thousands of lives annually.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Uncontrolled bleeding and hemorrhage is a leading cause of death in United States and can be caused by heart
conditions, traumatic injuries, and vascular malformations. Current treatments have significant drawbacks and
often lead to rebleeding, are not compatible with all patients, and are difficult and cumbersome to administer. To
address this need, Obsidio, Inc is developing an innovative shear thinning biomaterial (STB) that is versatile,
naturally occlusive, has a low risk of migration, fragmentation, or rebleeding, is compatible with imaging, and is
cost-effective and easy to administer to advance our ability to control hemorrhage in all patients alike.",  ,,,,EHSAN  JABBARZADEH,,(267) 235-5951,ehsan@obsidiomed.com,,  ,

The HOPE APP: An Immersive Telehealth Solution Adapted for Older AdultsType 2 diabetes (T2DM) is an epidemic related to obesity, chronic stress, unhealthy eating and
inactivity. An estimated 29 million people in the US have T2DM and 84 million have pre-diabetes - nearly half
of whom are adults over 65yo, putting many older adults at higher risk of unhealthy aging and cognitive
decline. A healthy lifestyle can treat and even reverse T2DM. But making lifestyle changes is hard and many
people fail, contributing to $325 billion in US healthcare costs. Diabetes group visits (DGV) and diabetes self-
management education and support (DSME/S) help people with T2DM learn and sustain healthy lifestyle
behaviors and master complex disease management skills. Access to DSME/S is limited such that
participation in DSME/S programs is as low as 7% of all adults with T2DM. New technologies supporting
DSME/S programs are emerging, but most fail to meet the unique needs of older adults with limited
technology fluency, creating a new digital divide. The See Yourself Health (SYH) team aims to bridge this
digital health gap for older adults with a newly designed immersive learning program – the HOPE APP –
designed to deliver diabetes care, DGV, and DSME/S on demand, tailored for older adults with diabetes and
accessible on mobile devices commonly used by this age group.Fortunately, new cloud gaming technology and advances in user interface design will enable our
team to design a new immersive learning environment tailored for mobile devices to offer DSME/S to meet
the needs and capabilities of older adults. HOPE App consists of 28 actionable DSME/S modules and
maintenance programming designed for a virtual world using social gaming strategies that emphasize peer
support, brain health, and mastery of diabetes self-management skills to allow users to connect with others
and simulate new lifestyle behaviors. Phase I Project: We aim to assess the feasibility, acceptability and
usability of the newly designed See Yourself Health immersive learning DSME/S solution – the HOPE APP -
tailored for older adults with diabetes featuring an adapted human interface for use with mobile device by
users with low technology fluency. Specific Aim 1: We will design and build the HOPE APP with educational
content, simulation experiences, and a user interface tailored for use by older adults with T2DM. Specific
Aim 2: To assess the usability of the HOPE APP using the Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation (RITE)
method with a total of 20 participants from the target population of adults 65+ with diabetes. Specific Aim 3:
To test the feasibility of using the HOPE APP by SYH by older adults on mobile devices. Plan for Phase II:
Once we demonstrate the feasibility of delivering the See Yourself Health DSME/S program using a cloud
gaming solution, we aim to assess the effects of the platform on cognitive function, physical health, and
mental health outcomes in a fully powered clinical trial.Project Narrative:

GERD is the inability of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) to keep the acidic stomach content from coming back up excessively into the esophagus that can cause major discomfort, disrupting daily lives and can lead to esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, strictures, and cancer. 40 million U.S. GERD patients manage their symptoms by life-long prescription medications such as Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) of whom 16 million will need other options due to either ineffectiveness or side effects. GERD is the most expensive of all the GI diseases, with an annual U.S. healthcare cost >$12 billion and growing. Due to its risks and significant physiological perturbations, the gold standard fundoplication surgery treats <30 thousand patients. Ω-Cuff improves upon a less morbid partial fundoplication surgery by having a simpler, easier, safer and more durable treatment. A straightforward laparoscopic procedure places the Ω-Cuff directly onto the esophagus without altering anatomy or physiology. Ω-Cuff works symbiotically with the esophagus to mitigate dysphagia common to other surgical treatments, to reduce medication dependence and healthcare costs. We successfully completed the required preclinical safety tests. Ω-Cuffs were manufactured and implanted over the LES area in a 1-year, 24-pigs Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) study without adverse events. The device could be safely explanted. Ω-Cuff passed the panel of ISO 10993 biocompatibility, corrosion, nickel leaching, and fatigue cycling durability tests. It was also found to be MRI compatible at both the 1.5 and 3.0 Tesla levels, allowing patients to safely go through standard MRI diagnoses, if needed. An Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) has been granted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a clinical feasibility study. This proposal has the following aims. Specific Aim 1: Manufacture Ω-Cuff in 5 sizes for the clinical study. Per FDA mandate, we will manufacture 5 sizes (20 each) for the clinical study. Specific Aim 2: Conduct human clinical early feasibility study with 8 patients. The study is an observational, prospective, non- randomized, open label, feasibility study of patients receiving the Ω-Cuff device, to evaluate the safety of Ω- Cuff and its ability to reduce the GERD symptoms in augmenting the function of the LES. Specific Aim 3: Prepare report and document for an IDE amendment to expand into a pivotal study. The intent of this clinical feasibility study is to establish a basis for expanding into a pivotal study to complete the clinical validation process. Commercialization will commence after completion of the pivotal clinical study and receiving approval from the FDA to market Ω-Cuff in Phase III.",  ,,,,CLAUDE N TIHON,,6128294057,ctihon@comcast.net,,  ,

Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease are major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is
characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation and gut microbiota dysbiosis. IBD has been associated with
poor quality of life and often results in complications requiring hospitalizations and surgical procedures that
causes significant morbidity and financial losses in the US. In past decade, anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha
(TNF-a) have become the cornerstone of treatment for IBD, but the long-term use of these systemically
delivered biologics is often associated with the loss of effects and the risks of generalized immunosuppression.
To overcome the hurdles, we developed an oral immunotherapeutic lead, designated as FZ006, by utilizing a
probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii to deliver a potent bi-specific neutralizing antibody against human TNF-a to
the intestines in order to treat ulcerative colitis. In our preliminary studies, we generated a prototype of S.
boulardii strain secreting an anti-mouse TNF-a antibody (Sb-amTNF) and proof-of-concept data demonstrating
that oral Sb-amTNF significantly ameliorated dextran sodium sulfate and bacterial colitis in mice. In this Fast-
track SBIR, we will pursue the Specific Aim 1 in Phase I study to perform biochemical and genetic
characterization of FZ006. In Phase II studies, Aim 2 will investigate pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of
FZ006, and Aim 3 will perform IND-enabling preclinical efficacy evaluation of FZ006 in human TNF-a
transgenic mice. All proposed activities will be guided by an exceptional advisory/consultant team with
specialized expertise in business development, biologics regulation, product development and planning, and
clinical development. Upon the completion of the proposed studies, we will pursue Phase IIb for generating
GMP product of FZ006, GLP toxicology and IND submission. Our long-term goal is to develop a novel oral
yeast immunotherapy against UC, a chronic intestinal disorder that causes tremendous morbidity and financial
losses in the US and worldwide.Narrative

The global threat to food security and the need to deal with unpredictable climate conditions have opened the doors to advanced precision agriculture and vertical urban farming. Rapidly growing global populations, demand for higher agricultural yields with limited arable farmland drive demand for vertical farming and new technologies to expand access to this method of sustainable crop cultivation. The proposed system will reduce the burden on the environment by decreasing water, fertilizers and pesticides required to grow crops. These micro-farms will boost agricultural profitability by providing a reliable, sustainable food system with fresh, healthy, and eco-friendly produce. This reduces food waste and the environmental impact of the food supply chain while improving yields and nutritional density. This SBIR Phase II project advances a system with integrated environmental control, consumables management, alerting, and scheduling. Furthermore, the automated controls are continuously improved by using camera vision to estimate yield and machine learning to forecast yield and optimize the environmental variables. To make the system cost-effective, a novel multispectral camera will be developed to collect agricultural data. Using machine learning, the images collected will be correlated to the environmental variables, such as pH and nutrient concentration, so that those variables can be optimized to increase yields. In order to improve scheduling and logistics, the platform will track inputs such as seeds, nutrients, and pH solution, using sensors and QR codes to automate consumable replacement. Sensors and software checks will determine when component or human failure have occurred, before they lead to crop failure, leading to just-in-time component replacement and maintenance.

Every year, neurologists and emergency personnel perform over 400,000 diagnostic and therapeutic lumbar
punctures (LP) to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a vital fluid in the diagnosis and treatment of a myriad of
neurological diseases and disorders. Under standard care, LPs are performed in an inpatient environment at the
bedside. The procedure involves navigating a needle that can be up to 14 cm in length into a 3-6 mm target
window in the lumbar spine region. Physicians face the challenge of precise, accurate navigation and placement
of the needle to the target. Failure to collect a viable sample and procedure-related complications can lead to
misdiagnoses, treatment delays, and unnecessary and even dangerous procedures. Currently, the average
physician takes 3 attempts to correctly place the needle. The associated failure rate of the procedure is ~23.3%.
The failure rate rises to 50% in obese and scoliotic patients, for which the physician must navigate through
excess adipose tissue and difficult anatomy. Failure to collect CSF leads the use of fluoroscopic guidance, which
takes longer and subjects the patient and physician to ionizing radiation. Except for fluoroscopic guidance, the
current standard of care does not involve any visualization of tissue using technology such as topical ultrasound.
In this phase I application, we propose a navigation system featuring a patient-anchored ultrasound patch which
transforms LPs from a blind procedure with high failure rate to a fast and simple one. Our solution addresses the
typical shortcomings of regular ultrasound guidance which has limited its wide adoption for LPs. The patch
ultrasound relieves the clinician from handling the ultrasound and needle simultaneously, yields high-contrast
images of the vertebrae pathway, and provides a reliable 3D volume. The navigation system with augmented
reality helps the clinician to successfully reach the target on the first try. Most importantly, the combination of
these technologies offers what we call active needle visualization, where the imaging plane of the ultrasound is
controlled to provide an optimal view of the needle in a closed-loop system. Our hypothesis in this proposal is
that the simplicity of the patch design and the availability of off-the-shelf navigation components combined with
Clear Guide’s matured navigation platform promises a cost-effective solution suitable for the clinical application
at hand. We will achieve our goal through the following aims: (1) Develop and Integrate Patient-anchored
Ultrasound Imaging Patch with Clear Guide Medical Tracking System, (2) Interface Design and Incorporation
into a Tablet and head-mounted display (HMD), and (3) Accuracy Measurement and User Data Collection. The
ultimate goal of this academic (Johns Hopkins University) and industry (Clear Guide Medical) collaboration is
the safe, economic, and effective development of patient-anchored ultrasound patch to actively guide LP
procedures.PROJECT NARRATIVE

responses to vaccine antigens; our preliminary data gives us strong confidence they may be
similarly effective in enhancing effectiveness of a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine, especially in
aged populations. This study will directly test the hypothesis that a novel, proprietary integrin
activator (7HP349) delivered with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (RBD containing domain)
vaccine candidate will generate high titer neutralizing antibodies that will yield protective
outcome (neutralization) post challenge with viral agents. Our premise is that 7HP349 can be
used as oral immune activator to augment systemic immunity of vaccines as a prophylactic tool
to control spread of SARS-CoV-2. It is furthermore envisioned to be used with an existing
vaccine without requiring antigen reformulation. Our ultimate goal is to ameliorate coronavirus
burden and subsequent COVID-19 disease in both adult and aged individuals.Narrative
On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a global Coronavirus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The disease is characterized by severe flu-like symptoms,
with advanced age (andgt;65 years) an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2-induced death. Current
clinical stage CoV-2 vaccine programs must include this important and vulnerable population in
their initial testing, and generate rapid antibody and cellular specific responses to combat
disease. Our proposal investigates the effectiveness of 7HP349 in conjunction with a COVID-19
vaccine candidate. The ultimate goal is to ameliorate coronavirus burden and subsequent
COVID-19 disease in both adult and aged individuals.",  ,,,,UPENDRA  MARATHI,,(832) 439-6612,upendra@7hills.co,,  ,

Radical Dosimetry for Real-Time Assessment of Protein Footprinting Radical Yield” is
responsive to the ackowledged need for new and improved tools for higher order
structural analysis (HOS) of biopharmaceuticals and membrane protein target studies.
An emerging HOS analysis technique is hydroxyl radical foot-printing (HRPF). HRPF
involves the irreversible labeling of a protein’s exterior by reaction with hydroxyl radicals
with subsequent MS analysis to identify the outer portions of the protein. We have
developed commercial solutions to perform HRPF. Recently a new and valuable
footprinting technique that relies upon trifluoromethyl (TFM) radicals created by OH
radical attack of aqueous sodium triflinate has been developed that shows great promise
when combined with HRPF. TFM protein footprinting (TFMPF) is highly complementary
to HRPF, as TFMPF effectively labels amino acid residues that are relatively “silent” to
OH radical attack. When used together, HRPF and TFMPF provide substantial coverage
and detection of solvent accessible residues, and as such represent a transformative
improvement to biopharmaceutical HOS assessment.The practice of TFMPF has been pioneered by Professor Michael Gross of
Washington University, St. Louis, Mo. While showing great promise to address unmet
challenges in pharmaceutical research, reproducibility for TFMPF is challenged by
variability of background scavenging. Collaborating with the Gross laboratory, our work
will extend our innovative HRPF radical dosimetry technology to TFMPF. GenNext
Technologies is the only company commercializing products for HRPF HOS analysis.
Our goal is to convert the combined use of HRPF and TFMPF process from an
academic research experiment into a valuable analytical tool. Once simplified and
transformed into a robust technique, we envision the facile combination of HRPF and
TFMPF to enable: paratope and epitope the interaction of mAb biopharmaceuticals with
their membrane targets; elucidate the dynamics of lead binding to orthosteric or
allosteric membrane targets; to reveal secondary messenger signaling cascades of
GPCR lead compounds; and to detect the impact of orthosteric / allosteric anti-
neoplastics upon targets such as kinases and growth factors.The importance of biopharmaceuticals and membrane protein targets has created a
need for improved analytics to facilitate biopharmaceutical research. Our Phase I SBIR
proposal will create an improved means to study the higher order structure of
bipharmaceuticals and their intended druggable targets in the context of facilitating
proteomics and pharmaceutical research and development. Upon successful completion
of our program, we will demonstrate the transformative nature of our new technology to
positively impact biopharmaceutical research.",  ,,,,SCOT R WEINBERGER,,(650) 728-0158,sweinberger@ix.netcom.com,,  ,

develop mobile technology for increasing access to evidence-based healthcare. 2Morrow’s programs use
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a behavioral approach that helps guide users through unhelpful
thoughts, feelings and urges. Using ACT, we have created and marketed highly successful self-management
programs for multiple disorders including chronic pain. Proposed Product: We have learned from our Chronic
Pain Self-Management Program that ACT reduces anxiety disorders and depression which typically accompany
chronic pain and provides the patient with coping strategies for managing their CP. These CP-associated
problems challenge primary care providers (PCPs) who do not have the capacity to manage the mental health
and behavioral components of chronic pain. To address these challenges, we will develop a new product, 2MRx-
CP, a Prescription Digital Therapeutic (PDT), that will combine our established ACT protocols for CP
management with screening tools for SUD, anxiety, and depression. It will also include: 1) behavioral science
content; and 2) remote patient monitoring (RPM) that evaluates CP patient outcome metrics and sends them to
a Provider Dashboard to inform PCPs. We are seeking a Fast-Track SBIR Application as 2Morrow has already
established itself in the digital health realm and will use their existing platforms to inform our 2MRx-CP product
development. Our 4 Phase I specific aims are: 1) Conduct a quantitative evaluation of the existing 2Morrow
Chronic Pain Self-Management Digital Health Program to address dissemination and implementation variables
of appropriateness, acceptability, and feasibility; 2) Conduct a qualitative study of PCP Core Teams to: a)
determine best fit PCP clinic types for 2MRx-CP for the Phase II clinical study andamp; our marketing strategy; and b)
initiate development of the Provider Dashboard; 3) To initiate development of our new prescription-based digital
program, 2MRx-CP, by reviewing data collected in Aims I-1 and 2, then developing a paper protocol of program
core elements; and 4) 2Morrow will contract consultants to complete an audit of our current quality management
processes and procedures to inform the formalized Phase II QMS implementation. Our 4 Phase II specific aims
are: 1) Conceptually design and build 2MRx-CP by incorporating the outcomes from Phase I to create final
content, screening tools, algorithms, and user experiences in an FDA compliant QMS IOS and Android mobile
application; 2) Conduct a clinical trial of 20 providers and 100 patients, as determined by our power analysis,
that will focus on impact of app use on change in primary patient reported outcomes and to describe patient
reported implementation outcomes: 1) patient outcomes on pain interference, function, depression, and anxiety,
and 2) implementation outcomes on acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, costs, and sustainability
of use by patients; and 4) Conduct Likert-based on-line surveys of PCP use of the Provider Dashboard each

PC is one of the lethal forms of cancer and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the US. Chemotherapy is the first-line standard treatment for cancer therapy. The medications used during chemotherapy are administered through an intravenous infusion (IV), pill, or injection. Once these medications enter the bloodstream, they destroy the cancerous cells and the healthy cells. The most common side effects for patients are nausea, vomiting, hair loss, and decreased immunity leading to a low quality of life. Our prototype aims to reduce chemotherapy side effects and the need for in-hospital chemotherapy administration, significantly reducing healthcare costs. The proposed innovative technology offers an alternative to direct surgical resection in the sensitive areas surrounding the pancreas. This treatment will extend the number of patients who can benefit from surgery and increase the overall success of surgeries primarily by preventing local relapse. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will lay the essential foundation for understanding the medical device product's physical and chemical characteristics. Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a ""silent"" disease because it is diagnosed at a much later stage when cancer has already metastasized. One of the significant challenges associated with PC treatment is the standard administration techniques (e.g., intravenous injection, oral administration) cannot efficiently deliver a therapeutic concentration of the drug to the tumor site because of the pancreas' anatomy. The innovative technology used in this prototype device will render it as an implantable, biodegradable, drug-eluting product allowing for spatio-temporal control and delivery of various active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) directly to the tumor site. Further, reductions in global toxicity and access to traditionally unresectable areas may enable higher concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents than could be tolerated by systemic administration, significantly altering the treatment landscape. This project will address the following four technical challenges related to the formulation and physical characteristics of the prototype, which will determine its release profile and the 3D printing mechanism, and its impact on the device's quality. The research and development routes that are being pursued include (1) assessment of prototype mechanical profile, starting with one API of interest (2) assessment of different polymer compositions and how they impact the flow of the printing material and resolution; (3) testing the use of fluorophores during the formulation of the prototype (4) assessment of different properties of the print material (e.g., pressure, print-head type, temperature, and viscosity) on the quality of the prototype.

(CHOP) and Akron Children’s Hospital (ACH) to develop processes to manufacture better fitting masks and
nasal prongs for Non-invasive Ventilation (NIV) delivery to young pediatric patients (1 month to 9 years of age).
NIV provides breathing support without the use of an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube. NIV is delivered by
interfaces (a mask or nasal prongs). Generally, masks only cover the nose to mitigate potential aspiration
concerns should a patient vomit. Nasal prongs are intended to achieve a 100% occlusive fit within a patient’s
nare. For both masks and prongs, the goal is to deliver airway support maintaining positive-end expiratory
pressure (PEEP). Poorly fitting masks can lead to non-compliance, patient–ventilator dys‐synchronies, skin
damage, pain, craniofacial skeletal issues, and can also result in delivery of sub-optimal pressures or tidal
volume, which can adversely affect ventilation outcomes, particularly in the home care setting. Additionally,
poorly fitting NIV interfaces can require them to be strapped to patients tightly to offset the inferior fit, which can
lead to pressure ulcers, skin damage, or septum injury (in the case of nasal prongs). While many NIV delivery
methods exist for neonatal patients (3 available mask and 11 nasal prong sizes), there are no sizes designed
specific to young pediatric patients (1 month to 9 years old) that are equipped with appropriate headgear. The
validation process to stand up a manufacturing approach is costly and time consuming for a relatively small
market, limiting the interest of major manufacturers to fill these gaps. Three main limitations arise when
addressing the needs of younger patients: 1) the size gap between neonatal and adult interfaces leave poor
solutions for young pediatric patients, 2) variation in patient facial structure results in NIV interfaces being
pushed too firmly against the face in an attempt to eliminate or reduce air leakage, and 3) craniofacial
anomalies (CFAs) (e.g. cleft lip) further limit the ability to achieve a good seal. An approach is needed that will
produce NIV interfaces that address these gaps, while being FDA-compliant and still economically feasible.
Phase I. Hypothesis. Pediatric-specific sized NIV mask and prongs can be manufactured using 3D printing
methods to improve ventilation outcomes in benchtop models. Aim 1. Verify improved performance of
pediatric-sized NIV devices fabricated through facial scanning and injection molding process. Aim 2 –
Formulation development and testing for direct 3D printing approach.
Phase II. Hypothesis. Manufacturing NIV devices with 3D printing yields better fitting interfaces that improve
NIV outcomes in young pediatrics. Aim 3 – Validate manufacturing approach for pediatric NIV interfaces. Aim 4
– Finalize direct 3D print approach and evaluate performance with CFAs. Aim 5 – Multi-site human clinical
evaluations (CHOP, n=29; ACH, n=24)Project Narrative:
Relevance – Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is used to provide breathing support without the challenges
encountered with an endotracheal tube. NIV is delivered either by masks or prongs. A tight seal is critical, but
without having to pull the mask so tight that it generates pressure sores. While many NIV options exist for
neonatal patients, options are poor for pediatric patients age 1 month to 9 years. This SBIR project develops
and tests Patient Specific Pediatric Nasal Prongs and Masks produced using conventional molding and 3D
printing. The goal is to provide a) a better range of sizes for pediatrics and b) patient specific ventilation for
unusual facial structures (e.g. cleft lip, midface hypoplasia).",  ,,,,ROGER B BAGWELL,,(814) 355-0003,roger.bagwell@actuatedmedical.com,,  ,

Currently, there are no therapeutic solutions for foot-drop, only assistive devices (braces, canes, electrical stimulation) that don't reverse the underlying ankle deficits. In contrast to arm robotics, lower extremity robotics have been largely unsuccessful in stroke patients to date, we posit because they do not emphasize volitional engagment for mediating motor learning. We pioneered modular ankle robotics technology, enabling human-robotics cooperative learning utilizing impedance control for deficit severity adjusted assist-as-needed in conjunction with adaptive control for precise timing of assistance to sub-events across the gait cycle. Our five positive clinical studies using this tethered research device show hemiparetic ankle motor learning that translates into improved over-ground gait. Most importantly, our randomized study shows that 18 sessions of ankle robotics integrated treadmill training (but not seated robot training) durably reverses foot drop, restores paretic leg propulsion, and promotes safer heel-first foot landing during unassisted walking, enabling 85% to self-discard their ankle braces or switch to a less dependent assistive device. Inspired by our findings that ankle robot mediated functional motor learning is most effectively conducted in the context of locomotor task-oriented training, we pursue finalization of a lighter weight and ergonomic portable ankle robot (AMBLE) that meets portability and clinical usability standards for untethered wear into regular mobility focused physical therapy (PT). Phase I produces a commercial portable ankle robot with desired portability (device mass, battery life); hardware design (FDA freeze)-microcontroller software (FDA compliant); and adequate clinical usability (client-therapist performance report card, auto-adjustable assistance) that meets key safety, stability, and comfort metrics (don-disengage time, slippage, part failure, skin abrasions/irritations) during over-ground walking and mobility tasks for full integration into physical therapy. Commercial units meeting FDA requirements will reach design freeze the first year (Phase 1); feasibility of which is supported by our precedent battery operated version already showing proof-of-function in stroke patients. Using AMBLE as a therapeutic device, optimized by the robot's intrinsic measurement capacities, we shift the robotics rehabilitation paradigm beyond repetitive robot guided exercise task practice, toward immersive PT integrated robotics (PTR). Phase II (3-yrs) is a blinded, randomized clinical trial investigating the hypothesis that 9 weeks (18 sessions) of PTR is more effective than PT alone to reverse foot drop as assessed by gait biomechanics (ankle angle at initial contact, peak swing ankle angle, number of heel-first strikes - % total steps, gait velocity; secondary outcomes- 3D gait biomechanics, daily ambulatory activity ) and blinded clinician assessment (dorsiflexion active range of motion, ankle muscle strength, assistive device needs).

The proposed reactor runs on electricity, not fuel, creating novel business model opportunities. One example is building and selling small-scale, distributed methanol production plants that can utilize intermittent renewable electricity sources for their energy source. Large industrial plants, such as refineries, that have a source of waste CO2 can utilize the proposed technology to make and sell methanol.

Improving Anticoagulation Monitoring in Pediatric Patients: Use of a Microfluidic Platform to Test Low VolumeBlood Samples Obtained by Heel-Stick Collection(HL140662 Phase IIB SBIR)
Anticoagulation therapy is indicated for children who suffer from congenital heart defects, thrombosis, or who
are at risk of developing thrombosis. Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of
anticoagulation therapies in pediatric patients, with up to 15% of hospitalized children receiving heparin or
heparinoids. The use of these therapies necessitates frequent laboratory testing (every 4 hours) of multiple
analytes -- anti-thrombin function (ATIII), Factor Xa activity (Xa), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)
-- to avoid underdosing (thrombotic events) or overdosing (bleeding). Existing diagnostics for heparin therapy
are problematic in newborns and children as they are generally standardized for adult samples and require as
much as 2 mL of whole blood per analyte or a cumulative blood volume of up to 12 mL per day for the full panel.
There is a critical unmet need to develop a low-volume, minimally invasive, and rapid turn-around diagnostic test
panel for monitoring heparin therapy in children that features multiple analyte testing on a single platform.
Work completed through Phase I and II of this project (R44HL140662) has established feasibility to perform a
panel of three critical assays (ATIII, Xa, and aPTT) for laboratory quality monitoring of anticoagulants (heparin,
heparinoids) on our near patient digital microfluidic platform (FINDER). This platform was recently CE marked
for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) testing and is pending 510(k) clearance from the FDA. The
proposed Phase IIB project will support full analytical validation per CLSI guidelines and a rigorous clinical
validation necessary to obtain FDA clearance for our heparin assay panel. We are preparing to engage in a pre-
submission with the FDA regarding our validation protocols and design of the validation studies to meet 510(k)
requirements based on single test predicate devices for each analyte. We are working closely with our clinical
partners at Boston Children’s Hospital to optimize the heparin testing platform workflow for seamless integration
into a hospital laboratory setting upon commercialization.
Funding through this Phase IIB mechanism will complete the developmental path for our FINDER heparin
monitoring platform, from concept to market through anticipated FDA clearance. There is currently no single
point-of-care testing platform available that supports rapid testing of ATIII, Xa, and aPTT. The small volume
format inherent to our digital microfluidic technology enables all three assays to be performed with less than 50
L of whole blood or plasma, collected via heel-stick or venipuncture, and is perfectly suited for use in pediatric
settings where frequent blood draws significantly increase the risk of iatrogenic anemia. By combining three
technically complex assays into a single, automated platform, we can improve both technical performance of
heparin monitoring assays (reduced sample-to-answer time, three analyte test results from a single blood
sample) and improve clinical outcomes through reduced blood volume needed for recurrent testing of heparin
and other anticoagulants.",  ,,,,VAMSEE K PAMULA,,(919) 891-0432,vpamula@baebies.com,,  ,

Thermosets such as silicones, epoxies, and urethanes are used across manufacturing because they have excellent chemical, physical, and mechanical properties, and they can be readily molded. The proposed technology will enable 3D printing of existing industrial thermosets without modifications using standard 3D printing technologies available in the market. The technology addresses an unmet need for industries including consumer electronics, automotive, aerospace, and medical device by enabling additive manufacturing of qualified thermoset materials for new applications such as improving the fit and comfort of wearable electronic devices, lightweighting mechanical components, and integrating sensors into flexible medical devices. This effort directly supports advancing national health and defense capabilities through new additive manufacturing capabilities. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I is focused on 3D printing a wide range of previously unprintable or difficult-to-print thermally-cured, thermoset materials. The impact will be unlocking a method of 3D printing thermosets without geometric limits while maintaining dimensional accuracy across features as small as 50 µm, addressing unmet additive manufacturing needs within consumer electronics, automotive, aerospace, and medical device industries. While there are current 3D printers that can utilize photopolymerization to print specific resins, most engineering thermosets (e.g. silicones, epoxies, and urethanes) remain unprintable. This project will implement a scientific framework to understand polymer-solvent interactions during freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels (FRESH) printing of thermoset inks within yield-stress support baths. In this process, liquid thermoset inks are extruded within a support bath where they are cured over time, making solubility, chemistry, and rheology critical success factors. Platinum-cured silicone is proposed as the initial candidate thermoset; the project will establish which block copolymers and solvents possess the right combination of solubility parameters to self-assemble into microgels that can be compacted to form the yield-stress support bath. FRESH printing process parameters will be optimized to achieve critical dimensional accuracy, resolution, fidelity, and mechanical properties of the printed parts.

replicate in the host, causing damage to surrounding tissue. Several of these protein aggregates are
strongly associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as the prion protein in prion diseases,
Amyloid β and tau in Alzheimer’s (AD), TDP-34 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and α-synuclein (αS) in Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with
Lewy bodies (DLB) and Multiple Systemic Atrophy (MSA). The molecular mechanisms behind the in
vivo formation of these aggregates and their effect on neural tissue remain elusive, but their
compelling implication as early drivers of the disease processes identifies them as potentially useful
disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets. The primary goal of this proposal is to perform robust
analytical validation of a Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification (PMCA) assay for detection of αS
aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma of patients with synucleinopathies. The PMCA
platform uses the intrinsic self-replicating nature of misfolded protein aggregates to cyclically amplify
minute quantities of αS aggregates in biological samples. The assay is performed in a 96-well plate,
and the amplification is monitored over time using the fluorescent amyloid-specific dye, ThioflavinT.
Method development is focused on robustness to support future use in a controlled laboratory with
high sample throughput and strict requirements for assay accuracy and reproducibility. Analytical
validation will be performed in accordance with FDA and Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI)
recommendations, using a combination of clinically positive patient samples and samples spiked with
synthetically generated aggregates to evaluate method accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity,
reportable range, and other critical assay characteristics. The overall objectives for phase I are to
finalize standard operating procedures and protocols and perform analytical validation of
qualitative/semi-quantitative αS-PMCA assays for detection of αS oligomers in CSF and plasma for

Claremont BioSolutions, LLC (CBIO)
The ability to sequence and map long stretches of DNA and RNA using third generation sequencing
technologies is set to transform the field of genomics and allow researchers and clinicians unparalleled insight
into the complexities of our genome and diseases. However, the move to these platforms presents new
hurdles in long DNA and RNA sample preparation. Most conventional spin column sample preparation
methods shear DNA during purification, and although agarose plug digestion methods can isolate ultra-long
DNA from samples, the protocols can be difficult, time consuming and highly variable. While newer
technologies have emerged that allow for more rapid extraction of long-DNA, these kits are either limited in use
to easy-to-lyse sample types (cells and blood) or require extra equipment and long processing times, which
significantly increases the cost. At Claremont BioSolutions (CBio), we are developing a novel automated
extraction technology that will incorporate lysis, nucleic acid binding and isolation. The technology will allow
users to add and sample, hit “GO” and in 30 minutes collect DNA or RNA. In Aim 1, we will integrate our fast
lysis and isolation technology into an automated cartridge to provide reproducible high quality, ultra-long DNA
or RNA extraction. In Aim 2, we will validate automated ultra-long DNA extraction using easy and complex
sample types, compare our technology to HMW DNA competitor's kits, and demonstrate improved long-read
sequencing using two third generation technologies. In Aim 3 we will test automated RNA extraction and
downstream native RNA sequencing. In Aim 4 we will perform pre-market analysis at off-site alpha and beta
testing facilities to generate end-user feedback and lockdown the design. The proposed system would simplify

dollar pharmaceutical sector with continued development of agents. Thanks to combination antiretroviral
therapy (cART, in which 2 to 4 ARVs are given, simultaneously) HIV+ people have a near-normal life-span.
HIV+ pregnant women also receive cART, and their children are given cART prophylactically at birth (in
general, cART is given to all HIV+ infants and children). For all HIV+ patients, if cART is stopped, HIV
replication restarts; thus, HIV+ people must remain on cART for the rest of their lives. For HIV+ adults, ARVs
are present during aging, in which loss of central nervous system (CNS) neurons contributes to loss of
cognition/dementia. For HIV+ infants and children, ARVs are present during neurodevelopment. HIV+
individuals frequently develop HIV-Associated Cognitive Disorders (HAND), which includes HIV-associated
dementia (HAD,common in AIDS), and less severe forms (asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment and mild
neurocognitive disorder (MND). While cART has reduced the incidence of HAD, ANI and MND remain at high
levels, even when HIV load is very low. In fact, certain ARVs may contribute to HAND, and alarmingly,
HIV+children on cART exhibit developmental delays in intellectual performance. Also, HIV infects/replicates in
microglia (MG), an innate immune cell of the CNS, and MG are out of the reach of ARVs that are poor at
crossing the blood:brain barrier. More brain-penetrant ARVs were developed, but, unexpectedly, these are
linked to greater incidence of HAND. Preclinical research on ARV neurotoxicity has been conducted on primary
rodent neurons and glial. Our goal is to develop an assay system (dubbed the hCNS-HIV/ARV platform) for
testing ARVs for neurotoxicity and efficacy at inhibiting HIV, neurons, MG and astrocytes (another glial cells),
derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-neurons, hiPSC-MG, and hiPSC-ACs). In phase I,
we developed methods for testing ARVs on hiPSC-neurons plated in 384-well dishes, utilizing high-throughput
digital microscopy/analysis. We found neurotoxicity (reductions in neurites, synapses, and calcium transients)
for elvitegravir (EVG, strongest effect, matching data with rat neurons), dolutegravir (DTG, linked to birth
defects), and tenofovir disoproxil fumerate (TDF) and certain combinations of ARVs representing cART had
stronger effects than the ARVs, alone. TDF also reduced the viability and elicited epigenetic changes in human
neural precursor cells (hNPCs), suggesting that TDF may affect neurogenesis, a process critical for
neurodevelopment and cognition. In phase II we will develop standard assay protocols/analysis methods for
testing ARVs and HIV infection, itself, on hiPSC-neurons/-MG/-ACs, and on hiPSC-NPCs. The hCNS-

Despite annual investments of rt$3 billion for intensive control measures, in 2018, the 228 million cases of
malaria were an increase of ~16 million cases over 2015, and no decrease in number of deaths. The impact of
available malaria control measure has plateaued. Moreover, WHO estimates deaths from malaria could double
across sub-Saharan Africa this year due to disruptions in access to control measures due to the current global
COVID-19 pandemic malaria. New tools, especially a vaccine, are needed. Only broad deployment of an
effective vaccine holds the promise of true elimination or eradication, especially in the face of sudden
developments like COVID-19. More than 98% of all deaths from malaria are caused by Plasmodium falciparum
(Pf). Thus, a vaccine against Pf malaria is the priority. Sanaria is moving in 2021 to Phase 3 clinical trials of its
Pf sporozoite (SPZ), PfSPZ Vaccine, and is planning for marketing authorization (licensure) from FDA and
EMA in 2022/2023. Over the next 5-10 years we aim to decrease the cost of goods (COGs) and efficiency of
production of PfSPZ vaccines so they can be used most effectively and economically by individuals who suffer
the most from malaria. Microdissection of mosquitoes is a crucial step in extraction of PfSPZ vaccine products,
and ensures a 10,000-fold purification away from irrelevant mosquito parts as the starting material for
downstream purification procedures that then achieve a final product purity of 99.9%. To-date, mosquito
salivary gland PfSPZ have demonstrated in vivo infectivity/potency superior to those extracted from whole
mosquitoes, or grown outside a mosquito. However, extraction of mosquito salivary glands is a rate-limiting,
labor-intensive, expensive step in production of PfSPZ-based vaccines. The overarching aim of this proposal is
to enable implementation of an interim semi-automated dissection device in cGMP production of PfSPZ-based
vaccines against malaria, and develop an integrated dissection system incorporating multiple automation steps
downstream of mosquito orientation, for commercial-scale manufacturing. The unique application of robotic
technology, state-of-the art computer vision and machine learning algorithms, and software systems to
production-scale processing of very small insects in cleanrooms not only advances manufacturing capabilities,
but also represents a spectrum of milestone innovations in automation. Success in this project involving a
highly-skilled multi-disciplinary team of investigators, manufacturing and quality experts will decidedly lead to
further streamlining and process optimization during the key step of isolating mosquito salivary glands for
manufacture of our highly effective PfSPZ-based vaccines. The breakthroughs that initially defined a vaccine
that is far superior to competing technologies in both safety and protective efficacy, will continue, as we
advance in the proposed studies to make vaccine extraction more cost-effective due to greater efficiencies,
mitigation of human error and operator fatigue, reduced timeframes, greatly reduced training periods, and
increased product purity, towards deployment of a highly-impactful tool in the fight against malaria.",  ,,,,STEPHEN L HOFFMAN,,(240) 299-3178,slhoffman@sanaria.com,,  ,

Alzheimerandapos;s disease (AD) afflicts nearly six million people in the United States (U.S), and this number is
expected to double by 2050. Disease modifying medical therapies for AD continue to be an unmet need. The
symptomatic treatments currently available regulate neurotransmitter levels, slowing cognitive decline for an
average of only 6 months.
Cognition Therapeutics (CogRx) is developing CT1812, the first brain penetrant small molecule that selectively
clears toxic beta amyloid oligomers (AβOs) from the brain into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CT1812andapos;s mechanism
of action has the potential to halt or slow cognitive decline, significantly alleviating AD progression.
CT1812 is currently in Phase 2 trials in patients. Before CogRx can proceed to larger and longer studies that
evaluate efficacy, a human Absorption, Metabolism, and Excretion (AME) study must be conducted per Food
and Drug Administration expectations, to establish a robust and comprehensive knowledge of CT1812andapos;s
pharmacokinetics (PK) and key metabolites.
Approach. The overall research design will include (Aim 1) purifying and characterizing radiolabeled CT1812
in sufficient quantities with sufficient quality; (Aim 2) conducting an open-label AME clinical trial in which up to
six healthy male volunteers are given oral [14C]-CT1812, followed by plasma, urine and feces collection for up
to 14 days, and (Aim 3) analyzing samples to determine mass balance recovery, PK, and identification and
quantification of the relative abundances of the metabolites.
CogRxandapos;s long-term objective is to develop CT1812 as a potential disease-modifying therapeutic for AD
treatment. Because no AD disease-modifying therapies exist currently, CT1812 would significantly advance AD
treatment armamentarium.

The proposed technology will enable application of sufficient sunscreen in a timely manner, thereby helping to minimize the incidence of ultraviolet-related skin damage including sunburn, age-related photodamage and skin cancer—the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States with an annual estimated treatment cost of $8.1 billion. For consumer end-users, this technology will provide an affordable, convenient, and accurate sunscreen effectiveness indicator to help keep them sun-safe.

Therefore, the first aim of this project is to determine the photoaction spectrum of the chromophore by spectrofluorometry and compare it to the Erythemal Response Curve—the relative type and intensities of ultraviolet radiation that cause sunburns. The second aim will be to validate the chromophore will accurately change color when SPF levels drop below SPF 10-15 across a range of sunscreens of variable broadband (UVA/UVB) protection. Finally, since the chromophore is applied directly to skin via a carrier ink, industry standard cosmetic safety tests will be conducted to ensure the chromophore is safe for skin application.

affecting all levels of the American way of life. The opioid crisis has emerged from multiple fronts. Among these
various fronts, the continued use of opioids in the post-operative area is a growing addiction risk. Current post-
operative pain management utilizes a multimodal pain management strategy, which includes opioids and non-
opioids (NSAIDs). These two treatment strategies have significant health care cost implications due to their
adverse events and addiction risks. Opioids have serious adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting,
respiratory depression, urinary retention, hypotension, and long-term addiction risks. Non-opioids such as
NSAIDs, both in oral and parenteral formulations, are an essential part of a multimodal post-operative pain
management strategy for their opioid sparing capabilities. However, NSAIDs (Cyclooxygenase (Cox)-1/2
inhibitors) have serious adverse events such as GI bleeding, cardiovascular events, and systemic bleeding.
This current state of affairs has created an unmet need for an effective parenteral/oral analgesic for acute post-
operative pain management without the risks of opioid addiction. Salsalate, a dimer or salicylic acid, although a
non-FDA-approved drug, is currently available in oral dosage for the treatment of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid
arthritis. Salsalate works at multiple levels to target multiple steps along the surgical pain pathway. Salsalate
through its active metabolite, salicylic acid (SA), reduces NF-κB activation via IKK-kinase beta inhibition, and
has no direct binding to cyclooxygenase 1 (Cox-1); therefore, does not affect function of platelets, resulting in a
safer hematological and gastrointestinal safety profile 1. RH Nanopharmaceuticals (RH Nano) had a successful
Pre-IND application review for current oral salsalate through the FDA 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway to submit
an IND in the next few months. FDA has confirmed that salsalate is likely to be considered a new chemical
entity (NCE) for an initial New Drug Application (NDA). RH Nano has also developed a micronized version of
salsalate (M-salsalate) for oral and parenteral administration. Our preliminary testing shows that in comparison
with current oral salsalate, M-salsalate has an improved pharmacokinetic profile including a shorter Tmax,
higher Cmax, and larger area under the curve (AUC), resulting in enhanced biodistribution. It is expected to
have the same safety profile as the oral salsalate. The President’s Commission on “Combating Drug Addiction
and the Opioid Crisis” has recommended to the President of the United States that “individuals with acute or
chronic pain must have access to non-opioid pain management options”, and the National Institute on Drug
Abuse (NIDA) has a strong interest on “non-opioid medications to treat pain in outpatient subjects, including
opioid sparing strategies”. With these needs in mind, RH Nano proposes a plan for manufacturing and pre-
clinical testing of parenteral M-salsalate in two animal models to assess the efficacy and safety in the treatment
of acute postoperative pain management. In this proposal (Phase I), we will partner with Particle Sciences to
develop the optimal formulation under strict Chemistry Manufacturing and Control (CMC) guidelines. In Phase
II, we propose to conduct the pharmacokinetics and toxicology studies of M-salsalate in two species of animals
(rodent and non-rodent) through a partnership with Calvert Labs. We will also use an animal pain model for
preclinical efficacy studies, and an in vivo Receptor Occupancy (RO) assay in animal brain tissues to assess
the opioid sparing properties of M-salsalate through a partnership with Melior Discovery. The results from
these experiments will enable us to generate adequate data for a Pre-IND FDA meeting for discussion of
clinical testing in humans.",  ,,,,JOEL S ROSS,,(908) 489-8760,jross@rhnanopharma.com,,  ,

This innovation will also reduce the healthcare-acquired infections from other pathogens that cause 1.7 million illnesses, 98,000 deaths and an estimated $45 billion annually in direct costs to US hospitals. Cross-contamination via hands and gloves is a leading cause of spread of pathogens and resulting infections. Handwashing and hand sanitizers provide periodic sanitation, however, cross-contamination via hands between periodic handwashing or sanitizing is an inherent risk. Likewise, donning fresh gloves helps ensure the gloves used are sanitary, but they become contaminated during use. Innovations described in this proposal provide continuous sanitation for hands between handwashing and between changes of gloves. Maintaining persistent antimicrobial activity for an extended period on hands and gloves of workers will reduce transmission of pathogens including SARS CoV-2. This research aims to develop cell-based antimicrobial compositions with diverse class of antimicrobials to coat both biotic surfaces (hands) and abiotic surfaces (gloves) for persistent antimicrobial activity. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to address the technical challenges in maintaining persistent antimicrobial activity on both biotic and abiotic surfaces against viral and bacterial targets including SARS CoV-2. The technical challenges include: (a) ability of antimicrobial compositions to persist on biotic and abiotic surfaces in the presence of organic content including proteins, lipids and cells as well as physical factors including sweat and mechanical forces; (b) achieving rapid inactivation of contaminating pathogens on complex surfaces such as hands and gloves; and (c) ensuring the biocompatibility of the compositions and removal with simple washing steps. To address these challenges this proposed research aims to develop innovations in the following technical areas: (a) discovery of cellular compositions and process engineering to stabilize diverse antimicrobials and maintain rapid inactivation of pathogens (b) development of nature inspired designs for retaining cell-based antimicrobial compositions on skin surfaces to maintain persistent antimicrobial activity (c) engineering polymer compositions to retain cell-based compositions on abiotic surfaces and (d) engineer cellular compositions to achieve rapid inactivation of these pathogens.

Tracheobronchomalacia, while a rare disease, is observed in up to 13% of adult patients who undergo
bronchoscopic examination for respiratory symptoms and up to 23% of patients with chronic bronchitis. Intrinsic
weakness of the cartilage and/or fibromuscular membrane leads to collapse resulting in air trapping and poor
gas exchange. Symptoms include labored breathing, episodic choking, chronic cough and periodic respiratory
infections. While continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can be used to prevent collapse, it is difficult to
perform everyday activities while using CPAP 24 hours a day. A number of surgical procedures have been
developed to reinforce the airways and so prevent collapse, but these involve major surgery and have high
complication rates. Alternatively, while stents can be used to prevent airway collapse, existing airway stents are
ineffective. Metal mesh stents induce the growth of granulation tissue through the mesh requiring a very invasive
removal procedure. To avoid this, solid silicone tubes have been developed, but they too have shortcomings.
They migrate easily along the airways and block mucociliary function over the length of the stent resulting in
mucous plugging. Resorbable stents are intended to overcome the challenge of removal, but stent fragmentation
during resorption can block distal airways. To address this clinical need, a Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH)
team, comprised of surgeons, pulmonologists and engineers, has created a helical stent technology and tested
it using in vivo animal experiments. These stents allow mucociliary flow and their screw-like shape prevents them
from migrating once positioned in the airways. They can also be removed with minimal damage even if
epithelialized using a novel bronchoscopic tool that employs an unscrewing motion to retract the stent from the
tissue and into a cannula for removal. The BCH team has joined forces with DFD Solutions to commercialize
this technology. As an initial step toward a 510(k) application, this project proposes two Specific Aims. In the first
aim, we will evaluate the efficacy and safety of our stent system in a malacic animal model matched the
dimensions of an adult human trachea. These 12-week experiments will be of sufficient duration to enable
evaluation of stent performance over a clinically relevant time period. Bronchoscopy will be used to evaluate
airway patency, the formation of granulation tissue, mucus clearance, stent migration and the ease of stent
removal. We will also employ histological techniques to assess tissue damage, granulation tissue, fibrosis and
inflammatory response. Aim 2 will focus on designing the stent and tools for clinical use by defining the critical
requirements and features that will enable use within existing clinical workflows. This will include conducting
human-factors research to obtain procedural and process maps for the system as well as engineering design to
define user / technical requirements and verification and validation testing plans. The conclusion of Aim 2 will
be an FDA pre-submission to obtain clarification on the appropriate regulatory pathway and required preclinical
and clinical testing to support pre-market clearance or approval.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Airways collapse during exhalation is a condition which is frequently observed in patients with asthma, chronic
bronchitis and emphysema. While airway stents exist, they have significant side effects and alternative
treatments are limited to 24-hour-a-day CPAP or major surgery. We are proposing to commercialize a novel
airway stent technology that overcomes the limitations of existing stents.",  ,,,,PIERRE E DUPONT,,(617) 919-3561,pierre.dupont@childrens.harvard.edu,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,  ,

This application is to support a clinical trial of the first mRNA engineered cell therapy for Acute
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), including ARDS caused by COVID-19. The FDA has
already reviewed the IND application and determined that the study may proceed. ARDS is a
severe inflammatory respiratory failure that kills an estimated 80,000 Americans each year. 80%
of ARDS patients require mechanical ventilation. No FDA-approved therapies for ARDS are
available. ARDS may result from infectious or non-infectious (e.g., traumatic or chemical) insults.
COVID-19 is currently the most common cause of ARDS, and the vast majority of COVID-19
deaths are due to ARDS. Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) drive the hyperactive
inflammatory response in ARDS and COVID-19, and presence of NETs correlates strongly with
ARDS severity. NETs are produced by locally-trafficked neutrophils undergoing NETosis, a
programmed cell death where the cells lyse to secrete DNA decorated with inflammatory proteins.
Low amounts of NETs are thought to help entrap infection, but hyperactivated neutrophils produce
large quantities of NETs that cause hypoxia and immune thrombi due to physical blockade of
alveoli and microvasculature. A NET-degrading therapy therefore would be a significant advance
in treatment of ARDS. Descartes-30 is the first allogeneic (i.e., off-the-shelf) engineered human
Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) therapy secreting a combination of two potent NET-degrading
enzymes. In this Phase 1/2a study, the hypothesis to be tested is that Descartes-30 will be well
tolerated and show evidence of efficacy in patients with moderate to severe ARDS and COVID-
19. Aims are to determine the maximum tolerated dose and evidence of preliminary efficacy,
define pharmacokinetic properties and biologic correlates of disease, and establish a validated
Potency assay for use in later-stage clinical development. These data will inform the design of a
controlled registration study in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS.",  ,,,,CHARLES A STEWART,,(301) 348-8698,andy.stewart@cartesiantx.com,,  ,

The current drug development process is lengthy, inefficient, and expensive. It costs about $1.8 billion and takes 12-15 years to launch a single drug. Approximately 92% of the drugs that passed preclinical testing failed in subsequent human trials, highlighting the lack of adequate preclinical testing tools to generate predictive data. Failure to detect the drug-induced toxicity to the vital human organs in clinical trials often leads to market withdrawal of the drug after launch, which causes enormous financial losses to the drug manufacturer and also negative physical and mental effects for patients. The proposed technology will significantly improve drug safety, increase the efficiency and lower the cost of drug development by providing more reliable and clinically relevant drug testing results in a high-throughput fashion. This technology can also provide patient-specific tissues for critical biomedical research (e.g. disease modeling) and in vivo therapeutic applications, providing a viable solution to diseases without no cures or effective treatment yet. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will support the development of a high-throughput biofabrication platform that is compatible with the high-throughput screening (HTS) systems widely used for drug screening and assay development. Currently, the key bottleneck for traditional microfabrication strategies and mainstream nozzle-based bioprinters is the lack of scalability and throughput to accommodate scalable manufacturing necessary in HTS systems. With the growing adoption of 3D biomimetic human tissue models in the pharmaceutical industry, there is a critical need for advanced manufacturing systems that enable rapid and streamlined tissue fabrication methods that are compatible with already established HTS platforms for preclinical toxicity testing of potential drug candidates. The proposed project will develop a parallel optical projection-based 3D bioprinting platform for direct manufacturing of 3D tissues within multiwell plates commonly used in the HTS systems. Implementation of the proposed 3D bioprinting system will permit subsequent in situ drug screening or assay testing directly within the wells and drastically improve biofabrication workflow efficiencies for the pharmaceutical industry and biomedical research community. This bioprinter will serve as a powerful instrument for the mass production of 3D tissue models at the industrial scale to advance drug discovery and assay development.

and economic toll on patients, families, caregivers, and society. This is in part due to our failure to develop
effective medications, reflecting drug discovery platforms that are often not relevant to target diseases. The
recent development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from humans makes it possible to screen and
validate candidate compounds on human brain cells, including those from patients, thus potentially increasing
the success rate and speeding the pace of CNS drug development.BrainXell, Inc. has pioneered the development of human patient brain cell-based platforms for CNS drug
discovery. We are able to produce large quantities of highly enriched microglia of consistent quality from human
iPSCs through our platform technology of directed differentiation and expansion of committed progenitors.
However, iPSC-derived microglia are immature, comparable to those at the fetal stage, which makes it difficult
for presentation of disease phenotypes and for high-throughput screening (HTS) for drug leads intended for
those whose brains are fully mature. The goal of this Phase I SBIR project is to uncover molecules that speed
the expression of genes associated with a mature state in iPSC-derived microglia and to formulate cocktails that
yield mature microglia within 1-3 weeks after plating. We will engineer a human iPSC reporter line with
nanoluciferase (Nluc) fused to P2RY12, a purinergic receptor highly expressed in mature microglia. This line will
enable and simplify the screening of small molecules for accelerating microglia maturation. Formulation of an
effective cocktail for rapidly generating mature human microglia will remove a major roadblock in establishing

This project uniquely combines two new technologies to eliminate the carbon dioxide emissions resulting from flaring of huge volumes of natural gas in remote oil fields; the technologies burn it in a novel combustion system and uses the generated heat to treat the oil-field produced water. The cooled flue gases of combustion are then injected via a novel process into oilfields for enhancing oil recovery. This makes the entire process economically feasible and environmentally beneficial. The proposed combustion system involves a novel concept of “Fire-in-Water” to carry out combustion of a fuel directly within a flowing stream of water, thereby enhancing the heat transfer coefficients by several orders of magnitude compared to conventional indirect heat transfer systems involving metallic heat transfer surfaces (such as shell-and-tube heat exchangers) separating the heated and heating media.

The proposed technology can reduce wildfire risk by cleaning up the forest undergrowth. Landfills in many states will be reaching maximum capacity in coming years and are under threat of being shut down: diverting landfill waste to the production of valuable products is much desired.

Opportunity - Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women. Several technologies are used for screening
and diagnosis of this disease: Mammography, Tomosynthesis, Ultrasound, and MRI. Mammography and Tomosynthesis
not only cause discomfort to patients, but their outcome is also dependent on the patient’s breast density: breast density is
associated with reduced detection sensitivity in both imaging techniques. Ultrasound has a low-resolution, is highly user-
dependent, and can be time-consuming; MRI is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. There is significant need,
therefore, for an imaging modality that addresses the limitations of the current screening and diagnostic imaging
technologies, prioritizes patient experience, and reduces health care costs of detecting cancer.
Solution - MALCOVA has designed and developed a minimum viable product of a Dedicated Breast CT system that
provides 3D images of both breasts, similar to breast MRI, in 30 seconds of scan time, at mammographic dose levels,
without applying breast compression. The scientific premise of our proprietary technology is based on narrow-beam CT
image acquisition - Malcova’s proprietary technology protected through two utility patents, already granted and fully owned
by Malcova.
The specific aims for the parent project of this I-Corps application are: Aim 1: Development of fluence modulation assembly
(this assembly modulates the fluence of x-rays to generate a narrow beam), Aim 2: Development of a line detector assembly
(which leads to preventing the acquisition of scattered photons), and Aim 3: Development of the image acquisition protocol
and synchronization of the beam modulation and line detector assemblies.
Achieving synchrony between these assemblies renders proof of concept of, and clarifies the unknowns for, decoupled
gantry development in Phase 2. So far, we have developed the image acquisition apparatus (see the following figure), and
are on track to finish the project on time (by the end of April 2022).

chest wall coverage and bilateral breast imaging. The final vision for our product is a simultaneous bilateral breast
cancer imaging platform ready for subsequent technology plug-ins such as integrated biopsy, computer aided

UV-curable polymeric-nanoparticle composite materials represent the current state-of-the-art to produce optical waveguide components for augmented and virtual reality (AVR) applications. These coatings often suffer from low-optical transmission, increased haze values, high coefficients of thermal expansion, and low-indices of refraction. This project develops UV-curable, inorganic films that exceeds the standards of currently used materials. This research project will focus on elucidating correlations between precursor formulation and film processing to control film thickness, refractive index, and optical transmission. The proposed research objectives will reproducibly demonstrate materials with controlled optical performance that that meets or exceeds the current state-of-the-art and establish a pathway for manufacturers to achieve device miniaturization.

The proposed AEF addresses the underlying cause of the disease by increasing activity of a protein that has been shown to do so in mice. The market for approved MTM therapeutics is likely to exceed $1 billion over the next few years once a safe and effective drug is approved. No current treatments exist for MTM, but two experimental drugs are currently being studied in clinical trials. The proposed AEF may play an important treatment role by overcoming immune reactions to other drugs and may be essential for chronic treatment later in life after other gene therapy effects have diminished. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to produce and deliver an important protein, BIN1, the exogenous delivery of which has been shown to rescue the molecular pathogenesis of the disease-causing MTM1 mutation in a mouse model. The key technical objectives of this project will demonstrate that Fab-BIN1 can be robustly produced using typical mammalian cell culture, penetrates disease-relevant cells, and restores abundance and phosphorylation levels of proteins known to be affected by disease-associated MTM1 mutations. The latter two goals will be accomplished by orthogonal methods immunofluorescence and Western blot, with a cell-penetrating antibody as an active negative control, and disease-recapitulating MTM1 knockout myoblasts as the in vitro test system. The anticipated outcome of this project will justify advancement of Fab-BIN1 to later-stage preclinical study.

This technology will significantly enhance the scientific understanding of cellular therapies, and enable the healing of injuries more rapidly and less invasively than current techniques. A significant need for this technology exists in the competition horse market. 98% of competitive horses suffer from soft tissue injuries and more than 80% develop suspensory ligament defects. Injuries to suspensory ligaments can take years to heal and are the leading cause of missed performances owners. The proposed technology provides veterinarians a means of healing suspensory ligament injuries significantly faster, resulting in fewer missed performances, reduced financial losses, and most importantly, improved quality of life for the animal. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will address the problem of slow healing suspensory ligament injuries for racehorses. 98% of vets use stem cell injections to aid in recovery of these injuries, but this strategy has limited efficacy due to poor viability of injected cells and short cell retention times at the site of injury. This problem is addressed by developing technology to preserve and localize mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) at an injury site through delivery in inert, injectable hydrogel microparticles. The research objectives of this proposal are twofold; 1. Quantitively assessing metrics of cell viability and stromal cell-like behavior of hydrogel microencapsulated cells and compare them to baseline unencapsulated cell metrics, and 2. Provide explicit evidence that the encapsulation process localizes cells and preserves their viability, is nontoxic and non-immunogenic, and demonstrates markers of superior tissue regeneration in a small animal model similar to that of its intended commercial use.

AbstractGenome-wide association studies have identified the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR146 as a
potential regulator of plasma cholesterol levels. Recent studies have demonstrated that depletion of GPR146 in
mice substantially reduces circulating LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels, through activation of ERK signaling
and promotion of SREBP2 activity. The lipid-lowering effects of GPR146 depletion by either genetic knock-out
or shRNA knock-down protected mice against atherosclerosis in an LDL receptor (LDLR)-independent manner,
reducing lesion area by up to 90%. These results strongly suggest that modulation of GPR146 signaling is a
viable therapeutic strategy for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) and potentially other
atherosclerotic conditions.The overall goal of this project is to identify and develop a human GPR146 monoclonal antibody (humAb) as
an innovative means to treat HoFH. In Phase 1, we will utilize our huFab on phage library to identify a human
mAb with high specificity for GPR146. Clones will be rank-ordered by their affinity and specificity using in vitro
assays relevant to cholesterol metabolism. Finally, we will evaluate function in vivo using a mouse model.
Production of a humAb with a nanomolar Kd, high specificity for GPR146, and ability to prevent atherosclerotic
plaque formation will merit submission of a Phase 2 application. Phase 2 work will focus on obtaining the
preclinical data necessary for submission of an IND. Pharmacokinetics and toxicity studies, as well as additional
animal studies to demonstrate safety and efficacy, will be performed.NarrativeFamilial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is a disorder of cholesterol metabolism that results in a high rate of
atherosclerosis and elevated risk of death from heart disease. Recent studies have identified a target for new
drug development, which can dramatically reduce the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. During this project,
we will develop a monoclonal antibody that can inhibit this target and provide the first efficacious treatment for

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the
developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin
supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual
acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be
effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant
cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier
stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients
themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool.
We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1%
of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals
would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM
has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant
telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural
areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the
aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for
the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market
is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best
accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and
prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s
improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition
to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from
remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics.",  ,,,,ALAUDDIN  BHUIYAN,,(718) 926-9000,bhuiyan@ihealthscreen.org,,  ,

The proposed project brings forestry within the scope of the emerging science of genome editing with powerful impacts. Enhanced traits allow commercial entities in pulp and paper manufacturing to save energy and chemical costs; a pulp and paper facility can potentially reduce costs by up to 6%, exceptional for an industry that provides everyday items, such as hygienic tissue and cardboard for deliveries, at thin profit margins. Furthermore, trees play an important role in carbon sequestration, but they need to survive the temperature changes and potential infestations. With the advance of the proposed technology, editing forests could eventually gain acceptance as a significant avenue to bioresource sustainability and carbon sequestration. The proposed project combines the insights of tree genetics with the power of genome editing to generate enhanced genotypes with functional attributes that improve tree growth, processing and sustainability. Based on an integrated predictive model of genes responsible for phenotypes of commercial interest in relevant species, it is possible to select combinations of genome editing targets responsible for enhanced phenotypes, such as lignin content and syringyl/guaiacyl ratio, to modulate the composition of trees as to increase their propensity for processing, their environmental resilience, or valuable commercial features. Using CRISPR-based genome editing technologies, the project will multiplex target these genetic sequences concurrently to generate the intended genetic alteration combinations, using expertise in delivery to commercially relevant elite germplasm. Conventional breeding in forestry is slow and cumbersome because the long generation time of trees requires decades per breeding cycle.

Tobacco use remains the leading preventable cause of death in the US, contributing to more than 480,000
premature deaths each year. The well-established Tobacco Treatment Guidelines and recently released
American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathway for tobacco cessation treatment
underscore the need to conceptualize tobacco use as a chronic substance use disorder and to offer any patients
who use tobacco products brief interventions that include prescriptions for proven pharmacological smoking
cessation aids and proactive connections to evidence-based behavioral support. The rapid expansion of smart
phone capabilities enhances the potential for tobacco cessation apps to personalize behavior change guidance
and to send contextually relevant tailored behavior change nudges based not just on readiness to quit, but also
based on electronic heath record (EHR) data. Rich data from EHRs are now available to third-party apps from
the Health app (iOS) via Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard Application
Programming Interface (API). The proposed research represents an innovative approach in that it will develop
and examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of FHIR-ed Up- a theoretically-grounded,
highly individualized tobacco cessation Health-Kit enabled app. Unlike existing tobacco cessation apps, FHIR-
ed Up will: 1) implement a full range of best practices in tailored health behavior change communications; 2)
individualize messaging based on Health app data and behavior change constructs; and 3) provide data and
key insights back to electronic health records via HL7 transmissions from the server-portion of the FHIR-ed
Up app. Developed in collaboration with interoperability and app development experts, FHIR-ed Up will
achieve sustained use by hyper-personalizing the user experience for patients and integrating actionable
insights seamlessly into the clinical workflow of their clinicians. Extensive end user and stakeholder input will
ensure FHIR-ed Up is designed for rapid dissemination. Potential end users (n=8 tobacco users aged 18 and
older) will be recruited via community and social media ads. Formative qualitative data will be combined with
input from four experts and five clinician stakeholders to develop a prototype of FHIR-ed Up. Iterative
usability testing (n=10) will allow the prototype to be refined before patients of an integrated delivery system
with an upcoming appointment (n=100) are recruited to participate in a 30-day pilot test. Pilot participants
will provide quantitative and qualitative data, and utilization and acceptability data will be examined. Pre-post
comparisons of psychosocial expectancies for smoking will provide preliminary data on the effects of the
program. Acceptability data from participating clinicians (n=5) who receive and deliver EHR prompts will also
be gathered. The results will inform program modifications needed to proceed with the Phase II effectiveness
trial. Phase II will provide the impetus for commercialization of a cost-effective, evidence-based, interoperable
app that has the potential to address tobacco use on a population basis.Relevance:
Effective tailored mobile applications for tobacco cessation that integrate seamlessly into
patients’ medical records are critical because smoking is a leading preventable cause of death
and disability in the US, taking the lives of 480,000 Americans each year and contributing costs
exceeding $300 billion annually. The proposed study will develop and test FHIR-ed Up, a
mobile app that 1) provides truly individualized behavior change guidance to end users based on
their tobacco use behaviors and pertinent medical data captured from their electronic health
record (EHR); and 2) pushes actionable insights back to the patient’s EHR for delivery by the
clinician, who can play a key role in the patient’s behavior change journey. FHIR-ed Up will take
advantage of key advancements in the secure transmission of data to further tailor behavior
change guidance and to create an interoperable and integrated experience that connects patients
and providers in the battle against tobacco.",  ,,,,SARA S JOHNSON,,(203) 208-0481,sjohnson@prochange.com,,  ,

The objective of this Phase II project is to improve outcomes and survival for patients with melanoma by
reducing the number of false negative sentinel lymph node biopsies wherein metastatic disease is missed
through conventional tissue processing and histological characterization. It is estimated that 4,200 patients are
misdiagnosed in this manner in the US per year which results in more conservative treatment regimens for
these patients than is required to effectively treat their disease. The outcome of patients not receiving the
proper treatment regimen is that they experience a three-year reduction in ten-year survival which on a quality
adjusted life year basis translates into a $1.2 billion economic loss. To address this problem, we have
developed a three-dimensional tissue imaging and digital analysis approach which allows for the complete
characterization of sentinel lymph node biopsy tissues and the identification of isolated tumor cells and micro-
metastases that are commonly missed with traditional histopathology. We have demonstrated through our
preliminary studies that using this approach we can identify these cancer cells in tissues that were previously
characterized as node negative and that we can differentiate true negative from false negative samples.
The focus of this project is to take this approach and transform it into a CLIA diagnostic assay that can be
offered as a laboratory developed test to patients with negative sentinel lymph node biopsies at the conclusion
of this Phase II work. Initially, the test will be offered following traditional tissue evaluation but eventually could
be used as a primary diagnostic approach for all melanoma sentinel lymph node biopsy tissues. The
development of this assay will be completed through conducting a retrospective clinical study in partnership
with Cedars-Sinai with archived negative sentinel lymph node biopsy tissue blocks where the approach will be
used to characterize these samples in their entirety. Through this study, we will demonstrate the accuracy,
specificity and sensitivity of the test and will be able to quantify the extent to which it reduces the incidence of
false negatives in the characterization of sentinel lymph node biopsies. Through the execution of this clinical
study, we will build a statistical model that will threshold samples based upon their underlying three-
dimensional features (e.g. total number of cancer cells, cancer cell aggregate volume, density of cancer cells)
and classify them as ‘no metastases present’ (i.e. true negative) or ‘metastases present’ (i.e. true positive).
Furthermore, the software we develop will for positive samples describe where a section should be taken from
the sample for confirmation by a Visikol pathologist using traditional histopathology such that the report from
the assay fits into the traditional classification paradigm. Lastly, we will transform our digital pathology software
analysis approach into a 21 CFR part 11 compliant application which will be required at the conclusion of the
project to start offering the assay as a CLIA test. To support this approach and to allow for the launch of a
laboratory developed test, we will also build the validation documentation package and associated tests
required to demonstrate the range, specificity, reproducibility, accuracy and precision of the assay. Therefore,
at the conclusion of this project we will have built and validated an assay which can start to be offered to
patients following the build-out of a CLIA lab and staffing with clinical personnel.",  ,,,,THOMAS S VILLANI,,(800) 615-8474,tom.villani@visikol.com,,  ,

million people in the United States. Even with optimal pharmacological treatment, motor function in
individuals with PD deteriorates progressively, leading to impaired mobility, difficulties with transfers,
posture, reaching, hand dexterity, and balance. Exercise therapy can slow down the degenerative process
of PD, improve motor function, gait, strength, balance, and quality-of-life. However, the current amount
of exercise therapy that individuals receive during in-clinic therapy sessions is inadequate. To maximize
the therapeutic benefit of exercise therapy, the overall dosage needs to be much higher than what is
typically provided during one-on-one in-clinic sessions. Devices that facilitate home exercise can thus
make it easier for individuals with PD to increase the amount of exercise therapy they receive. However,
to our knowledge, there is no commercially available exercise technology that is specifically tailored to
address the problems faced by individuals with PD. Flint Rehab has extensive experience designing safe
and motivating exercise technology for neurological disorders, having previously developed a wireless
movement sensing system called FitMi for individuals following a stroke. We believe that with the
appropriate, clinically-informed design improvements, FitMi could similarly facilitate a significant increase
in home exercise in individuals with PD. Thus, for this Phase I SBIR, we propose to build on the successful
FitMi design and create a new engaging home exercise program (“FitMi PD”) specifically for individuals
with PD. To maximize its benefit and target multiple areas of dysfunction, FitMi PD will incorporate a
variety of proven exercise modalities. The proposed FitMi PD system will also include an additional hip-
worn sensor, allowing us to expand the library of exercises FitMi can detect to include larger whole-body
movements. Our specific aims for Phase I are to: Aim 1) Perform structured interviews with clinical experts
and individuals with PD to optimize the design of FitMi PD (n=10). Aim 2) Develop FitMi PD exercise
software based on design requirements from Aim 1 andamp; iterative expert and user feedback and build
prototype hip-worn sensor. Aim 3) Perform a feasibility study of FitMi PD with 12 individuals with PD to
determine if it can safely promote unsupervised at-home exercise therapy. Our hypothesis is that FitMi
PD will be a feasible, motivating system for delivering effective exercise therapy at home, eventually
leading to significantly greater improvements in motor functions and activities of daily living in individuals
with PD. We will evaluate the efficacy of FitMi PD in Phase II. At the end of this project, we will have
completed initial development and feasibility testing of a novel home exercise device for individuals with
PD. We will refine and clinically validate FitMi PD in Phase II, leading to eventual commercialization of a
motivating, effective, and affordable at-home therapy option for individuals with PD.This research is relevant to public health because it will help support the development and
commercialization of a novel home exercise system for individuals with Parkinson’s Disease. FitMi PD will
help facilitate increased exercise therapy by guiding users through a variety of beneficial exercise
modalities in a fun and easy-to-use package. This will provide a pathway to slowing down the degenerative
process and possibly improving motor function, cognition, and quality of life for the 1 million individuals
in the United States diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease.",  ,,,,IAN M RUSSELL,,(339) 223-2676,irussell@flintrehab.com,,  ,

The 4-5N product purity would be sufficient for directional solidification or direct boule/wafer production, resulting in $2.20-2.70/kg solar-grade silicon cost, i.e., 75-80% lower than today. This purity through the novel process is achievable via electrochemical selection, an inert anode to avoid carbon anode contamination, and low impurity solubility in the solid silicon product. The technical issues/risks to be addressed in this proposal are salt trapping to practically produce dense and pure product, removing more electronegative impurities (P, Fe) that cause problems with carrier lifetimes, and utilizing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) stirring to overcome stagnant electrolyte bath.

Quantum computing will drive massive improvements in the world economy and the human condition in areas as diverse as drug discovery, novel materials, energy efficiency, and artificial intelligence. Industry analysts project rapid growth for the quantum computing/networking market: $5B in 2022, $24B in 2026, $270B in 2030. In terms of technological progress, this project will increase our knowledge of how to use the quantum properties of matter as a powerful new way to compute. In addition to commercial potential and scientific knowledge, the vision is that this work will also help catalyze a new generation of “quantum first” software developers, and this will be critical in maintaining our nation’s competitiveness in the 21st century. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project seeks to address a key challenge facing the current generation of quantum computers: execution quality. Each operation on a quantum computer incurs some error due to various types of noise that are present in and around these delicate systems. These errors accumulate, and this limits the size of program that can be successfully run. This in turn dramatically reduces the already limited set of problems that can be solved on a quantum computer. While noise characteristics of a quantum device are defined by the underlying hardware technology and device architecture, there are ways to improve execution quality through software by identifying or estimating errors and compensating for them. In fact, there is evidence from the literature that such improvements can improve fidelity of the execution by 10 times or more. In this project, a quantum compiler & circuit optimizer software product is developed that will incorporate known optimization methods, quantum error correction techniques, plus develop new approaches. The resulting software will match a quantum program with the quantum computer that will provide the best execution.

Significance: Atrial fibrosis plays a central role in the development of atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure,
which are both common conditions in the elderly and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This
proposal addresses an unmet diagnostic need for non-invasive methods to characterize atrial fibrosis through
non-invasive molecular imaging of type 1 collagen, the hallmark pathology of atrial fibrosis. Hypothesis: We
hypothesize that a collagen-binding gadolinium chelate will localize in fibrotic atrial tissue, thus enabling
targeted molecular imaging of atrial fibrosis to be performed with a high degree of accuracy. Preliminary data:
The affinity and specificity of Collagen Medical’s proprietary probe CM-101 for type 1 collagen are well
established. Our preliminary efficacy data have established that CM-101 can quantify fibrosis burden in a rat
bile duct ligation model (BDL) of chronic liver disease. Additionally, CM-101 enhanced differences in T1 and
signal intensity in a canine myocardial infarct model were shown to be related to the fibrosis burden in the left
ventricle. Here, for the first time, we propose to use the agent to image left atrial fibrosis using a porcine model
of atrial fibrillation. Specific Aims: In Phase 1, Specific Aim 1, of this Fast Track proposal we aim to establish
that CM-101 specifically accumulates in regions of atrial fibrosis as compared with a non-targeted control and
that it can be imaged in vivo with T1 weighted sequences. A porcine model of focal left atrial fibrosis created
using radiofrequency ablation catheters will be used. The gating decision criteria for a transition to Phase 2 are
based on quantitative assessment of tissue specificity vs. non-targeted control and in vivo imaging. In Phase
2, Specific Aim 2 of the grant, we will demonstrate the ability of CM-101 enhanced MRI to quantify patchy and
diffuse left atrial fibrosis in a porcine model of atrial fibrillation and will compare the collagen targeted agent to
the current gold standard, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) using the non-targeted agent (Gd-DOTA).
Overall Impact: We anticipate that the targeted and specific nature of CM-101 will produce significantly more
accurate data than LGE using non-targeted chelates, the current gold standard. Together, data obtained in
these studies will support an IND application and accelerate translation into the clinical realm.",  ,,,,VALERIE  HUMBLET,,(617) 642-0585,vhumblet@cmed.cc,,  ,

As rates of adolescent depression and suicidality continue to trend upwards, the healthcare system struggles
to address the need for and lack of mental health service use. The pediatric patient-centered medical home
model may improve adolescent depression outcomes by enhancing access to and coordinating care, as well
as providing ongoing monitoring. Unfortunately, despite guideline recommendations, over 2/3 of adolescents
identified with depression symptoms in primary care do not receive symptom monitoring and 19% do not receive symptom reassessment. This lack of symptom monitoring and reassessment can result in untoward
health outcomes including a decrease in functioning, increased use of acute and crisis services, and hospitalizations due to suicidality. Current technologies which incorporate data passively collected from smartphones
offer an opportunity for intercurrent monitoring between patient visits which limits burden on the patient to self-report and limits burden on the healthcare system, allowing primary care teams to triage contacting and assessing patients a system identifies with an increase in disease severity. This formative study will demonstrate
the usability and potential clinical utility of MoodRing, a technology intervention which will collect passive mobile phone sensor data on aspects of adolescent phone use related to depressive symptom severity (e.g. communication patterns, social media use, travel) and integrate this data into a multi-user (adolescent, parent, primary care provider/care manager) platform from which symptoms can be viewed and secure communication
can occur. MoodRing, as supported by Health Belief Model, may lead to improved quality of depression management (increased symptom reassessment, therapy/medication adherence) through increasing self-efficacy,
social support from parent and care team, as well as encouraging application of self-management skills
through increased self-management knowledge, skills, and symptom feedback. MoodRing builds on a solid
foundation of investigators experienced in design of technology interventions to increase adolescent initiation
of depression treatment, who have already developed machine algorithms for passive sensing and a small
business partner with vast experience in working with health researchers to develop multi-user web/mobile
platforms. This STTR Phase I study seeks to accomplish two aims. The first is to apply a machine learning
pipeline developed for college-aged youth to adolescents with depression and determine whether self-reported
depressive symptoms can be reliably predicted from passive data with at least 85% accuracy. The second is
the user design and system architecture of MoodRing. If milestones are achieved that models are successful at
predicting depressive symptoms and the proposed MoodRing intervention is acceptable to adolescents, parents, and primary care providers/care managers, then we will pursue the STTR Phase II study. The aims of
Phase II include the development and subsequent efficacy trial of MoodRing. Specifically, we will conduct a
cluster randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting of MoodRing as compared to usual care.",  ,,,,SAMI  SHAABAN,,(724) 430-0490,sam@nurelm.com,,  ,

A balloon mission could closely study the chemical composition of trace compounds in the upper atmosphere and resolve ongoing scientific debate regarding the presence of specific gases having biological origins on Earth. The moderate Earth-like pressures and temperatures at such high altitudes on Venus allow for long-term operation of scientific equipment, unlike the very the high surface temperature and pressure which severely limit survivability of exploration vehicles. Prior lander missions to Venus survived just over two hours on the surface before overheating, while high-altitude balloons have operated for days (limited by battery capacity). Future balloon-based missions could far exceed previous mission durations, but balloons have an inherently limited lifetime due to loss of lift. Balloon platforms also have limited altitude operating range and do not penetrate the lower atmosphere. To address these balloon system limitations, Creare proposes the Venus Sonde, a drone-based ballast sonde with a mass of 5 to 10 kg capable of flying multiple missions and returning to the balloon prior to a final one-way flight to the surface. During the initial high-altitude flights, the Venus Sonde launches from the balloon platform under fixed-wing flight to profile the atmosphere in the vicinity of the balloon up to 70 km in altitude and then returns to land on the platform under vertical flight. The final flight occurs when needed to reduce the ballast weight of the system, thereby increasing net lift.

Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) is a debilitating condition causing a wide range of disabilities
including behavioral and intellectual deficits, facial dysmorphology, and organ malformations. This disorder has
a profound impact on health care burden and cost; as many as 5% of children within the United States are
affected by this condition, with lifetime treatment costs reaching $2 million per individual. Despite the severity
of this disorder and its impact on public health, there currently are no therapeutic treatments available for
FASD. As such, identifying therapeutic molecules that can alleviate neurobehavioral issues associated with
FASD is critical. Our long-term objective is to identify effective treatments to ameliorate the cognitive
impairments associated with FASD. We have recently discovered that the targeting of the KCNN2 potassium
channel using a short peptide, Tamapin, improves both the gross and fine motor learning skills in our mouse
model of FASD. These findings suggest that KCNN2 blockers have the potential to reverse the
neurobehavioral problems associated with FASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. We have already
prescreened 6 peptide candidates from the 589 designs of Tamapin variants using in silico screening, and
have custom-synthesized them. The goal of this STTR Phase I study is to select the lead drug candidate(s)
that demonstrate the best performance in safely improving behavioral deficits in the mouse model of FASD.
from the current 6 candidates. We will focus on in vitro screening of candidates through viability/cytotoxicity
assays and in vitro electrophysiology analysis (Aim 1), and defining the in vivo efficacy of the lead peptides to
improve neurobehavioral deficits in a mouse model of FASD (Aim 2). This research has immense potential in
addressing the major public health issue of neurological deficits associated with FASD through identifying
novel therapeutic peptides that may alleviate these symptoms.Project Narrative
Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) results in severe behavioral, intellectual, and developmental deficits;
however, pharmacological treatments for alleviating FASD currently do not exist. We propose to directly treat
the neurobehavioral deficits associated with FASD by developing custom peptides through computational
modeling and validation via neurophysiological and behavioral testing. This work may provide critical solutions
in addressing neurological disabilities associated with FASD.",  ,,,,MASAAKI  TORII,,(202) 476-4279,mtorii@childrensnational.org,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,  ,

This asset-specific information is needed as weather, especially extreme weather events, continue to affect various industries and a wide range of individual assets. Accurate forecasting can improve logistics, supply-chain, labor scheduling and affect seed selection of a variety of crops important in the US economy, including stone-fruits, apples and pears. In addition, the technical innovation has the potential to improve local estimates of environmental variables relevant to the agricultural, energy and insurance industries.

Many bacteria kill their host by forming biofilms on the plant surface. Central to this proposal are findings that biofilms confer tolerance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents, whether these antimicrobial agents are antibiotics, disinfectants, or germicides. Dispersing these biofilms is necessary to remove contaminating bacteria from the plant surface. This proposal is addressing these challenges by developing safe and natural biofilm degrading enzymes from the collection of over 3,000 unique microorganisms called Dictyostelids isolated from five continents and several island nations. The focus of this proof-of-principle project is discovery of enzymes for treatment of bacterial potato soft rot. This disease is socially and commercially impacting our nation as potatoes are the most consumed vegetable in the U.S. with a total market value exceeding $3.5 B. The proposed project advances the use of Dictyostelid strains capable of dispersing biofilms formed by Dickeya and Pectobacterium and feeding on planktonic bacteria liberated from the corresponding bacterial biofilms.

For years, farmers growing organic, non-genetically modified (non-GM) and specialty crops have incurred crop damage and financial losses due to drift of volatile herbicides, such as dicamba. The EPA estimates that up to 70 million pounds of pesticides, including herbicides, are lost to the environment due to drift each year. In 2017 alone, 3.6 million acres of soybeans were destroyed due to dicamba drifting away from its site of application. This project addresses the problem with a novel technology that reduces herbicide volatility and drift. This technology will help farmers growing GM-crops who face litigation because they spray drifting dicamba, and those who grow non-GM-crops and do not want drifted dicamba to impact their produce. Agrochemical companies currently facing EPA restrictions, product bans, and billions of dollars in lawsuits, can use this technology to improve the application efficiency of their products.

More than 1 million surgeries to repair torn ligaments and tendons are performed in the United States annually. However, the failure rates are reported to be as high as 25% and the majority of failures are attributed to a technical error, which costs the US healthcare system $2.5 billion each year. Stitching has been identified as a critical, technically complex step in the surgery that, if improved, can be a way to reduce the incidence of failure. Current stitching needles have serious limitations that make stitching slow, tedious, and inaccurate. The two-part needle technology proposed in this project fundamentally changes how stitching can be performed. Better quality and faster stitching provides a societal benefit of improved patient outcomes as well as commercial benefits of avoided costs associated with failed surgeries and savings from reduced procedure times. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project supports development of a revolutionary suturing device that will advance stitching capabilities for orthopedic ligament and tendon repair surgery. The groundbreaking two-part needle design offers a value proposition of improved speed and quality of stitching, two essential elements for clinical success. This project has two overarching technical objectives: First, prototypes will be constructed with variable characteristics, and force testing will be performed to determine how each characteristic impacts functionality of the device. Performance of the device with regards to forces experienced during stitching will be compared to conventional needles. Second, prototypes will be constructed and tested by potential customers to assess usability for the intended purpose of creating specific stitch patterns. Speed of stitching and biomechanical strength of the stitch patterns will be compared to patterns created with conventional needles to quantify the value proposition. Successful completion of the objectives will substantially advance the two-part needle technology toward commercialization in orthopedics and provide a basis for additional research of the two-part needle design for other surgical applications that rely on stitching.

Although potent antithrombotic drugs are available, all inadvertently target vital hemostatic mechanisms,
resulting in dose-limiting hemorrhagic toxicity that restricts their use. Due to a lack of safe thromboprophylaxis,
thrombotic/thromboembolic blood vessel occlusions and vascular device failures remain among the leading
causes of death and severe chronic disability in the U.S. Consequently, there is a significant and urgent unmet
medical need for safe antithrombotic drugs. The safety problem with current antithrombotics is particularly
complicated in end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on chronic hemodialysis, who are prone to both
bleeding and thromboembolic complications. Moreover, some ESRD patients develop acute heparin induced
thrombocytopenia (HIT), another potentially life-threatening complication of heparin use in a small but
significant fraction of ESRD patients, leaving them with few if any off-label options for temporal anticoagulation
during hemodialysis sessions. We are therefore continuing clinical development of our first-in-class, FDA Fast
Track designated antithrombotic enzyme, AB002 (E-WE thrombin), by evaluating its safety and antithrombotic
activity during hemodialysis. The product candidate is a hemostatically safe antithrombotic protein C activator
enzyme that has the potential to help this desperately ill patient population. AB002 has been designed to act in
part by increasing the surface concentration of the anticoagulant, profibrinolytic, and cytoprotective enzyme,
endogenous activated protein C (APC), at the site of developing blood clots via targeted cellular delivery. This
unique mechanism of action allows AB002 to target cell-rich pathological blood clots (thrombi) without disabling
vital hemostasis. In primates, bolus doses as low as 1 µg/kg are antithrombotic without significant systemic
anticoagulation or measurable antihemostatic effects. This critical Phase IIB Bridge Award grant will allow us to
continue product development by providing essential support for an FDA-mandated repeat dose toxicity study
and initiation of a phase 2 human clinical trial in hemodialysis patients where subjects will be repeatedly
exposed to AB002. The results from this study will be used to determine if repeated exposure to AB002 has
toxicity or elicits immunogenic responses. The animal toxicity study will be successful if there are no
observable drug toxicities. The clinical trial will be deemed successful and support further studies in this and
other indications if AB002 is not associated with clinically significant drug-related adverse events, while
showing evidence of antithrombotic and/or anti-inflammatory activity. Successfully achieving our SBIR
milestones will lead directly into the next product development stage: performing subsequent definitive trials in
hemodialysis and other clinically important thrombotic diseases (e.g. ischemic stroke, pulmonary embolism,
and acute myocardial infarction) for the benefit of patients who desperately need safer antithrombotic and
thrombolytic therapies.",  ,,,,ERIK I TUCKER,,(503) 522-3083,erik.tucker@aronorabio.com,,  ,

less. CAR-T therapies have recently been approved for use in B-cell malignancies and have
provided a starting point for cell therapies to gain a foothold as standard of care. However,
translation of that success into solid tumors has been slow, almost non-existent. The major
underlying cause for this appears to be lack of persistence of the therapeutic cell whereby it
succumbs to the toxic milieu produced by the tumor. Ares Immunotherapy has isolated a unique
T cell subset that can overcome this issue by means of anti-apoptotic mechanisms and at a limited
ability to self-renew. These, in combination with an elevated homing and migration capacity, the
ability to secrete both Th1 and Th17 cytokines, and direct cytotoxicity via Granzyme B and
CD107A create a cell that has the potential to eradicate even large entrenched tumor masses. In
preclinical studies the Ares cells, when generated as a mesothelin specific CAR-T, have
been able to ablate tumors in a mesothelioma mouse model and greatly reduce tumor
burden in a pancreatic model.Our proposed research plan will A) improve manufacturing robustness; B) determine the
optimal cell to be used based on a combination of clinical efficacy and a robust, scalable process;

Despite their widespread adoption in surgical practices, stapler malfunctioning or misuse can cause severe surgical and post-surgical complications which include bleeding, sepsis, and death. Misfiring and cutting errors are the main causes of staplers malfunctioning. This project proposes a semi-reusable surgical stapler which will provide real-time feedback to surgeons to guide the firing, thus reducing staplers malfunctioning and increasing surgeries success rates. The proposed solution combines a reusable control system, which will decrease the amount of toxic waste generated by the healthcare system (adding up to landfill and accounting for 25% of healthcare expenditures), and a disposable handle, which will allow to cut down the cost and time required for surgery preparation (40% savings/procedure). The proposed solution will save hospital costs and improve surgeries performances, decreasing the risks of complications during surgeries. Additionally, this project will bring forward research in the field of smart devices in medical industry, potentially leading to innovation for other types of surgical devices. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop the control system to automate the tissue recognition of the firing system of the proposed surgical stapler. The stapler working parameters must be carefully selected in accordance with the tissue’s biomechanical properties. Tissues' intrinsic characteristics vary among organs and individuals, complicating the standardization of firing parameters. The proposed system will assist surgeons by providing real-time information over the tissue to clamp and advising over the optimal cartridge to be used. This project will feature the design of the control system capable of sensing the tissue in the clamp and deciding optimal staple firing parameters. First, the components of the control system will be designed. Successively, the algorithm to control firing speed, energy consumption, and articulation will be developed on an empirical dataset. The project will establish the correlation between clamping forces and tissue parameters. The benefits yielded by the developed surgical stapler, will be benchmarked against commercial solutions both in vitro and ex vivo.

Reproductive genetic tests are a disparate collection of methodologies with identify specific classes of mutations
known to interfere with gametogenesis, conception and fetal viability. The number and variety of tests addressing
this clinical need reflect the scale of genetic lesions that are relevant to reproductive medicine, ranging from
whole chromosome aneuploidy to single nucleotide variants. In this proposal, we describe a highly scalable
reproductive genetic test that can deliver results that span this scale at high resolution, lower cost, and faster
turnaround time than current tests.
Our approach uses a proximity ligation DNA sequencing method called Hi-C, which captures ultra-long-range
genomic contiguity information using ubiquitious short-read sequencing and benchtop molecular biology. We
have demonstrated extensively that Hi-C data can be used to order and orient genome assemblies,
reconstructing end-to-end chromosome sequences. This method also identifies structural genomic
rearrangements including balanced translocations, inversions, and other aberrations not detectable by typical
sequencing approaches.
We propose to apply high-throughput proximity ligation as a cytogenomic method to detect the breadth of
chromosomal aberrations at high resolution and low cost. This proposal outlines a path to a commercially
available product and service, which will establish a highly validated method for use in research and eventually
in a diagnostic setting. This will be accomplished by 1) designing an easy to use Hi-C protocol amenable to
multiwell plate handling, 2) building a robust computational platform to reproducibly call chromosome aberrations
from Hi-C data, and 3) proving the validity and reproducibility of these methods on real world samples. The
resulting kit and software product will be a new cytogenomic method called Karyotyping by SequencingTM (KBS)
that we will deploy as a Precision Medicine test for the reproductive testing market.",  ,,,,STEPHEN M EACKER,,(410) 382-8041,seacker1@jhmi.edu,,  ,

Agricultural land productivity has increased approximately 3-fold in the past 60 years, due to a combination of crop breeding and genetic engineering, adoption of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and irrigation. By expanding understanding of plant developmental biology, the technology developed via this project will increase productivity by 300-fold over current practices via high density cultivation of only the edible fruits of plants, not the supporting roots, leaves, or stems. The innovation will enable indoor fruit production independent of local climate and growing seasons. Controlled environment fruit crop cultivation will alleviate food insecurity and food deserts, creating a decentralized, resilient global food production system, even in industrial areas or non-arable land. Concurrently, land formerly used for conventional agriculture can be restored to natural ecosystems, and water supplies will no longer be subjected to contamination by agrichemicals. Additionally, controlled environment fruit crop cultivation will combat climate change by making soil management unnecessary, which could decrease annual greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by 5%, or 325 M metric tons CO2 equivalent. This project represents an expansion beyond traditional agriculture: that a seed or cutting must be grown to regenerate a full plant, from which products and seeds or cuttings can then be harvested, repeating indefinitely. The proposed project will advance the frontier of understanding of flower and fruit development in sweet cherry, and example of a fruit tree species that normally requires years of growth in an orchard setting before sufficient flowering occurs and fruit can be harvested. The anticipated results will prove the feasibility of flower formation in the absence of other plant structures, demonstrating the application of plant biotechnology to adapt fruit tree species to controlled environment agriculture. The goals of the project are to generate totipotent plant cells and induce early flowering from those cells with minimal to no vegetative growth. By combining plant biotechnology techniques, tissue culture media testing and controlled abiotic factors such as light and temperature to recreate the appropriate environment in vitro, plant cells will be directed to form flowers and bypass growth of vegetative structures such as leaves and branches. This project will demonstrate the potential of indoor cultivation of sweet cherry, leading to scaled production of proprietary cherry cultivars, plant growth media, and novel controlled environment agriculture methods.

population. In the median age group of 50-79 years alone, more than 25 million adults are seeking treatment for
RLS, making it the second most common sleep disorder in the world. The severe leg sensations of RLS are most
prevalent at night, thus leading to sleep deprivation and its downstream consequences of depressed mood,
irritability, forgetfulness, difficulty learning, and lack of motivation. Voluntary leg movements lead to reduction in
these symptoms; however, such movements are incompatible with sleep. Drug-based RLS therapies are met
with mixed results, becoming progressively less effective over time, and in many cases having debilitating side-
effects. For this reason, a significant portion of RLS patients move to off-label medications, including opiates and
benzodiazepines. There exists a large unmet need for an effective non-drug RLS therapy. The Noctrix Health
wearable Peripheral Nerve Stimulation System (NPNS) is designed to mimic the therapeutic benefits of voluntary
leg movements without the distracting side-effects. Initial open-label studies of acute therapeutic response show
that NPNS reduces RLS symptom severity by 83% in moderate to severe RLS patients. Device development
work is required to translate the NPNS technology into a compact, wearable device that can be reliably self-
administered by patients in the home for daily overnight use. Clinical validation is required to determine
preliminary therapeutic response in key patient sub-populations. This SBIR Fast Track proposal will facilitate
the translation of this promising technology into a wearable, simple-to-use device and evaluate tolerability,

validate form factor most compatible for daily overnight use. Design a wearable device that can deliver the
programmed therapy waveform uninterrupted for the requisite duration with a form factor that is minimally
disruptive to sleep from existing company-sourced patient and physician feedback. Aim 2: Integrate
compliance tracking and activity monitoring. Design and integrate 3D motion smart sensing and event
logging into the device. Phase 2 Aim 1: Establish tolerability, compliance, safety, and identify clinical sub-
population therapeutic response. Conduct a clinical trial with 20 patients in each of 3 cohorts (drug-naïve,
drug-refractory, and clinician-guided opiate-reduction) to study tolerability, safety, compliance, and size of
treatment effect. Aim 2: Develop algorithm for detection of RLS-related leg movements. Using the data
provided by on-board sensors (developed in Phase 1 and collected in Phase II Aim 1), develop an algorithm for
detection of RLS-related leg movements during sleep. The algorithm will report an objective state marker of
symptom severity and will ultimately be used to apply pulses to maintain sleep, when necessary. Successful

Current technologies for responding to large wildfires do not typically achieve direct extinguishment and are rather aimed at the gradual guidance and containment of fires - in the era of regular megafires (greater than 100,000 acres), methods such as aerial drops are rarely effective despite their enormous expense. As populations have further expanded into the urban-wildland interface, environmental change has produced extended droughts and weakened forests, and fuel loads have accumulated for far longer than would be natural, fire seasons now approach perennial levels. As a result, Federal annual spending on emergency suppression now regularly reaches $2B to $3B, up from an average of less than $1B at the end of the 20th century, and the holistic economic impact of a bad fire season may cost the broader economy an order of magnitude more in lost Gross Domestic Product. The proposed project implements a cost-effective, rapid-response shock wave technology to extinguish large fire fronts. This project involves technical innovation in the novel application of controlled, directed shock waves to uncontrolled wildfire-scale flames fueled by organic material, with the goal of achieving rapid extinguishment. Characterization of turbulent flame and debris field response to a multitude of variables which are important for field deployment will result from testing with a physical prototype device – this device features novel mechanisms for the safe, repeated delivery of tunable shock waves.

There are 380,000 infants born preterm each year in the United States alone. Preterm infants often necessitate
care in the neonatal intensive care unit. One of the final milestones to be achieved in order to be discharged
from the neonatal intensive care unit is oral feeding. Oral feeding can be a challenge for infants born preterm
as they do not have the maturity that allows for coordinated sucking, swallowing, and breathing. Many infants
will suck and swallow, and their failure to breathe will result in dangerous physiological fluctuations. To help
with this, pacing techniques can be used. Cautious caregivers can intermittently pull the bottle nipple out of the
infant’s mouth to encourage breathing and recovery. This can be disruptive to the feeding process, can result
in significant energy expenditure, and can be stressful for parents. To address this problem, the Preemie-Pacer
bottle is in development. The Preemie-Pacer has an internal mechanism that interrupts the flow of milk to the
nipple intermittently to enable the infant to pause and breathe.
The long-term goal of this project is to develop an innovative bottle that will address the problems that preterm
infants experience during early oral feeding, allowing early feeds to occur safely and efficiently. The current
project aims are to 1) optimize the design of the Preemie-Pacer bottle with the addition of an ‘assessment
mode’ and internal memory unit, external display, and rechargeable base followed by doing laboratory testing,
and 2) improve usability by defining programming for individualized use of the Preemie-Pacer. To achieve this,
design work will be followed by laboratory testing of the device to ensure its durability, repeatability and
reliability. Then 100 preterm infants born ≤32 weeks gestation will be fed two times each week by a neonatal
therapist who will control the flow of milk using a sensor on the bottle, according to the infant’s behavioral
signs. Data will be downloaded and pooled and algorithms fit to the data to establish appropriate timing of flow
and run across different ages and other infant factors. These evidence-based rates will be incorporated into the
bottle programming and will play based on unique infant factors that the feeder enters on the Preemie-Pacer,
with the ability to adjust the rates if needed. This work will set the stage for clinical trials on safety and efficacy.
The Preemie-Pacer can have a significant impact on the care that preterm infants receive. If safe and efficient
oral feeding can be achieved even a few days earlier, significant health care dollars can be saved, and infants
can be discharged to their homes earlier. In addition, parents can potentially have more success and

Timely and accurate diagnosis of BSI would decrease the incidence of sepsis, as well as unnecessary or inappropriate antibiotic administration that can contribute to pathogen mutation and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The risk of unnecessary or under-prescribed antibiotics during the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified future AMR threats, especially given that the incidence of bacterial sepsis occurs in 1 out of 7 COVID-19 inpatients, with a 50% mortality rate. Thus, a rapid, reliable in vitro diagnostic test for BSI would improve patient outcomes and have a measurable impact on quality of care, infection control, and overall healthcare management. The proposed technology for blood stream infection (BSI) detection and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) is rapid, highly sensitivity, and requires a low specimen volume. The assay would provide advantages over current standards of care (blood culture; BC), which typically require 24 to 72-hours to confirm the presence of a BSI. Additionally, this novel BSI assay does not require complex amplification steps (polymerase chain reaction; PCR) to detect pathogens. Given sepsis mortality rates increase by 7.6% per hour without appropriate antibiotic administration, septic patient care and survival demands early screening innovations that quickly and easily type species and determine AST to guide responsible antibiotic administration. The delayed results associated with current BSI testing methods hinders effective antibiotic selection, accuracy and timing. The proposed technology is comprised of a patent-pending bloodborne pathogen enrichment innovation that combines functionalized magnetic beads and the unique Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) substrate. The assay is built on three principles: (1) LAL contains highly sensitive proteins capable of detecting cell wall markers on gram-negative bacteria and fungi; (2) Differential LAL blocking would distinguish fungal and bacterial infection; and (3) Inclusion of a silkworm larvae plasma would provide a colorimetric output that detects gram-positive bacteria.

The resulting end-to-end solution will enable private and public project developers, as well as utilities to quickly commission and cost effectively operate DER systems composed of solar arrays, batteries, generators, fuel cells and many other kinds of energy assets in residential, commercial, and industrial sites with complete confidence on the reliability, seamless grid integration, and economic performance of the systems. By making it that much easier and cheaper to own, integrate, and operate clean energy equipment, the resulting solution will transform the energy industry from the ground up, using DERs as the pillars of a new clean, resilient, and equitable grid.

Reliable detection of these diseases at an early stage has the potential for significantly improving disease outcomes, by reducing the health impact of lung diseases and the costs associated with the treatment. Briefly, 14 million Americans are currently estimated to have Pulmonary Function Test (PFT)-diagnosed COPD, while >16 million subjects are expected to have PFT-undiagnosed COPD leading to the first or initial diagnosis at the severe stages. Currently no accurate and early lung health assessments exist, representing a vital healthcare gap - especially for young children, elderly and subjects with chronic conditions, as lung diagnostics such as PFT require patient compliance and CT, PET etc., have significant risk for these subjects. With >16 million cases of PFT-undiagnosed COPD in the United States alone, a new lung health screening diagnostic test will address the “invisible” epidemic of COPD and help monitor impact of exposure to first- and secondhand- smoke, e-cig vapors and air pollutants. Early more frequent lung health screening will allow timely intervention and limit significant health care costs. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will accelerate development and commercialization of a lung health multiplex point of care test (xPOCT) for early diagnosis and intervention of COPD. The POCT is supported by proof-of-concept pre-clinical data and human subject validation of a prognostic biomarker for delivering on first-in-class RAPID home-based and POC Lung Health Diagnostics (LHDx) for predicting initiation and progression of COPD-emphysema. The goal is to develop an effective, non-invasive and rapid LHDx for early more frequent screening and diagnosis of COPD-emphysema, commonly missed by current standard-of-care diagnostics. This project has the following objectives: (1) prototype engineering and standardization of the specificity and sensitivity of the home-based and POC LHDx platform technology; (2) validation of the diagnostic assay specificity and sensitivity for evaluating disease prognosis; and (3) development of a lab validation assay with custom software for disease severity analysis and initiate regulatory approval for commercialization of the home-based RAPID and POC LHDx. The Phase I project will address the unmet need for identification of individuals that are at-risk and highly susceptible to developing COPD for prognosis-based early intervention.

Scientists have worked for decades to develop an affordable non-surgical sterilization solution. However, efforts to date have been unsuccessful, and surgical spaying remains as the sole option available for sterilizing female animals. At present, sterilization is an invasive surgical procedure that requires the removal of a healthy animal’s reproductive organs at great risk and physical cost to the dog, financial and emotional cost to the owner, time cost to the veterinarian, and significant financial cost to shelters. Because the high cost and the risk of developing surgery-related infection or death makes surgical spays unmanageable, shelters are forced to euthanize millions of dogs each year due to overpopulation. By making spays non-surgical, inexpensive, and quick, more female dogs will be sterilized before reaching puberty, relieving the strain of overpopulation and dramatically reducing surgical morbidity and mortality. The proposed project seeks to replace surgical sterilization for female dogs with a single injection sterilant designed to induce permanent sterility and tested in rats. This project will determine whether reproductive inhibition observed in rodent species will be translatable to the dog. Specifically, the goal is to identify effective and safe dosage range and temporal window. The animals will be carefully followed for health and safety assessments and female reproductive outcomes will be measured. If successful, this project will indicate that sterilization can be achieved in female dogs without resorting to invasive physical surgery. A pilot study will also be performed in male dogs to determine an optimal dose that will inhibit developmental maturation of the testis and thus inhibit fertility at puberty.

It starts silently in the brain decades
before memory loss begins. An estimated 46 million Americans are affected by the first pre-symptomatic phase
of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This stage represents a window of opportunity to address risk factors which can
delay progression to dementia. Unfortunately, the majority of this population is unaware that lifestyle changes
can significantly delay cognitive decline. In addition, few have access to physicians specializing in AD risk
reduction and most people with AD live in low-income communities with limited healthcare access.Several randomized trials have found that multi-domain interventions can maintain cognition. A trial led
by two members of our study team showed that individualized lifestyle interventions can significantly reduce
AD risk and improve cognition. To build on this work, RETAIN Health, Inc developed a cross platform “mobile-
first” application for AD risk reduction. RETAIN is a digital therapeutic designed to assess the risk of an
individual and apply behavioral modification techniques to deliver evidence-based, personalized
recommendations. Our system promotes behavior change in the areas of diet, physical exercise, sleep, social
engagement, cognitive engagement, vascular risk factors (e.g., blood pressure), obesity, smoking cessation,
and stress management. RETAIN uses bi-directional SMS text messaging to create a virtual conversation. As
96% of Americans own cell phones, automated text communication can cost-effectively serve people who lack
access to care on a large scale. Importantly, RETAIN builds off 7 years of our prior research using web-based
education in collaboration with academia, establishing a substantive foundation.We aim to improve the user experience of our software through both qualitative and quantitative user
experience testing. We will then evaluate whether RETAIN is effective in reducing AD risk using a validated
risk index. We will also explore effectiveness in improving cognition and quality of life. We will then assess the
associated costs to the user of the risk reduction interventions and evaluate user satisfaction. We will conduct
a six-month, web-based, three-arm randomized controlled trial of 860 subjects at risk for AD. As was
accomplished in our prior studies, we will use targeted internet advertising to rapidly and cost-effectively recruit
a diverse cohort. Arm 1 will include personalized, web-based AD risk factor education plus regular
personalized bi-directional SMS text communication. Arm 2 will include personalized web-based AD risk factor
education without personalized SMS text. Arm 3 (control) will include generalized AD education covering
statistics, public policy, and caregiving, along with regular SMS text communication about these topics.Successful implementation of this project will result in the first automated digital solution to provide
multi-domain individualized management for people at risk for AD. It will also result in a product ready for

enable folding of cytokines in E. coli and facile purification of the tag-free, native protein. Selection is
based on the discovery that unfolded proteins restrict growth of the E. coli host cell when co-expressed
with an engineered restriction protease. A tag that facilitates the folding of an otherwise poorly-folded
protein rescues growth. Using the selection method, we will develop tags enabling purification of key
cytokines needed to create defined, synthetic cell culture media. Our approach employs random
mutagenesis of a tandem tag of Protein G domains (GA-GB) and selection using a restriction protease
system that we will develop. We will evolve folding tags for four targets and expand the envelop of
recombinant proteins that can be purified in E coli. Specific Aims are: Construct plasmids for co-
expression of GA-GB-target proteins with the restriction protease; Construct random libraries of GA-GB-
target protein; Select for escape mutants; Analyze of mutations that allow escape; Purify proteins using
newly-evolved tags; Test physical and biological properties of purified proteins. Feasibility will be
determined by whether we can evolve effective folding tags for all four targets. An effective folding tag is
defined as one that allows purification of ≥50mg of native, biologically-active cytokine per L of culture. At
the end of Phase I we will have developed methods for identifying effective folding tags for two major
structural classes of cytokines. We will also have learned whether evolved folding tags for a structural
class of cytokine are similar. This knowledge will simplify identification of folding tags for new cytokine
targets as well as other high-value proteins. In Phase II we would evolve tags for 17 major cytokines
used in cell culture.Project Narrative: Numerous cytokines are needed for cell culture but most are difficult
and costly to purify. We will develop a powerful selection method to identify cytokine-
specific folding tags for recombinant hosts. Folding tags will facilitate purification of the
key cytokines needed to create defined, synthetic cell culture media and aid in the
production of therapeutic cells.",  ,,,,PHILIP N BRYAN,,(240) 252-9748,pbryan@umd.edu,,  ,

language and reading disorders to support early reading instruction. In the absence of adequate screening,
disorders are under-diagnosed and detected too late, resulting in adverse academic outcomes. While research
shows that digital tools can successfully screen for language disorders such as SLI (Grammaggio), and
reading disorders such as dyslexia (Amira Reading Screener), currently no practical, cost-effective and reliable
screening method exists which integrates information about a childandapos;s language and reading skills.
Our goal is to create a reliable andamp; valid digital screening process amenable to implementation by schools. The
goal is to identify at-risk children by combining the predictive role of language impairments (expressed via
grammar) with a fully-automated early reading assessment (expressed via reading aloud). By directly
comparing the results of both screeners, the research aims to establish the parameters for a unified screener
able to operate within the critical constraints of usefulness, namely: modest test time to avoid lost instructional
time; an extremely low false positive rate; minimal requirements for teacher training, and; easy access from
both the classroom and home. One asset is a sample of children participating in an ongoing longitudinal study
with well-documented diagnosis of SLI and reading disorders in addition to extensive experience with
Grammaggio. The second asset is a well-documented innovative technology for teaching reading to children
(Amira) coupled to a proven reading screener (Amira Reading Screener). Aim 1 is to determine if the
combination of a language screener and a reading screener yields increased accuracy for identification of
children with reading disorders. Aim 2 is to identify possible correspondences of reading errors identified by
Amira with grammatical errors evaluated by Grammaggio. Four groups of children will be recruited from an
existing longitudinal sample: SLI, reading disordered, both SLI and reading disorders, and control children.
Screening outcomes will be validated against an external gold standard, the existing measurement protocol in
R01DC001803 that provides standardized language and reading assessments of participating children.
Successful completion of the aims will determine whether a combined electronic screener can reliably, validly,
and cost-effectively flag students at-risk for specific disorders. Our prediction is that we will improve our
understanding of the overlaps and interactions between reading and language disorders, leading to earlier and
more effective treatments of these disorders. The team proposing this work benefits from the field expertise of
Riceandapos;s team in ongoing data assessments and includes key personnel from Amira Learning. The combination
of assets and expertise is well-positioned to make significant progress. Preliminary data collection in advance
of this submission suggests that our integrated prototype screener will improve identification of children at-risk

formed in the diagnosis and monitoring of glaucoma. This proposal aims at developing the hardware system
that will allow acquisition of fundus photographs using the nGoggle, a portable Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)
which integrates a wearable, wireless, electroencephalogram (EEG) system and a head-mounted display to
monitor electrical brain activities associated with visual field stimulation. In a previous project, we developed the
nGoggle portable system for the assessment of visual function deficits in order to address limitations of standard
automated perimetry (SAP), a traditional but subjective visual field test. We compared the diagnostic accuracies
of the nGoggle and SAP in discriminating patients with glaucoma from healthy subjects and found that the BCI
performed at least as well, if not better than SAP, with the additional advantage of portability and objectivity.With rapid advancements in smartphone cameras, it is now possible to develop compact auto-focusing
fundus cameras and integrate them into our neuro-monitoring nGoggle. Recently we developed an approach
named Machine-to-Machine (M2M), a deep learning algorithm that was trained to analyze fundus photos and
predict quantitative measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and neuroretinal rim provided by spectral
domain-optical coherence tomography (SDOCT), with high correlation and agreement with the original SDOCT
observations. This approach opens up the possibility of using simple fundus photographs to extract quantitative
information about neural damage in glaucoma. By combining functional assessment currently provided by the
nGoggle with structural assessment capability, this new system would result in a very unique device capable of
portable structural and functional assessment of optic nerve damage for a multitude of eye conditions, not limited
to glaucoma, such as age-related macular degeneration, retinal degenerations and non-glaucomatous optic neu-
ropathies.The specific aims of this Phase I SBIR project are (1) to incorporate a high-resolution auto-focusing
fundus camera to the nGoggle head-mounted display in full compliance with ophthalmic instrument safety stand-
ards and fundus camera functional standards, and (2) to demonstrate the ability of the nGoggle fundus camera
to capture high-quality optical nerve images from a model eye. Successful development of this system will enable
both structural and functional assessments of retinal conditions to be performed easily and inexpensively using
a portable device.PROJECT NARRATIVE
NGoggle Inc. proposes to develop a new wearable ophthalmic diagnostic instrument capable of performing con-
current structural and functional assessment to diagnose and monitor optic neuropathies and retinal diseases.
This project aims at developing a pair of compact high-resolution fundus cameras in full compliance with oph-
thalmic instrument safety standards and integrating them into our neuro-monitoring nGoggle, an instrument with
the demonstrated capability of estimating functional vision loss in glaucoma patients based on their electroen-

biosynthetic Pronged Anchor-Clip to overcome the problems associated with large suture knots (knots from #5
suture, tape suture, and mesh suture). Currently large suture knots risk skin erosion, palpability, pain, scarring,
infection, and may even require re-operation for suture abscess. Replacing a knot with a much smaller device
that has a similar surface area as a knot but a much smaller volume without interstices for bacterial growth and
a better safety profile would have a significant impact in Surgery. Large sutures are typically used for tendon
repair in thin skinned areas such as achilles, rotator cuff, or knee, and for abdominal wall reconstruction.
Compared to competing anchoring technologies (e.g. staple, corkscrew, tack, and strap) the Pronged Anchor-
Clip has several advantages: it withstands soft-tissue loads exceeding the strength of competing devices and
the Pronged Anchor-Clip does not injure fascia when applied. The Pronged Anchor-Clip is easier and faster to
apply than tying a knot, and its intuitive design fits easily into clinical practice.
In addition to the surgical benefits of the project, we will create the first commercial biodegradable high-
resolution medical device manufactured by 3D printing. The proprietary co-crosslinker used in this proposal will
create a novel PPF resin that can then be 3D printed through digital light processing. This revolutionary new
PPF material can be used to create medical devices with micro-features that will eventually be resorbed by the
body. This would be unlike any other 3D printed biomedical device.
Through our multi-disciplinary collaboration, we will: optimize PPF formulations for 3D printing and confirm
design thresholds for the Pronged Anchor-Clip are met; characterize the 3D printed PPF Pronged Anchor-Clips
in benchtop testing for: mechanical properties; in vitro degradation rates; potential for infection; and clinically
relevant suture retention performance in cadaver tissue models; and lastly, demonstrate PPF Pronged Anchor-
Clips respond appropriately for bioincorporation, inflammation, and in vivo degradation in swine relative to a
predicate device, per FDA guidance document ISO 10993. At the completion of this proposal we will have
established manufacturing and performance proof points; demonstrating the PPF Pronged Anchor-Clip is
superior to a bulky knot. In a follow-on Phase II SBIR submission, we will complete validation and verification
testing, packaging and sterilization, toxicity testing, ISO 10993-Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices testing
and a chronic swine study for FDA 510(k) clearance of the class II device. Development of a biodegradable
fixation device with enhanced anchoring strength and reduced inflammation is urgently needed in the field of
soft-tissue repair and the proposed material has broader implications in the field of implantable devices.Project Narrative
Hernia occurrence and recurrence and tendon reconstruction are major medical problems that
affect hundreds of thousands of patients per year in the United States and cost billions of dollars
annually. Broad suture (e.g. #5 suture, tape suture, and mesh suture) are commonly used in
repairs but require large knots which are susceptible to pain, infection, foreign body response,
and palpability. DBMA, Inc. proposes to develop a small biosynthetic Pronged Anchor-Clip to
overcome the need for large knots.",  ,,,,DAVID  RUPPERT,,(207) 752-3128,david@deepbluemedical.com,,  ,

While the benefits of breastfeeding throughout the first year of a baby’s life are widely accepted in the medical community, 60% of mothers do not succeed in sustained breastfeeding. The success or failure of breastfeeding is dependent upon a baby getting enough milk, and currently there is no objective method of determining the amount of milk a baby is receiving and how much residual milk remains in the breasts. The proposed device will collect objective data that will help mothers overcome challenges in breastfeeding and avoid further complications like clogged ducts and/or mastitis. Specifically, the device will help mothers track their milk output accurately, therefore reaching lactation goals, and allow mothers to ensure that babies receive the required nutrition to thrive during the early stages of life. The depersonalized data collected from the bra will enable medical professionals and researchers to gain insights about human milk production volumes and factors influencing milk production and infant health, thereby expanding horizons for further research in this field. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will create a proof-of-concept prototype bra that utilizes textile-based sensors to accurately measure the volume of milk expressed during a breastfeeding/breast pumping session. This project will lay important groundwork to create the first medical device using embedded fabric sensor technology to determine three data points: breast emptiness, milk volume output per session and changes in breast milk production over time. Research will focus on the design of the sensors and the form-factor of the bra that will facilitate capturing accurate data. There will be associated data capture and analysis demonstrating both measurable metric data trends to inform breastfeeding moms and aggregate cohort-level data trends for high level data analysis in an area with a paucity of actual data. When in use, the bra will be fitted to women while breastfeeding or pumping and be able to determine both the milk depletion and residual volume in the milk ducts and the volume of milk produced. After completing additional R&D, the product will perform three different functions: 1) determine the degree of breast emptiness; 2) measure the volume of milk expressed per session; 3) detect early risk of clogged ducts to avoid mastitis.

This is important, as existing commercial sunscreens suffer from five significant problems: (1) A large proportion of marketed sunscreens are ineffective at protecting skin from UV radiation. (2) Over 65% of non-mineral sunscreens contain chemicals that are toxic to marine ecosystems (i.e., ocean’s coral reefs).

Through a low-footprint vertical greenhouse design, this technology will enable individuals to grow produce on small areas of available space for their community. The produce will be an attractive alternative to large-scale industrial agriculture and foreign food imports, not only for sustainability concerns, but through its superior freshness, quality, and taste. This project will have an impact on the advancement of local farming technologies to further the viability of commercial food production in urban communities. Creating an economically viable urban farm will have lasting impacts on the U.S. food system and environment as it will provide a means for sustainable food production. The Phase I effort will be used to design, build, and demonstrate a subscale vertical farm prototype that demonstrates cost-effective methods for all aspects of the farm’s end-to-end labor automation. This will advance the implementation of robotics in food production by addressing the labor and energy barriers that local controlled environmental agriculture systems currently face.

Human interaction with the grow process will be limited through high degree of system automation, including computer vision for plant inspections and self-cleaning processes. Novel plant growth and handling processes will allow for virtually any type of produce. A variety of sensors are used to carefully monitor conditions and adjust the system, allowing fresh produce in areas without suitable agricultural opportunities.

The proposal is to develop an RNA-based multi-antigen SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, supporting NIAID’s call to develop
a vaccine using emerging antigen design strategies and novel delivery approaches. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic
is actively threatening public health, world economies, and ways of life. Vaccine candidates are in human trials
now, but long-term solutions will require an adaptable vaccine system that can be universalized broadly to all
members of the coronavirus family. Tiba’s vaccine will be innovative in two respects: 1) The inclusion of all four
structural virion proteins will allow a deeper and potentially broader immune response against coronavirus, as
multiple conserved T cell epitopes will be presented by the vaccine. In addition, the incorporation of structural
proteins besides the Spike (S) protein will allow the formation of immunogenic VLPs in situ. 2) Conventional lipid
nanoparticles (LNPs), which are the mainstay of nucleic acid delivery, require a large proportion of “structural”
lipid, resulting in a relatively low RNA content. Tiba has developed a modified dendrimer delivery molecule that
maximizes RNA mass content, protects RNA from degradation, and enables efficient uptake by cells. This
approach will increase immunogenicity and thus effectiveness of the vaccine. The first Phase 1 Aim is to optimize
candidate payloads comprising M, N, and E mRNA or saRNA. Conventional mRNAs encoding the M, N, and E
proteins will be codon-optimized and lead RNA payloads will then be formulated with Tiba’s modified dendrimer
delivery material. With the M, N, and E payloads generated in both saRNA and mRNA formats, effective
immunogenic doses for each will be determined by injecting six-week-old BALB/c mice with nanoparticles at
different doses. The antigen RNA payloads to proceed for titration into S RNA vaccine candidates will be
selected. The minimum effective dose for each M, N, and E mRNA or saRNA will be roughly estimated using a
regression model. Aim 2 will test the lead candidate payloads along with S in mice. Combination formulations
will be generated wherein different masses of the lead M, N, and E RNAs are titrated into the optimal S mRNA
or saRNA formula to identify a formulation mixture that maximizes M, N, and E cellular immune responses while
not suppressing the S humoral response. Treatment doses will deliver the same mass of S RNA across all
groups, and that optimal mass will be chosen based on the results of dose-finding preliminary studies. Using the
results of the study, two mixtures that confer detectable responses against each virion component while not
suppressing S antibody and T cell responses will be selected as lead candidates. For Aim 3, the lead candidates
will be used in a hamster challenge study. Vaccinations will be performed by i.m. injection in golden Syrian
hamsters. Challenges will be performed using the current best practice. The benchmark of success for this study
is evidence of immune responses against firstly the S component of the vaccine, and concomitant protection
against disease, ideally after a single administration. If successful, further development of lead vaccine
candidates and the path to commercialization will be forthcoming in a Phase 2 SBIR Proposal.Project Narrative
Development of an effective vaccine against coronavirus is critical for world economies, devastated by the
current pandemic, to begin recovery and to save millions from significant illness or death. We propose to produce
a multi-antigen RNA-based prototype vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, utilizing a novel and innovative modified-
dendrimer-based nanoparticle delivery technology that will solve the challenges hindering current single-antigen
nucleic acid vaccine approaches and potentially lead to more broad protection against coronaviruses. The
proposed vaccine product can be easily adapted to include sequences of other coronaviruses with pandemic
potential due to its modular nature, making it a potential approach to multivalent or universal coronavirus
vaccination.",  ,,,,CHRISTIAN W MANDL,,(617) 335-1578,cmandl@tiba.bio,,  ,

Sixteen million Americans are diagnosed with dry eye disease, with likely many more suffering from this issue.
Prevalence is higher among women, increases with age, and is now also notable among those aged 18–34
years. It is characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the tear film and may be accompanied by persistent
symptoms of irritation or burning that can cause inflammatory damage to the cornea and conjunctiva if untreated.
Current eye-drop treatments that work by reducing the inflammation on the ocular service have several
deficiencies that can be frustrating for patients. The immunomodulator, cyclosporine, is commonly prescribed in
these eye drops using a variety of delivery vehicles including anionic emulsions, cationic nanoemulsions, or
nanomicellar solutions. However, the impact of the vehicle to prolong corneal residence is still limited due to
natural ocular defensive mechanisms. This is believed to be one reason that the common dry eye disease
treatment by such eye drops do not have better or faster efficacy in clinical trials. The project team proposes to
incorporate cyclosporine into a contact lens to better deliver the active ingredient and potentially with fewer side
effects as the dosing is better controlled. It is known that drug delivery from a contact lens can result in several
times higher bioavailability than eye drops due to the direct transfer of a drug to cornea across a thin tear layer.
Using our dual layer contact lens platform and charged boundary layer technology we will resolve the deficiencies
of current therapy by (1) Delivering cyclosporine at low concentration consistently for 8 hours/day using a drug
eluting contact lens to allow a precise accumulation of cyclosporine on corneal surface, (2) Delivering
cyclosporine loaded cationic nanocarriers from a novel drug eluting contact lens to improve the nanocarrier
adhesion to cornea and conjunctiva surface and enhance cyclosporine penetration into the anterior chamber,
(3) Conducting in vitro cell-based cytotoxicity studies of the nanocarriers and by means of an ex vivo porcine
eye model measure cyclosporine corneal penetration efficacy of the drug eluting contact lens devices.PROJECT NARRATIVE
In the United States, over 16 million individuals are diagnosed with dry eye disease and often with suboptimal
outcomes because of poor adherence and limited effectiveness of prescribed topical eye drop medications. Dry
eye disease can substantially affect vision and quality of life, as symptoms often interfere with daily activities,
and prevalence rates range from 5% to 50%, but can be as high as 75% among adults over age 40, with women
most often affected. We propose to develop a novel contact lens device for treatment of dry eye disease that
can precisely transport anti-inflammation agents to the eye with the therapeutic agent(s) delivered even more
effectively by incorporation of ocular penetrating nanocarriers.",  ,,,,ROMAN  DOMSZY,,(717) 696-8917,roman@lynthera.com,,  ,

Cell secretions are fundamental to biological processes, biotechnology, and cell therapies. The ability to analyze
and select out single cells based on secretions is particularly critical for the rapid development of monoclonal
antibody therapies. This need was highlighted recently with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic. Distributed
capabilities to screen and sort B-cells, hybridoma cells, and producer cells (e.g CHO) based on quantitative
secretion phenotype can accelerate the discovery and development of therapeutic neutralizing antibodies and
aid in production of antigenic proteins for vaccine development. A key challenge is the screening of producer cell
lines for productivity, which can take months and require significant manual intervention. Emphasizing the critical
need, several microfluidic platforms have been developed for the automated screening of antibody secreting
cells. However, these systems require specialized expertise or commercial equipment that is not widely
available, and the number of cells that can be analyzed remains small. Thus, there is a critical need for high-
throughput cell screening workflows that do not rely on new capital equipment. To address this bottleneck,
Partillion plans to transition a lab-on-a-particle technological breakthrough, highlighted as the SLAS Innovation
Award winner in 2020, into our first reagent product that enables customers to use their standard flow sorter
machines for the selection of producer cell lines that secrete antibodies and other recombinant products. Our
technology is based on microscale crescent-shaped hydrogel nanovials which capture cells, are functionalized
to capture secretions, and template the formation of millions of uniform drops within seconds, all with simple
pipetting and centrifugation steps. These drops prevent the loss and cross-talk of secretions. Particles and
associated cells can then be sorted with flow cytometers based on the amount of secreted product at much
higher rates than current techniques. In this Phase I SBIR, we will engineer and validate our reagent-based
product to work robustly with antibody producing CHO cell lines. We will develop workflows for compatibility on
a number of standard, commercially available flow cytometers in order to ensure ease of adoption by a wider
customer base. We will also increase single-cell loading efficiency of the nanovials, beating Poisson-governed
loading by 30-fold, to reduce the number of cell doublets and increase throughput in order to be able to screen
larger populations for rarer or more high-producing clones in a single run. At the completion of the proposed
work we will have demonstrated the ability to sort through andgt; 1 million clones in a work day, orders of magnitude
higher than current technologies. Successful completion of our project will result in reagents with immediate
impact in enabling distributed development and production of antibodies for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.NARRATIVE
We will develop accessible “lab on a particle” technology that enables the scalable selection of cell lines that
produce more antibodies and other bio-products. These new reagents promise to enable more rapid and
distributed development and cost-effective manufacturing of biological products critical for new therapies and
diagnostic tests.",  ,,,,JOSEPH  DERUTTE,,(707) 529-3034,jderutte@partillion.com,,  ,

Such a device will be an invaluable assistance to dermatologists and dermatologic surgeons and significantly enhance the current state of skin cancer detection and management. The proposed system will be integrated in a single framework, resulting in a compact (handheld) and real-time imager at a low manufacturing cost. This will make the proposed technology comparable in cost to dermoscopic imaging, facilitating its widespread use and application. The proposed device will also be able to identify tumor margins in the millimeter-wave images of skin lesions. This capability will simplify the tumor removal surgery to a single-layer excision procedure. The proposed imager will be used by dermatologists and dermatologic surgeons prior to biopsy or tumor excision, facilitating the detection and removal of tumors. This Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) Phase I project is focused on developing a fully-integrated ultra-wideband millimeter-wave imaging system for the first time. This will be realized by employing the synthetic ultra-wideband imaging approach, where several disjointed, adjacent imaging sub-bands are integrated to collectively form an ultra-wide imaging bandwidth. Each sub-band contains a transmitting and a receiving element that operate only within that specific sub-band. In this research, the RF front-ends of sub-band phased-array antennas will be developed and integrated with the transceiver components of the imaging system on a single chip. The developed phased arrays will be configured to radiate and collect RF frequencies over different frequency sub-bands, while forming independent beams with separate phase-shifting operations. Therefore, electronic beam-steering can be used for scanning the target region. In addition, a novel method for tumor margin identification in 3-D millimeter-wave images is proposed in which a-priori information about the statistical distribution of the dielectric properties of tissues is employed. This will result in a more accurate segmentation of the dielectric properties at a low computational cost. The ultra-wide bandwidth of the proposed imager will result in significantly higher image resolutions compared to the state-of-the-art millimeter-wave imaging technology.

Abalone Bio will develop antibody (Ab) drugs that inhibit intestinal inflammation to treat inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD). IBD comprises chronic, debilitating, idiopathic inflammatory diseases that result in severe dam-
age to the gut wall, including Crohnandapos;s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The primary etiology is chronic
inflammation, which causes pain, diarrhea, weight loss, fever, bleeding ulcers, fistulas, and abscesses in the
abdomen and perianal region, and CD patients develop obstructive intestinal fibrosis that must be surgically
removed. There is an unmet need for long-acting, broadly applicable disease-modifying, and pain-reliev-
ing IBD therapies. There are currently immunomodulators effective as disease-modifying therapies; however,
some patients do not respond to them, they have adverse side effects, and their efficacies wane over time. To
address this need, we used our proprietary Ab discovery platform to identify first-of-their-kind Ab agonists for a
G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), the cannabinoid receptor CB2. CB2 has immunomodulatory functions in
many diseases that affect several body systems. In humans, CB2 is constitutively expressed in immune cells,
and its expression is broadly induced in IBD, including in the colon. Consistently, CB2 function has been firmly
linked to IBD: (1) CB2-KO mice are more susceptible to IBD in disease models, and (2) a common partial loss-
of-function CB2 allele has been associated with increased risk of IBD in humans. CB2 agonism has limited
adverse effects, and it can suppress inflammation in the gut and elsewhere, and, in contrast to CB1
agonism, it is not psychoactive. Abalone’s CB2-specific agonist Abs have many advantages over small-mole-
cule CB2 agonist drug candidates, including CNS exclusion and high specificity, which minimize CB1 activation.
Furthermore, Abs are natural proteins; thus, they are unlikely to have unexpected adverse effects due to chem-
ical by-products. We will test the hypothesis that Abalone’s CB2 agonist Abs are feasible pre-clinical IBD thera-
peutic candidates with anti-inflammatory effects. Our three major aims are (1) to engineer, produce, and char-
acterize CB2 agonist Ab variants based on previously isolated and characterized agonist hits; (2) to eval-
uate the anti-inflammatory activity of these CB2 agonist Abs on human immune cells; and (3) to assess
the effects of the top CB2 agonist Abs in two complementary IBD mouse models. Successful completion
of this Phase I project will validate this strategy for the treatment of IBD and will pave the way for further devel-
opment of these Ab drugs. Although this SBIR application focuses on IBD, Abalone’s CB2 agonist Ab drugs are
applicable to other inflammatory, chronic pain, and fibrotic diseases. Compared with small-molecule drugs, bio-
logics have an excellent safety record, which supports development and approval for clinical trials and increased
odds of marketing.NARRATIVE
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are idiopathic, debilitating disorders caused by chronic intestinal inflamma-
tion, and life-disrupting symptoms include pain, diarrhea, weight loss, fever, bleeding ulcers, fistulas, abscesses

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder that affects andgt;3 million Americans and is a
major cause of stroke. Since AF is primarily an age-related disease, it is fast becoming an epidemic in a rapidly
aging population. Unfortunately, current therapeutic approaches to AF – both pharmacological and ablation-
based - are sub-optimal in patients with persistent AF. This is thought to be because current treatments do not
target the fundamental, molecular signaling pathways that cause AF. In this Fast-Track SBIR proposal, Rhythm
Therapeutics, Inc (RTI) proposes a radically different approach to AF that targets major molecular mechanisms
underlying AF. Using technology licensed from Northwestern University, RTI proposes an innovative, gene
therapy strategy to target oxidative injury, which is a fundamental, ‘upstream’ biological mechanism that
controls key ‘downstream’ signaling pathways contributing to electrical and structural remodeling in AF. The
technical innovation of RTI’s strategy is two-fold: i) use of NOX2 shRNA to inhibit NOX2, a major enzymatic
source of oxidative injury in the atria and ii) a new, trans-venous method of gene delivery that facilitates
endocardial gene delivery by using electroporation; for this purpose, we will use a catheter (FirMap, Abbott-St.
Jude) that is currently approved for electrophysiological mapping of AF.
RTI’s overarching goal is develop a new, mechanism-guided therapy for AF that has at least 25% greater
efficacy than ablation in patients with persistent AF. The goal of this Fast-Track SBIR is to perform
Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling pre-clinical studies with RTI’s combination product. The hypothesis
underlying this Phase II SBIR is ‘Electroporation mediated delivery of NOX2 shRNA via a trans-venous route:
a) attenuates electrical/structural remodeling in AF in a linear, dose-dependent fashion and b) has a favorable
safety profile’. In Phase I, Specific Aim 1, RTI will determine the optimal electroporation parameters for trans-
venous atrial gene delivery using the FirMap catheter. In Phase II, Specific Aim 1, we will determine the
optimal therapeutic dose of NOX2 shRNA that prevents atrial fibrosis in a heart failure model of AF. In Phase
II, Specific Aim 2, we will determine: a) the optimal therapeutic dose of NOX2 shRNA that reverses
established electrical remodeling in a rapid atrial pacing model of AF and b) the duration of efficacy of NOX2
shRNA in reversing AF in the same AF model. In Phase II, Specific Aim 3, RTI will conduct pivotal toxicology
and bio-distribution studies with its combination product. AF is a $2 billion + market. RTI’s therapeutic
approach, if successful, is expected to significantly improve upon the success of current pharmacological and
ablation strategies for AF, and thereby lead to a paradigm shift in management of AF.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder and is a major cause of stroke. The incidence
of AF increases with age, making it an ‘epidemic’ in an aging population. Unfortunately, current treatments for
AF have low efficacy. In this SBIR, Rhythm Therapeutics (RTI) proposes a radically new treatment for AF that
targets a key molecular mechanism – called oxidative injury – that underlie the AF disease state. RTI’s
approach will use a novel biological agents (gene) to target this mechanism. This new treatment is expected to
significantly decrease the burden of AF in patients that would typically be resistant to current treatments for AF
(e.g. ablation, drugs).",  ,,,,ROBERT C MOEN,,(216) 534-6164,rcmoen@hotmail.com,,  ,

Research has proven the beneficial effects of applying living probiotics directly to skin, and there are emerging needs to deliver such probiotics alive in topical creams. However, applications of biologics are currently limited because of the challenges associated with its inactivation/decomposition during production, transport, storage, which often lead to low delivery efficacy and constraints in product type. Additionally, current biologic-containing products often have short shelf-life and high refrigeration cost. This project will create a robust encapsulation platform tailored toward delivering living probiotics in topical skin formulations featuring long storage capabilities, while providing critical methods for prospective biologic-related applications. This project will enable novel biologic therapeutic applications. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop solutions to prolong probiotics’ survival in complex water-oil skin formulations utilizing microencapsulation technology. Multiple studies have validated the advantageous effect of active probiotics for skin health; however, development of topical probiotic products remains a great challenge as the probiotics must remain active and viable within formulations during long storage periods. To mitigate such challenges, this proposal will focus on integrity-enhanced microstructures that can encase, immobilize and sustain living-probiotic cells in a highly moisturized environment. Different types of probiotic-enriched skin moisturizer formulations will be developed, and the viability and stability of probiotics will be studied under accelerated storage conditions. Specifically, this project will improve the stability and viability of probiotics in skincare formulations by carrying out detailed analysis on: (1) the processing parameters and operating temperatures to encase probiotics; (2) developing formulations using suitable probiotic-friendly ingredients; (3) the stabilities of the microencapsulation microstructures and probiotic compatibility; (4) probiotic viabilities stored under different pH and temperature conditions; (5) probiotics’ interaction with antimicrobial agents; and (6) the release and delivery of probiotics from the formulation.

Reliable qualification is especially important for safety-critical aerospace applications, as only parts that can be fully inspected can be certified for flight. In a previous NASA SBIR project, we demonstrated the feasibility of filling this gap by applying laser ultrasonic testing (LUT) for nondestructive evaluation of each AM deposited layer in real time as it is formed.

These systems use a disposable cartridge containing 35%-59% (wt) liquid H2O2 that is punctured when activated to release and vaporize hydrogen peroxide. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide offers several appealing features for sterilization that include rapid cycle time (e.g., 30-45 minutes), low temperature processing in the range of 20-40 °C, environmentally safe by-products of H2O and O2, and good material compatibility. One method for delivering VHP to the process chamber is to pull a deep vacuum to 1-3 Torr that extracts liquid hydrogen peroxide from its canister through a heated cartridge into the sterilization chamber. Another method is to vaporize the hydrogen peroxide and use a carrier gas such as air to deliver the VHP to the sterilization chamber. However, the present VHP systems are problematic in that they require EPA regulated and controlled concentrated H2O2 canisters for each activation. This gets to be expensive and wasteful especially since H2O2 decomposes relatively fast giving the canisters a short shelf life. Furthermore, supplying these concentrated H2O2 canisters complicates logistics making the use of these large scale VHP sterilizer units problematic for military operations. One manner to overcome these difficulties with using concentrated H2O2 canisters is to generate liquid H2O2 on-site as it gets fed to the large size vaporized hydrogen peroxide sterilizer units.

Among the various neuromorphic sensor designs, we propose to incorporate Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) based event cameras, which perform power-efficient visual monitoring by emulating the human visual system. Instead of densely sampling each pixel at a fixed temporal frequency, as traditional cameras do, DVS-based cameras asynchronously report events at pixels where irradiance has changed significantly. This reduces power consumption in the sensor and produces a sparser set of image data that, in turn, requires less compute intensive processing. In addition to reduced power consumption, this proposal describes event camera advantages that will allow for accurate missile detection against a wider range of backgrounds and reduce the time to alert. In Phase I, we will carry out system design work and develop prototype detection, tracking, and threat recognition algorithms.

To reduce the size of a heavy-ion accelerator and to bring the accelerator to the end users, we turn our attention to lasers. Short-pulse (fs) lasers capable of high powers and high intensities are useful for the generation and acceleration of ions. The interaction of an intense laser pulse with a dense target can generate short (~ps) collimated ion beams with energies up to GeV range and high repetition rates as well as extremely high beam intensities and ion fluencies. Such ion pulses are difficult to attain with conventional radio-frequency accelerators. Here we will explore several laser-driven ion generation and acceleration schemes and trade these against the available real estate gradient. Our objective is to develop a pathway to a brand-new ion source and a brand-new accelerator that are specifically designed for high-energy, heavy-ion beam testing of electronics bound for space applications.

First, develop inexpensive, persistent, infrared optical arrays, using modern optical array sensors and their signal processing systems. The proposed prototype IOA is based on the two operating PANDORA (Persistent And Optically Redundant Array) Tau visible arrays. Second, The Tau tracking optical arrays utilize machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) image processing techniques for streak detection and analysis. This capability provides for moving target identification, and enhanced long-range detection at low Signal to Noise Ration (SNR) or in image clutter. The ML, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms replicate processing techniques found in the insect world, where large arrays of very simple detectors are optimized for specialized wide-field imaging tasks. The use of large arrays of simple sensors provides numerous detection and tracking advantages over large, gimbaled, monolithic sensors. Each eye of the fly can detect multiple objects while staring over a hemispherical FOV. Additionally, this imaging sensor approach can degrade “gracefully” – loss of one or a few sensors can be tolerated, since a very high percentage of sensors remain in operation. A key part of our proposed program will be expanding our previous streak detection and image processing program with the Klipsch School of Electric and Computer Engineering at New Mexico State University (NMSU).

To achieve equivalent accurate execution of “as is” software on current lower performance hardware requires that new hardware be modeled and executed in a powerful virtual environment. Thus, we propose to enable the current time source of the KVM to act as an accurate timing source interoperable with the simulation time manager to support execution of “as is” operational software on a KVM. Currently the KVM TSCR controls timing of executed instruction sequences. It emulates the Linux TSCR that is keyed to wall-clock time for virtualization use. We propose that instead of virtualization, the TSCR will be modified to support non-real-time simulation. In contrast to real-time simulation, time in non-real-time simulation does not flow naturally, but requires a simulation coordinator to determine the advance of time as dictated by events/and or steps. The RTSync team, consisting of RTSync and Oak Ridge National Laboratory proposes that the DEVS formalism provides the requisite theoretical and practical basis for development of the proposed architecture. The DEVS formalism will provide the concepts required to correctly place the KVM under external simulation time management. This will require making changes to KVM code to consult the simulation time manager to set the appropriate TSCR value. The simulation time manager will be modeled by the coordinator of the DEVS distributed simulation protocol and we will develop associated DEVS model realizations of the other components.

International FemtoScience (FemtoSci) proposes a practical solution to produce Inherently Radiation Hardened Microelectronic Components by employing diamond emitter vacuum device technology. These components have demonstrated that diamond emission diodes and transistors will operate unaffected, with no change in their performance, to extremely high radiation levels and at temperatures greater than 400 C. This is not possible with a band gap governed solid state device such as silicon-based devices. The proposed device technology is completely insensitive to all levels and all types of natural space and nuclear radiation and therefore requires no radiation protection methods. Designing, fabricating, and testing the individual proof-of-principle prototype diamond vacuum emission devices in Phase I will substantiate their performance and, through analysis, their ability to survive and operate through space and nuclear radiation. The real benefit is when the individual diamond vacuum emission devices are combined and integrated monolithically to form functional radiation immune circuits. The proposed diamond vacuum emission devices are functionally equivalent to transistors and can be used to realize analog circuits such as operational amplifiers and comparators, digital circuits such as logic functions and gate arrays, and even extended to field programmable gate arrays. The technology proposed by FemtoSci in conjunction with our STTR university partner, University of Tennessee Space Institute (UTSI) has the potential for a technology breakthrough for missile system electronic system designs for Space, Microelectronics, and Hypersonic technology areas.

Atom interferometers have unmatched precision for in-situ measurements of local gravity acceleration. The Size, Weight, and Power consumption (SWaP) of existing atom interferometers is a major obstacle for employing them in NASA missions. One of the main components of an atom interferometer is an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system. UHV chambers are typically the heaviest components of atom interferometers. A light, compact, and energy-efficient UHV system will be highly beneficial for NASA missions.nbsp;In this proposal, Q-Peak is addressing the need for lighter, compact, energy-efficient UHV systems suitable for atom interferometer.

The aluminum alloy can be machined using a metallic powder bed fusion process that removes the constraint of traditional manufacturing considerations. Furthermore, Q-Peak will focus on developing passive pumping based on non-evaporable getter pumps. Passive pumping can reduce the energy consumption of an UHV system. Other aspects of the UHV system suitable for atom cooling experiment will be addressed: bonding vacuum windows to the aluminum alloy, energy-efficient and reliable alkali-atom sources, and so on.nbsp; The developed UHV system will find direct application to atom interferometers, drastically reducing their SWaP without compromising residual gas pressure and optical access.nbsp;",NASA SBIR  Support Office,,(301) 937-0888,sbir@reisystems.com,Vladyslav  Ivanov,,(781) 271-1838,vivanov@qpeak.com,,  ,

While specific haemopoietic protein variants have been used as medical countermeasures (MCM) for ARS, several recent studies have identified need for inclusion of other targets to provide more effective radiation-exposure treatment. Recent multi-omics studies and radiobiological insights have also provided new gene targets to act as radiation MCM. Using a range of different proteins poses significant challenges and associated logistical challenges in their safe transportation and storage during space travel. Existing genetic manipulation methods are laborious, expensive, and inefficient.

Eg., GM-CSF FASTmer demonstrated large-scale immunomodulation and specific haemopoietic protein regulation in human PBMCs during acute radiation exposure (3Gy). During this proposal, we will use individual FASTmers targeting specific genes related to ARS, and evaluate their efficacy using specific haemopoietic proteins and cytokine markers. Based on their efficacy, the top-ranked candidates will be evaluated as a combination therapy. Using detailed fractional factorial design and ensuing statistical analysis, we will identify the: 1) top therapeutic targets for ARS, both in monotherapy and combinations; and 2) ranked FASTmers as therapeutic assets for mono- and combination therapy, to further test and validate in animal and clinical testing (Phase II SBIR).",NASA SBIR  Support Office,,(301) 937-0888,sbir@reisystems.com,Prashant  Nagpal,,(720) 361-2159,nagpal@sachibio.com,,  ,

While IDS are a valuable component of a defense-in-depth strategy, they often require significant compute power, can be energy-hungry, run on heavy hardware, may require access to high-bandwidth external cloud-based threat analysis services, and tend to miss new (previously unseen) threats.  Clearly, these systems cannot meet the desirable properties of a modern, accurate, adaptive, and highly portable cyber-protection kit. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a novel “near plug-and-play” (i.e., easy to setup and run) cyber-protection system that will enable CPTs to quickly identify network communications related to threats currently present in the network under investigation. Our technical approach will be based on the PIs’ extensive academic research and industry experience on network-based threat detection and defense and will make use of efficient traffic models and analysis methods to accurately detect anomalous network behaviors with minimal storage, bandwidth, and compute power. The proposed solution aims to allow CPTs to promptly locate the sources of malicious traffic inside a network and to significantly accelerate threat containment and neutralization efforts. Besides providing novel real-time network threat detection capabilities, the proposed cyber-protection system will also provide access to external advanced threat correlation and attribution capabilities recently developed by co-PI Dr. Manos Antonakakis under the DARPA Enhanced Attribution program (https://www.darpa.mil/program/enhanced-attribution). These threat intelligence and attribution capabilities will be available to CPTs at mission time, and will be designed to operate in low-bandwidth, high-latency environments. When needed, the proposed threat detection system will also be able to operate autonomously, in deployment environments in which access to external threat intelligence is not at all possible (e.g., in case of zero bandwidth or insurmountable constraints imposed by existing network policies). Furthermore, threat intelligence capabilities will be available to CPTs after mission, to improve postmortem forensic investigations and threat attribution.  ",Anthony  Macera,,(315) 330-4480,anthony.macara.1@us.af.mil,Adam  Kauffman,,(678) 592-1011,adam@notostech.com,,  ,

Electro-Optical Infrared (EO/IR) can provide recognition of moving targets, but their operability is limited by darkness and degraded visual environments (DVEs) such as clouds, smoke, dust, fog, and haze. Radar systems provide all-weather ISR capability and are capable of identifying static targets, but they are typically not capable of producing imagery of moving targets in high-enough resolution to support target recognition. To address the warfighter’s need for responsive target location and recognition, IMSAR LLC is proposing to leverage its low-SWaP high-performance radar systems to process high-resolution SAR imagery to detect, geolocate, image, and recognize moving targets Detection, identification, and tracking of moving objects in SAR signals is necessary in both civil and military applications. However, SAR processing assumes the ground is static, and moving targets can cause errors in SAR images, such as defocusing and target displacement. Radars use Moving Target Indication (MTI) mode to detect moving targets. To reliably image moving ground targets for ATR, the target position and attitude must be known to a higher degree of accuracy than what a single radar can provide. Also, radar geolocation accuracy from MTI is highly range dependent in the cross-range dimension, as radar angle accuracy is usually 1-2 orders of magnitude higher in angle variance than an EO/IR sensor.  During Phase I, IMSAR successfully performed advanced methods of SAR data collection using two radars simultaneously collecting data on moving targets. Using post-processing techniques with truth data, the SAR data was used to accurately determine the location and velocity of moving targets. By constraining the target’s path and taking a directional derivative across a Digital Elevation Map (DEM) slope, IMSAR will estimate the combined pitch/roll needed to estimate the moving target’s orientation. For Phase II, IMSAR will partner with Atmospheric and Environmental Research (AER), who will further develop MTR algorithms for target recognition.  ",Madeleine  Jensen,,(850) 872-8569,madeleine.jensen@us.af.mil,Ivan  Ashcraft,,(801) 798-8440,ivan.ashcraft@imsar.com,,  ,

Project SummaryProject Title: An efficient greens spinner for improving food safety and increasingprofitability for small to mid-size farmsPD Bradford Waugh Johnny's Selected SeedsProblem or Opportunity. America's small to mid-size farms struggle to survive and maintainprofitability. Many barriers exist preventing these farms from scaling operations such as a lack ofavailable farm equipment customized for small-scale operations and labor-intensive practicescommon to small farms. Leafy greens producers in particular have high operating costs associatedwith the labor inputs needed for postharvest handling and processing. Johnny's Selected Seedsproposes to develop a cost-effective labor-saving and hygienic electric greens spinner for smallfarms that will vastly improve handling capacity for leafy greens. Increased cost-efficiency fromlabor-saving technologies such as this can reduce the per unit cost of products enabling farms toscale operations to satisfy demand of more profitable distribution channels such as intermediatechannels in local markets that require consistent large quantities of produce. The proposed greensspinner will improve the profitability of small leafy greens farmers by enabling them to increaseoutput and will follow a hygienic and sanitary design that will prevent water harborage and cross-
contamination improving the food safety of leafy greens.Project Objectives. 1. Develop a prototype electric greens spinner for small farms that increaseshandling and processing capacity reduces labor costs and prevents water harborage and cross-
contamination. 2. Conduct market feasibility testing to inform pricing strategy and salesprojections critical to the development of a successful commercialization plan.Description of Phase I Effort. Design and fabricate a small-scale electric greens spinner incollaboration with manufacturing consultants and sanitation certification specialists; conduct in-
house endurance testing of the prototype at the machine shop and trial the product on Johnny'sresearch farm. Complete a logistics assessment to determine the operational strategy formanufacturing the commercialized product. In partnership with agricultural business andeconomics researchers conduct a preliminary value chain analysis to identify the size and locationof the market needed to scale and a customer survey to determine baseline data as to the types ofcustomers most interested in an electric greens spinner and to project the market size.Anticipated Results and Potential Commercial Applications.

Indeed, a key component of the 2019 National Defense Strategy is developing and maintaining dominance in hypersonic weapon systems. While airbreathing hypersonic strike weapons have the potential to provide significant tactical advantages due to their speed, range, and maneuverability, they have a significant disadvantage: the dual mode ramjets (DMRJs) which power these weapons concepts have no low speed propulsion ability and require a solid rocket booster to get them up to the speed at which they can run, typically around Mach 4. This booster can comprise up over 40% of the gross weight and over a third of the total stack length of an all up round. Critically, this places severe constraints on the internal carriage of hypersonic airbreathing missiles on the F-35 and especially on the F-22 with its smaller bays.  As well, for the same AUR mass, if more of the weight is carried as rocket fuel instead of more efficient fuel for the airbreathing portion of the cycle, the range of the weapon will be limited. In order to enable hypersonic strike weapons compatible with the needs of the joint force, new, advanced propulsion alternatives to solid rocket boosters are required. In the phase I, the feasibility of replacing a rocket booster with a high Mach turbine coupled with a plasma-piloted dual mode ramjet to form a turbine based combined cycle missile was studied via reduced order trajectory studies and found to have the potential for significant system level benefits. In the phase I effort, the proposers also conducted interviews with various AF stakeholders to determine system requirements for hypersonic cruise missiles. Based on these systems requirements, the proposers will take a systems engineering approach, using various reduced order codes such as RJPA, and the Spacework's Quickshot code 3-DOF to conduct preliminary trade studies on a candidate combined cycle hypersonic cruise missile design. The proposed phase II effort will focus on a combined experimental and modeling effort to ground test a prototype demonstrator engine as well as conduct trajectory studies together with a major defense contractor to evaluate feasibility of using a turbine-based combined cycle architecture for future air-launched hypersonic cruise missiles as well as more broadly, the potential mission benefits the proposed technology may have for high speed air breathing weapons. The proposed turbine-based combined cycle architecture would leverage improvements in low-cost, attritable turbines as well as in plasma-assisted combustion for improved mode transition performance. ",Madeleine  Jensen,,(850) 872-8569,madeleine.jensen@us.af.mil,Felipe  Gomez del Campo,,(954) 591-1429,Felipe.gomez@fgcplasma.com,,  ,

The seeker delivered closes the gap on passive seekers able to target adversary counter-stealth radar operating between 100 MHz and 2 GHz (VHF and L-band). Additionally, it is readily extensible to target higher frequency search and engagement radar (S to X band) and the data and voice links that network and integrate them within an air defense complex. The capabilities of the seeker include wide field-of-view to enable missile launch from non-line-of-sight and beyond the horizon air platforms with target acquisition during ingress. The passive nature of the seeker enables extended range by homing on the radar’s powerful emissions and increases munition survivability by reducing/eliminating the missile’s own RF signature. The small size increases the number of missiles/munitions that can be stored in internal carriage. The size of the seeker is compact enough to allow a complementary imaging or active RF sensor to counter radar shutdown. The passive seeker of this effort is based on ASI’s recent advance in small form-factor, ultrawideband (UWB), HF to 18 GHz, vector sensor technology for DF and geolocation that has been demonstrated in flight tests on manned aircraft, small UAS and tethered UAS. The technology is implemented with miniature, Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS), semiconductor components to achieve small size and low cost without sacrificing capability. The Phase 1 effort completed initial design and electro-magnetic modeling and simulation to layout a  straight line path to further reduce the size of ASI’s technology to fit onto a 6” diameter missile/munition within the time and investment scope of the proposed Phase 2 effort.

A2AD scenarios continue to push conventional strategic platforms to further stand-off ranges, decreasing their mission effectiveness. Toyon proposes the research and development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to optimize swarming of Electronic Warfare (EW)-enabled munitions.  The hypothesized swarm will employ cooperative maneuvers and non-kinetic effects to counter IADS in A2AD zones. To achieve this, the AI must optimize both the joint maneuvers of the swarm and the parameters of onboard EW payloads. Our approach combines Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with multi-agent training.  The combination allows each agent to learn complicated tasks (through deep reinforcement learning) and to master them (through training against an adversarial AI) from the experience gained while competing in a high-fidelity simulated battlefield. In Phase I, a pulse-level EW simulator was developed and integrated with Toyon’s Modular Autonomy Incubator (MAUI) framework to train a proof-of-concept AI to automatically jam an enemy radar (1-v-1). In Phase II, we will develop a preliminary digital twin of a real EW payload being developed by Toyon (a parallel effort) and expand our focus to harder scenarios combining the digital twin, enhanced EW simulator, and realistic threat models.  Agent models will be designed for both red-side and blue-side AI agents and large-scale multi-agent training will be performed on a high-performance computing cluster to optimize their underlying policy networks.

GVD has demonstrated that our SignalSeal polymer coating system can meet the environmental protection requirements for these structures with minimal impact on RF performance. The goal of these efforts is to evaluate SignalSeal coatings for present commercial offerings. GVD will address the needs of these devices by modifying existing equipment to accommodate larger assemblies and achieve the required throughput for pilot scale manufacturing. GVD will also validate these SignalSeal coatings on DAHI devices comprised of III-V materials. Demonstrations to date on DAHI devices have been restricted due to the costs and complexities. GVD will look to overcome these restrictions by working with subject matter experts and strategic partners to design custom low-cost III-V devices that permit validation testing on high fidelity substrates. Although SignalSeal materials have yielded promising results, the conformality of deposition from the current process limits the applicability of the coating to bare die and surface mounted assemblies. Complex 3-D microstructures and assemblies possess high aspect ratio features that require the use of prohibitively high nominal coating thicknesses to ensure adequate environmental protection within all areas of the assembly. In this program, GVD will address this limitation of the current processing approach by developing a novel chemical vapor deposition process that will significantly improve coating conformality of the SignalSeal material system and further reduce the RF impact of environmental protection when coating complex 3-D microstructures and assemblies. The new proprietary method is centered around using highly stable initiator molecules for the initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) of SignalSeal. Conventional initiators, while highly reactive, have high sticking probabilities, resulting in gas transport issues that lead to significantly reduced coating conformality. The novel process will enable the synthesis of alternative initiators that are much more stable and eliminate the need to transport high energy initiators in the gas phase. This approach will also eliminate the need for filaments or harsh plasma which can generate other uniformity issues. GVD anticipates that this process will increase coating conformality by up to 200%, reducing the RF impact of SignalSeal on surface structures by 50-80%.  The end result will be a uniquely capable coating system that further minimizes RF impact of SignalSeal coatings through thickness reduction and addresses the unmet protection of future microsystems.",Timothy N Hancock,program manager,(571) 218-4529,timothy.hancock@darpa.mil,William  O'Shaughnessy,,(617) 661-0060,soshaughnessy@gvdcorp.com,,  ,

The FSA must accept a total of 12 lbs of pure water prior to each Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA), then supply this water to the cooling loop at ambient suit pressure during the EVA, functioning reliably for up to 15 years of service. To meet these requirements, NASA has specified multiple ultra-pure fluoropolymer bladders captured in restraints providing overpressure tolerance to 38 psi. The assembly must also conform to a defined geometric envelope. Unfortunately, designs to date have failed, for two primary reasons. First, typical constructions involving a lay-flat bladder captured within a sewn textile restraint do not use space efficiently enough to store the required volume within the available space. Second, wrinkles that form as the bladders inflate cause the fluoropolymer membrane to tear. Other challenges include robust mounting to a rigid structure and visual access for inspection. New thinking is required to achieve a viable design.RAPA Technologies has developed a novel defined envelope pressure bladder that meets all specifications for the FSA. The design combines the benefits of a flexible bladder with the strength and convenience of a rigid tank, providing an ultra-pure, ambient-pressure reservoir with high overpressure tolerance, high volumetric efficiency within the available envelope, near-zero dead volume, optical transparency for visual inspection, simplified mounting, and low mass.

At these depths, vast resources of minerals such as cobalt, copper and nickel, which are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles for example, are present in the form of baseball-sized rocks called polymetallic nodules lying on the seabed. Collector machines driving on the seabed and gathering these nodules will stir up clouds of sediment, and there is concern about how the resulting concentration of sediment in the near-bottom ocean water will affect deep-ocean biology. As trials of collector vehicles commence, due to the great pressures at such depths and the remoteness of the locations, there is currently no technology capable of comprehensively monitoring the concentrations and properties of stirred up sediment in the deep ocean. This proposed effort will address the critical technology gap by developing a deep-sea monitoring system that uses novel laser-light scattering technology and high-resolution video imagery, with accompanying image processing, to measure the concentration, size distribution and settling speed of sediment. Very important is that these measurements will be made in-situ, meaning in their original place, since the sediment properties are so fragile that simply bringing up samples from the deep ocean and studying them is not an option.

This new capability will automatically fuse 3D map and radiation data from the GRI Localization and Mapping Platform (LAMP) systems on ground vehicles and unmanned aerial systems (UASs). This capability will be built to track and localize systems in both GPS-enabled and GPS-denied environments from small-scale (e.g. single building) to large areas (1 square km and more). This 3D global radiation mapping and data fusion capability will extend the capabilities of the core GRI-LAMP, which fuses 3D visual data with radiation data from a single LAMP system to create detailed, visual representations of radiological threats and hazards in an environment in real-time. We will accomplish this through continued software and hardware developments based on the initial results from Phase I to extend the 3D global radiation mapping capability to real-time 3D mapping and data fusion. By enhancing LAMP’s edge computing capabilities, we will also enable live updates to the 3D global radiation map as the LAMP systems continuously collect data while moving through an environment on multiple platforms. Phase II developments will build on the developments from Phase I, as we successfully demonstrated the ability to combine multiple 3D radiation maps from LAMP systems on multiple platforms in both GPS-enabled and GPS-denied environments in offline processing over large areas, up to 350,000 square meters. GRI’s 3D, real-time, global mapping capability will significantly reduce end user burden for data collection, aggregation, analysis and communication by providing a single common operating picture through automatic data collection, fusion, and correlation of 3D radiation maps from multiple LAMP systems on manned and unmanned platforms to quickly and efficiently identify threats and hazards for a diverse set of applications.

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This SBIR Fast-Track project will develop a novel non-invasive device for left ventricular dysfunction
assessment to improve heart failure outcomes in patients with diabetes, validated through a multi-center
clinical trial to support FDA 510(k) clearance. According to national diabetes report, 33 million people in United
States suffered from diabetes. Abundant evidence shows diabetes is major independent risk factor for several
cardiovascular disorders including coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, cardiomyopathy,
and congestive heart failure (HF). Large, randomized clinical trials for screening and revascularization of stable
macrovascular disease in diabetics, have failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in cardiac events and
HF episodes. Studies have demonstrated that early detection of left ventricular dysfunction and prevention of
microvascular complications through glycemic control in diabetes patients is a critical mechanism for reducing
the incidence and severity of left ventricular dysfunction and HF. Thus, given the clinical and economic impact
of diabetes and HF, and in view of the risk and cost of invasive monitoring there is a need for non-invasive,
affordable, accurate, absolute and actionable method that can provide point-of-care left ventricular dysfunction
assessment and facilitate optimized management of diabetes patients across the continuity of care. Towards
this goal, Aventusoft has developed a novel non-invasive medical device (HEMOTAG) enabling specific
measurements of left ventricular dysfunction, anywhere, anytime by anyone. Aventusoft has completed
multiple Institutional Review Board approved clinical studies to demonstrate the major clinical advancement.
Phase I and II activities will focus on larger multi-center clinical studies, enhancing the HEMOTAG technology
for hemodynamic guided assessment and management to reduce rates of left ventricular systolic dysfunction,
diastolic dysfunction, and improve HF outcomes in diabetes patients, reducing HF hospitalization, mortality,
and morbidity. Resulting in FDA 510(k) indications of use, for HEMOTAG guided treatment for diabetes
patients. The development of a non-invasive, accurate and easy-to-use solution to provide actionable targets
measurements without requiring blood tests, echocardiogram imaging or right heart catheterization, will have
great potential not only for HF management in diabetes but for many other etiologies as well. Communities
across the globe lack access to quality healthcare arising from shortages in medical expertise and availability
of medical diagnostic devices. The benefit of this pioneering work is the development of a low-cost and
portable solution that enable improved screening during routine annual checkups, doctor visits, at community
medical screenings, classes, and health fairs leading to healthier communities. It will make measuring left
ventricular dysfunction as routine as measuring blood pressure. HEMOTAG verification and validation would
be completed during the Phase II. Followed by commercialization in Florida and nationwide, based on the
business partnerships and clinical collaborations established to help create a commercially successful product.",  ,,,,KAUSTUBH  KALE,,(954) 399-3335,kaustubh@aventusoft.com,,  ,

Abstract
Zika virus epidemics and the association of ZIKV infection with Guillain–Barré syndrome, and
congenital disabilities, including microcephaly, led the World Health Organization to declare
ZIKV a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” in 2016. Since then, various ZIKV
vaccine platforms have been developed to control future epidemics. Historically, live-attenuated
viral vaccines induce long-lasting protective immunity but reduced safety, whereas inactivated
vaccines provide a high level of initial protection but exhibit weak long-term immunity. Third
generation encapsidation-defective flavivirus vaccines have demonstrated surprisingly potent
with high level of safety in animal models. However, they need complicated packaging systemor
helper viral replicons, which make a licenced commercial production difficult and costly.
Recently, we have converted a dual-host ZIKV into a vertebrate-specific replication defective
ZIKV (VSRD-ZIKV; Wan et al in press) which can be efficiently produced at relatively low
cost. In our phase 1 studies, we characterized the safety and efficacy of VSRD-ZIKV in a murine
model. In the proposed phase 2 studies, we propose to: 1) study the genotypic and phenotypic
stability of VSRD-ZIKV during culturing on manufacture cell substrate; 2) develop a seed lot
stock; 3) evaluate the safety and efficacy of VSRD-ZIKV in a non-human primate model. By
completing these goals we hope to produce a vaccine with a high safety and immunogenicity
profile that could be moved toward human clinical trials. To achieve these goals we have
established an experienced team. A strong partnership exists between the Howard University and
Tengen. In addition, both groups will work closely with experts in Bioqual Inc who will be
conducting the NHP trial.",  ,,,,XIAOWU  PANG,,(240) 481-2515,xpang@howard.edu,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,  ,

Over 370 million people worldwide are infected with the sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis each year. While treatable, delayed treatment can
have serious health problems, including infertility, disseminated infection, and pregnancy
complications. Since fewer than half of at-risk individuals are screened for these common STIs,
it is necessary to destigmatize STI testing and bring rapid point-of-care STI diagnostics to the
developed and especially to the developing world, where over 75% of STI cases are thought to
occur. Current nucleic acid-based STI tests offer optimal sensitivity and specificity but require
laboratory infrastructure (electricity, refrigeration, and trained laboratory technicians) that is
largely lacking where these STIs are most prevalent. These tests take days to return a result,
which can result in loss of patient to follow-up and treatment. In addition, these tests fail to track
the occurrence of antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea. With increases in azithromycin and
ciprofloxacin resistance, and more frequent reports of cephalosporin resistance, multidrug-
resistant gonorrhea could become a serious threat to global health, necessitating susceptibility
testing and antibiotic stewardship. In this SBIR project, GoDx, Inc. proposes to develop a rapid,
hand-held, low-cost, and sensitive point-of-care diagnostic to deliver rapid STI test results,
which would simplify screening and allow for immediate treatment at the initial visit. To develop
a rapid test for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis, we will focus on innovations to
integrate nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection to develop and test a prototype
device by the end of Phase II. Our easy-to-use sample preparation device would require fewer
than three user steps to purify nucleic acids for downstream detection. We will also reach
benchmarks for the sensitive and specific amplification of genetic markers in Neisseria
gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis using an isothermal
amplification technique followed by lateral flow detection. Our test will also amplify genetic
predictors of antibiotic susceptibility to aid in the tracking and treatment of antibiotic resistant
gonorrhea. Finally, we will integrate our assays into a test device delivering both STI and AMR
test results in 30 minutes, with performance on par with laboratory-based STI tests. Our
diagnostic tool will be simple and low-cost, making it ideal for use in the developing world where
laboratory infrastructure is lacking, affordable for better screening programs worldwide, and
easy enough for eventual in-home testing.Project Narrative
We are developing a rapid, low-cost, handheld, point-of-care diagnostic device for the detection of the three
most common, treatable sexually transmitted infections STI: chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis which
infect over 370 million people worldwide each year. With our rapid, easy-to-use test, healthcare providers and
patients can receive results in thirty minutes at the clinicians’ office, greatly simplifying and increasing STI
screening and treatment to prevent patient loss to follow-up, minimize spread, and reduce additional health
risks associated with STIs, such as birth complications, infertility, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Our test will
also include a rapid, molecular screening test for antibiotic susceptibility in Neisseria gonorrhea to aid in the
selection of proper treatment, monitor the occurrence of antibiotic resistance, and help curb the spread of
multi-drug resistant gonorrhea.",  ,,,,CHANGHEE  KIM,,(703) 969-1938,chkim7669@gmail.com,,  ,

Frequently, maintainers will remove the coating through a â€œracetrackâ€Â coating removal process that exposes each layer of the coating down to the layer to be repaired. This repair technique has proven to be effective; however, manual application of this process is both time-consuming and prone to manual errors. The Air Force desires an automated or semi-automated coating removal capability to increase the quality and speed of â€œracetrackâ€Â coating removal. Cybernet proposes to design and build a compact, portable Automated Coating Removal Tool (ACRT) for Air Force maintainers by leveraging our experience with designing and developing robotic systems. During Phase I, Cybernet demonstrated the ability to robotically remove these coatings, while using force sensing to detect the transition between layers to insure proper repair shape and eliminate damage to the substrate.",David M.

In diagnosis of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, and neurologic
disease, urine metabolites are increasingly being used to stratify patients for clinical trials. Many
of the metabolites are chiral with D- and L- enantiomers. These enantiomers are often produced
via different molecular pathways and can have significantly different biological functions.
Quantitation of chiral metabolites in biofluids (urine and blood) can be used as an in vitro
diagnostic and companion diagnostic to guide patient stratification and choice of a specific
therapeutic. Conventional POCs or analytical methods are limited because they only measure
single metabolites or single chiral metabolite at a given time. Measurement of multiple chiral
metabolites is challenging and expensive, often requires optimization of mass spectrometry
techniques and takes hours to days to complete. The limitations of the existing methods render
measurements of chiral metabolites impractical for speedy decisions needed for clinical trials or
patient care. New devices and technologies are urgently needed for a fast, accurate and
simultaneous measurement of multiple chiral metabolites. To this end, we propose to develop a
new point of care device which could rapidly and cost-effectively measure multiple chiral
metabolites with high sensitivity. Our innovation is the development of an integrated optofluidic
device with plasmonic metamaterials that greatly enhance detection of chirality and improve
sensitivity of measurement as much as 107-fold in andlt;10 ul of biofluids. In Phase I we will focus
on developing capabilities to filter and fractionate the biofluid and quantify the chiral molecules
from biofluids. This novel multiplex technology will enhance and rapidly perform chirality
identification and quantification in biofluids leading to significant cost saving and promote
precision medicine.Project Narrative:
Our point-of-care (POC) device will overcome the limitation of other conventional methods for
simultaneous determination of chiral metabolites in urine and blood. Our POC device will
facilitate rapid disease diagnosis, monitoring, and management, which could lead to rapid
medical decision making needed for adaptive clinical trials or patient care. It also can result in
significant savings of laboratory time and costs for facilities that implement POC testing.",  ,,,,LEILA  HEJAZI,,(858) 356-9258,hejazi.ld@gmail.com,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",  ,

The goal of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a system for the point-of-care (POC) detection of
Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) in human urine samples that integrates a patented detector of pathogens based on
identification of species-specific, nucleic acid (NA) sequences. The detector relies on a novel electromechanical
signal transduction mechanism that enables the low-cost, optics-free and amplification-free (e.g., no PCR)
detection of DNA/RNA at ultralow concentration (~10-19 M). A compelling need persists for rapid (minutes), cost
effective, POC NA detection devices for infectious disease diagnostics so as to facilitate prompt, well-informed
therapies and counseling and to avoid potentially harmful actions including the inappropriate prescription of
antibiotics. In earlier work, we demonstrated the detection of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), a CDC top-three
public health threat, with sensitivity of ~98% and specificity of ~100%. Chlamydia, the most common notifiable
disease in the US, is most often tested for in parallel with NG and is therefore the next most logical target for us
to address. A key feature of the patented detector is the use of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) capture probes, which
are uncharged polyamide analogs to NAs that share the same base chemistry. Since bead-PNA conjugates are
designed to be charge neutral, they do not exhibit electrophoretic movement in the presence of a DC electric
field. However, the substantial negative charge acquired upon capture of a target NA sequence makes the
hybridized conjugate mobile. Electrophoresis of the bead-PNA conjugate with hybridized target NA to the mouth
of a smaller diameter glass pore causes a significant increase in pore resistance, thereby resulting in a strong,
sustained drop in measured ionic current. Nonspecifically bound NA is removed from the bead conjugate in the
strong electric field in the pore mouth resulting in no sustained signal. Further, the opposing electroosmotic flow
through the glass pore sweeps PNA-bead conjugates without hybridized target away from the pore mouth. In
such a way, this simple conductometric device gives a highly selective (no observed false positives), binary
response signaling the presence or absence of the target NA (and associated pathogen). This project focuses
on two Aims: 1) Demonstration of the detection of CT in remnant urine samples from the UCLA Clinical
Microbiology Laboratory with competitively high sensitivity (≥95%) and specificity (≥95%) and 2) Development
and feasibility testing of key steps in an integrated and robust prototype device for rapid (andlt;5 mins) bacterial
detection based on the use of magnetic beads that minimizes the need for multiple chambers, pumps and valves.
Successful achievement of these Aims will result in a device concept ready for prototype development that is
capable of NG and CT testing with competitive accuracy and likely with significant advantages of cost, rapidity,
power and robustness. Further research and development work is envisioned to expand sampling capabilities
to other pathogens, both microbial and viral, and to other complex sample media including blood and sputum.Project Narrative
The goal of this project is to demonstrate feasibility of a system for the point-of-care detection of chlamydia in
human urine samples that integrates a patented detector of pathogens based on nucleic acid sequences. The
device addresses the projected $12.8B disease diagnostics market and is directed at the acute need for practical,
point-of-care diagnostic devices. Successful achievement of the specific project goals will constitute significant
progress toward a prototype microfluidic system for detection of gonorrhea and chlamydia in human urine.",  ,,,,SAM  BAE,,(657) 226-5977,sam.bae@enucleics.com,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES",  ,

The approach will focus on the development of blended tissue models for brain tissue to improve the modeling accuracy for neurosurgical simulators and injury biomechanics models used for human body injury assessment. The proposed effort seeks to characterize the transitional brain tissues of the meninges and cerebral vasculature, components which are often neglected in high-fidelity head finite element models but are critical to the isolation and stabilization of the brain within the skull. Investigation of additional transition areas within the brain which are commonly affected at the onset of brain injury (grey-white matter transition, myelin-axon interface, and microvasculature) will also be undertaken with the goal of developing multi-scale damage models able to simulate changes to the tissue nanostructure using conventional finite element methods. Corvid and IIT are uniquely positioned to efficiently accomplish the objectives of this proposal due to our previous efforts establishing X-ray diffraction (XRD) based methodologies for characterization of tissue transition dynamics, years of experience in modeling the human body response to external stimuli, advanced injury prediction capability using whole body finite element models, and in-house, high performance computing (HPC) resources and software development capabilities. X-ray diffraction scanning will be once again utilized to record the mechanical response across the brain tissue boundaries under load with minimal adverse effect or outside influence on the tissue specimen. Functionally graded mathematical models will be developed and validated for the brain tissue transition regions based upon the experimental results. Previous studies in the Orgel Lab have shown changes to the myelin X-ray diffraction patterns as a function of tissue damage. This information will be utilized to characterize and measure damage to brain tissue nanostructures with applied load, resulting in an experimental dataset to be used for multi-scale brain tissue damage modeling. The combination of novel XRD based experimental techniques and blended tissue modeling tools applied to the brain tissue transitions will result in a unique, high-fidelity finite element model of the brain which may help researchers in the field of neuroscience gain a more realistic understanding of the mechanical response and injury risk to the brain during surgical procedures or head impact events.",Hugh  Connacher,,,hugh.i.connacher.civ@mail.mil,Kevin  Lister,,(704) 799-6944,kevin.lister@corvidtec.com,,  ,

Chronic lung disease due to non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM-LD) is a silent and emerging epidemic in the
U.S. and many parts of the world.1-3 The incidence and prevalence of NTM-LD is increasing yearly and now
surpasses that of tuberculosis (TB) in the U.S.4 Two of the greatest known risk factors for NTM-LD are chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pre-existing bronchiectasis.3 In the U.S., approximately 12 million
individuals have COPD, and it is the third leading cause of death in the U.S.5 In addition, the co-occurrence of
bronchiectasis in patients with known COPD is estimated to be up to ~70%.6 Like TB, the requirement for
prolonged combination drug therapy is a central tenet of NTM treatment. Consequently, it is essential that
several drugs be administered concurrently to maximize sterilizing conditions. Unlike TB for which there are
now rapid molecular tests for detection of infection and antimicrobial resistance and recently approved new
drugs, diseases caused by NTM are a major concern for multiple reasons, foremost being their intrinsic
resistance to most existing antimicrobials in the absence of a rapid diagnostic test for antimicrobial
susceptibility or even NTM infection.7,8 Diagnosis of NTM-LD is complicated by the fact that clinical
manifestations and radiographic findings for TB and NTM-LD are virtually indistinguishable. Thus, it is
important when diagnosing NTM-LD to “rule out” TB even in regions of lower prevalence, such as the U.S.
because of its infectious and deadly nature. To differentiate TB from NTM-LD, clinicians must rely on a
combination of mycobacteriology and molecular tests to identify the etiological agent of the disease, which for
NTM includes 13 clinically-relevant species/sub-species that must be distinguished from approximately 180
other NTM species that are rarely pathogenic. In addition to the challenge of accurately speciating
mycobacteria, there is also the need to detect antibiotic resistance. Hence, the algorithm for mycobacterial
diagnostic testing is complex, requiring varied testing methodologies, which are either slow to respond
(culture), insensitive (smears), or insufficiently comprehensive (molecular).
Molecular detection of respiratory mycobacterial infections and resistance to antibiotics is challenging. The
specimen type (sputum) is viscous and highly heterogeneous; the mycobacteria bacilli are difficult to lyse; the
number of species is considerable; and the polymorphisms that confer drug resistance are numerous. To
address these challenges, we propose to automate and integrate the following into a one user-step test:
chaotic mixing of glass beads using a rotating magnetic disc to homogenize sputum and lyse bacilli, a porous
disc in a pipette tip to purify and concentrate nucleic acid, and a Lab-on-a-Film test to speciate and detect
polymorphisms that confer drug resistance. For Phase 1, we propose to develop a Lab-on-a-Film test that has
the required sensitivity to rule in/out TB, diagnose NTM-LD, and detect drug resistance when Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (MTB) and/or clinically important NTM are present.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Mycobacteria that cause respiratory infections, such as tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria lung
disease, require many months and tens of thousands of dollars for treatment. The diagnostic algorithm to
identify (or rule out) the organism that is the cause of the infection (and detect drug resistance), is complex

It uses ultra-low-cost storage media and can match the energy efficiency of lithium-ion technology. It stores energy by splitting CO2 into solid carbon and oxygen in a flow battery configuration, utilizing abundant materials and simple reaction chemistry. At <$1 per kWh capacity for the storage chemicals, it will provide long-duration (hours to days) storage at below $30 per kWh capacity, much lower than existing storage technologies. It will also offer more than double the energy density of lithium-ion batteries, enabling longer range electric vehicles. After a few years of materials R&D, Noon has demonstrated lab-scale proof-of-concept cycling for hundreds of cycles. Now in
the Cyclotron Road fellowship program at Berkeley Lab, Noon has designed and assembled the first bench-scale system prototype of this new storage technology, done initial modeling of the full system and carried out techno-economics analysis. The proposed ARPA-E project will enable Noon to further de-risk key system components, scale up to stack level demonstration of a next-stage prototype and to develop and integrate heat management, bringing us close to a full-scale product. If successful, this technology would provide unprecedented low-cost storage and make a major contribution to revolutionizing the energy sector with local clean energy from the sun.

The risk of death from hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmias is significant in the absence of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Rapid evacuation out of Iraq and Afghanistan ensured that most instances of hyperkalemia occurred further up the evacuation chain, thereby limiting the need for non-RRT hyperkalemia treatment options for austere conditions. to prepare for future theaters of operation, the military research community is preparing for prolonged field care and extended evacuation times by investigating treatments that can be deployed and utilized in resource limited environments. One implication of the delay is that complications of combat injury, including life-threatening hyperkalemia, will be more frequently managed in the far forward deployed setting where RRT is not practicable. To address this unmet medical need for the military, we are developing a forward care intra-abdominal mesh packing device to reduce systemic potassium levels in austere medical treatment environments to treat hyperkalemia. The benefits of our forward care medical device are three-fold: 1) stabilizes hyperkalemia patients to endure prolonged field care and delayed evacuation, 2) is logistically feasible to implement for field use requiring nominal dialysate fluid and medical training, and 3) expands hyperkalemia treatment options to include transport on aircraft with limited medical capability. This program will yield crucial advances with efforts focused on refinement and optimization of the device to ensure safe and effective treatmetn.

The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has recommended thatmajor wheat yield improvements must play a key role to ensure future global food security.Experts agree the most promising way to improve wheat yields is to capture the higher productivityand vigor associated with hybridity.Despite 60+ years of effort by the seed industry to develophybrid wheat as a commercial product all the U.S. wheat acreage is still planted to self-pollinatedvarieties. Failure to ensure timely and intended cross-pollinations renders production of hybrid®
wheat seed extremely inefficient and cost prohibitive. Our PowerPollen technology to preserve®
and apply viable pollen on-demand is changing this paradigm.Developing a PowerPollen systemfor wheat presents significant technical challenges due to the short life of pollen and feasibility ofcollecting sufficient pollen for on-demand pollinations. We are seeking to overcome theselimitations by developing novel technologies to extract large volumes of highly viable pollendirectly from anthers collected from excised wheat spikes. The goal of this Phase I SBIR projectis to prove the feasibility of developing a scalable technology for collecting large volumes of viablewheat pollen.This engineering achievement is essential to enable on-demand pollination andrevolutionize hybrid wheat seed production.The research objectives are: (1) Prove the feasibilityof designing/constructing a scalable method for mechanically harvesting male wheat spikescontaining mature viable pollen (2) Construct a scalable prototype to validate the concept ofseparating anthers containing viable pollen from green plant material and (3) Develop and provean efficient method of liberating viable pollen grains from intact wheat anthers for subsequentconditioning and storage.Anticipated Results and Potential Commercial Applications:®
Our preliminary data show that PowerPollen technology extends the viability of wheat pollendramatically.Pollen with the highest viability resides in anthers which can be isolated from theflowers mechanically.We anticipate the novel methods being evaluated in this Phase I projectwill provide sufficient volumes of viable wheat pollen to enable bulk storage and field-scaleevaluation of on-demand applications in Phase II.We have existing relationships with major seed®companies and have demonstrated the value of PowerPollen in maize under commercial fieldconditions.Our communications with leadership in the hybrid wheat industry and wheat breedersconfirm that current hybrid wheat production systems result in only about 40 to 50% seed set dueto inadequate pollinations.The cost to produce hybrid seed using cytoplasmic male sterility isabout $1000 per hectare; the cost is more than double that value using gametocide to inducesterility.A productive female inbred allowed to self-pollinate can produce 6 tons/hectare.If sowell-managed hybrid system requiring 35% male inbred achieving 50% seed set would yield about®
2 tons per hectare under favorable conditions. Assuming conservatively that a PowerPollenapplication can result in 75% seed set this would result in a 50% increase in hybrid seed yield to®
3 tons per hectare.At a COGS for hybrid wheat seed of $500/ton the value add for PowerPollenin this scenario is about $500 per hectare.A licensing/royalty fee that captures 25% of this valuewould equate to $125 of revenue per hectare.The value add would be more than double forgametocide-based systems and if the area allocated to male inbreds could be decreased. Using this®
model and projected market penetration we expect significant revenue for wheat PowerPollenwithin 5 years after completion of this Phase I project with revenues reaching $38MM for 10%marke",  ,,,,Jason  Cope,,(515) 360-3623,jason.cope@powerpollen.com,,  ,

A diagnosis of ovarian cancer (OvCa) is especially devastating. With 22,240 diagnoses in 2018 and an estimated
14,070 deaths, OvCa has the third-highest mortality rate, leading to the fifth-highest number of cancer deaths
among women in the United States. The objective of this research is to validate the anti-tumor function of
humanized antibodies with the end goal of identifying and developing an optimized lead monoclonal antibody
(mAb) as a therapeutic antibody against Epidermal Growth Factor-Like 6 (EGFL6), a mediator of tumor growth
and metastasis. Our first indication for treatment with the therapeutic antibody will be patients with platinum
resistant ovarian cancer (OvCa), post-PARP (poly-ADP ribose polymerase) inhibitor treatment, which is a
growing area of need. Our proposed therapeutic neutralizes EGFL6 by disrupting its functions to promote cancer
cell growth, act as a chemotactic factor in the tumor microenvironment to promote metastasis, and promote
angiogenesis. The proposed Phase I research objectives are focused on identifying the antibody most efficacious
in inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis for further characterization and development as a therapeutic antibody.
Upon successful completion of this Phase I study, the next steps in Phase II will include evaluating toxicity alone
as well as efficacy in combination with other OvCa therapeutics in order to address regulatory requirements and
refine concepts for clinical trials.NARRATIVE
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has concluded that special emphasis is needed to discover novel therapies for
high-grade serous cancer (HGSC), such as ovarian cancer (OvCa). However, the benefits of treatment with new
cancer drugs remain limited, even with renewed efforts. Our drug development goal is to develop therapeutic
monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to disrupt the functions of Epidermal Growth Factor-Like 6 (EGFL6), which has
been shown to play an important role in early through late stage ovarian cancer.",  ,,,,THADDEUS D ALLEN,,(415) 317-4818,thaddeusallen@tradewindbio.com,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,  ,

Natural killer (NK) cells are a subset of innate immune cells that are able to respond to threat without antibody
priming. This quick response to stimuli makes them an ideal immunotherapy candidate. Yet, genetic modification
in NK cells has proven to be difficult using conventional viral and non-viral transfection methodologies. Alternative
delivery methods are necessary in order to make genetic modifications at reproducible and efficient rates, while
maintaining high cell viability. The proposed study uses continuous flow electric field-assisted transfection via a
proprietary Flowfect™ platform. This platform represents a novel approach to non-viral delivery in historically
“hard-to-transfect” human cells. The current research proposes to transfect non-activated NK cells with Cas9
ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) for genetic modification using the Flowfect™ platform. To achieve this goal, we have
outlined a two-phase research strategy which focuses on stability and functionality of edited NK cells both in vitro
and in vivo. Phase I will focus on optimizing transfection efficiency and maintaining cell functionality while
Phase II will focus on understanding how the Flowfect™ platform would be deployed for pre-clinical Research
and Development purposes. Briefly, our Phase I goal is to 1) determine optimal Flowfect™ conditions in non-
activated NK cells and 2) induce stable knockout of a clinically relevant NK cell target. Meeting our Phase I
milestones will help us build towards our Phase II goals of 1) successfully screening guides which result in
enhanced cytotoxicity and 2) translating these findings to high efficacy within an in vivo mouse model of Acute
Myeloid Leukemia (AML).PROJECT NARRATIVE
Natural killer (NK) cells represent a high impact cellular target for gene therapy, but due to limitations in current
methodologies for gene delivery, NK cells remain a largely untapped resource. Here, we propose that non-viral
delivery via our Flowfect™ platform can alleviate this limitation on NK genetic modification at both research and
large scale needed for pre-clinical studies. Due to the major potential impact NK cells represent in the clinical
setting, non-viral Cas9 ribonucleoprotein gene knockout will allow for unrestricted therapeutic applications in viral
immunity, autoimmunity, and cancer immuno-surveillance.",  ,,,,PAULO A GARCIA,,(443) 799-3072,pgarcia@kytopen.com,,  ,

Driven by climate change and insecticide resistance this burden is expected togrow. Due to a lack of effective vaccines for mosquito-borne viruses integrated control ofmosquito populations remains the primary strategy for disease mitigation. Mosquito surveillance -monitoring an area to understand mosquito species composition abundance and spatial distribution- is critical to informing decisions about what control strategies will be most effective in specificlocations and is necessary to determine if interventions are effectively decreasing mosquitopopulations. Conventional surveillance practice relies on manual distribution of mosquito traps androutine visits to collect the specimens. Due to the resource-intensive nature of vector surveillancemany county and municipal departments of health particularly those in rural communities do nothave the capacity and capability to conduct routine surveillance. Here we propose to develop thefirst computer vision driven automated counting trap for mosquito surveillance. Building on priorwork to develop a computer vision system for automated mosquito species classification we willbuild an optical system for distinguishing between mosquitoes and non-mosquito arthropods. Imagerecognition techniques will focus on object detection in context of the new optical design andhardware specifications will be considered with the aim of transitioning development into a low-

Molluscum contagiosum (MC) is a highly contagious skin disease caused by the poxvirus, MCV. It
remains an Unmet Medical Need due to lack of an approved antiviral drug. MC appears as lesions on
the body and face that can last months-years before resolving. Lesions occur most frequently in children
(5%) and immune compromised individuals (5-18%). The infection is confined to the epidermal skin layers;
it is not systemic. Transmission spreads directly from person-person contact, autoinoculation or indirect
contact with fomites. Current treatments can be painful, cause scarring, and psychological distress. None of
the current treatments that include a range of physical, chemical and medicinal interventions are uniformly
accepted or FDA approved. The reason why no approved drug against MCV has been developed is
because the virus cannot be grown in tissue culture for testing. We have now made four major
breakthroughs: First, we have identified a protein target (mD4) of MCV that is essential for
replication. The mD4 protein functions as a processivity factor (PF) that tethers the viral Polymerase (Pol)
to the template to enable continuous synthesis of DNA. Second, we have constructed a mD4-
surrogate virus (mD4-VV), providing the first cell-based system for screening compounds against an
essential MCV target protein (mD4) in infected cells. Third, we have synthesized a small molecule
(7269) that that binds a precise region of the mD4 target protein, causing it to unfold and no longer
function. While 7269 can block infection by the surrogate virus, we were unable to improve its potency or
eliminate its slight toxicity despite an intense medicinal chemistry campaign. Fourth, we overcame this
impasse by conjugating a peptide to produce TriValine-7269 that binds the mD4 with a potency that is
6.3-fold greater than that of unconjugated 7269 and has no measurable toxicity. Since TriValine-7269
does not alter direct binding to the mD4 target, its increased potency is due to cellular penetration and/or
stability. The challenge that impedes further drug development is that TriValine-7269 has no related
analog of equal or greater potency to mitigate risk in the next stages of drug development. The GOAL is to
identify analogs of TriValine-7269 of equal or greater potency as essential backups. AIM 1 will utilize
medicinal chemistry to synthesize analogs of TriValine-7269. The focus will be to vary both the Peptide
and Linker portions of TriValine-7269. The 7269 portion will not be modified since it has already been
optimized. We will produce 30-40 analogs. AIM 2 will evaluate new analogs for antiviral potency against
the surrogate virus; cytotoxicity; blocking in vitro processive DNA synthesis; binding to the mD4 target.
AIM 3 will evaluate structurally distinct analogs for in vitro ADME activities that are relevant for topical
application including metabolic stability, solubility and cell permeability. Conjugates with criteria that
exceed or match TriValine-7269 will provide the minimum number of analogs for future drug development.NARRATIVE
Our goal is to develop the first approved drug for treating molluscum contagiosum
(MC), a viral skin disease that afflicts mainly children and immune compromised
individuals. This drug will be for topical use to specifically target the highly
contagious MC virus, which causes multiple lesions on the skin. The MC drug is
intended to alleviate the morbidity, physical suffering and psychological distress
experienced by millions of children and those with impaired immune systems.",  ,,,,ROBERT P RICCIARDI,,(484) 437-1660,ricciard@upenn.edu,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,  ,

The wind combined with solar power in a way that minimizes the footprint of the system is the most ideal for an efficient and resilient operations outpost. Large wind turbine systems require cranes and foundation materials that are not widely available in undeveloped countries and austere environments, as the cost to trench and run hard wire is time-consuming and expensive. Solar-only solutions are one-dimensional and have limited output hours. Additionally, unstable soil conditions constrain turbine construction opportunities. With fossil fuel generation, logistics are a major concern and fuel transport adds a layer of strategic liability that hinders the United States military. Small hybrid renewable solutions can mitigate these challenges. Primo Wind will provide resilient, clean, and low-maintenance power to military installations and expeditionary missions with logistical ease. Primo has over 200 units around the world to help save money and energy. The military sees microgrid development as a battlefield advantage for mitigating the risk of a grid attack. Primo Wind systems are an ideal solution for contributing to a strategic energy reserve that can be utilized in the event of a grid failure. The wind is critical to revolutionizing the movement towards the base of tomorrow.  With the smallest footprint of a combination of wind and solar power in a virtually mobile package. Primo Wind systems offer excellent power production at common Wind speeds.  Primo Wind’s patented 9 blade rotor meets the challenge that wind power is facing - how to produce usable power in wind speeds below 15 mph. This challenge is due to certain physical limitations of existing technology. Adding solar panels to our systems cuts down on the energy production intermittency typical of one-dimensional energy systems. The 1,200 Watt wind generator combined with two 200 Watts solar power-producing systems is the most efficient solution for keeping batteries charged (included energy storage), and in turn, available for rapid discharge and recharge.  Additionally, the whisper-quiet operation is an advantage over noisy diesel generators that can endanger the lives of Airmen by indicating their location.  ",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Nate  Kramer,,(301) 503-5653,nate@primoenergy.com,,  ,

In recent years, wind-sensing LiDARs have been developed that are able to sense wind conditions surrounding an aircraft out to several miles, but their large Size Weight and Power (SWAP) make them impractical for use on solar aircraft. A new wind sensing system is needed that can match the  performance of these LiDARs but with much lower SWAP.  Our research into this technology drove us to partner with Oklahoma State University’s (OSU) unmanned research institute (USRI) on the design of a new low-cost, low-SWAP wind LiDAR. This design can closely match the performance of a large LiDAR, but in a much smaller package suitable for use onboard a solar aircraft. We propose to develop this design into a working airborne-capable prototype, test the system in ground experiments, and perform flight tests.  The prototype LiDAR will be integrated onto the Skydweller solar-powered UAS in direct support of an ongoing Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) program and will be deployed to the SOUTHCOM theater to perform flight demonstrations. ",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Joel  Martin,,(405) 227-2044,joel.martin@skydweller.us,,  ,

In the nearly 20 years since the groundbreaking sequencing of the human genome, the potential for precision
genetic medicine has still not been realized. Advances in sequencing have vastly increased our ability to screen
patients (including parents and fetuses) for genetic abnormalities, dramatically expanding identification of
hereditary diseases in the prenatal period. This opens the door for fetal molecular therapies to address critical
genetic conditions in utero, preventing preterm pregnancy termination, newborn death, or irreversible tissue
damage resulting in life-long disabilities. The discovery of CRISPR systems and their remarkable ability to
perform precision gene editing quickly showed possibilities for clinical applications to treat genetic disorders.
However, clinical application of CRISPR is limited due to the introduction of mutations and DNA restructuring at
unintended off-target sites within the genome, which can lead to toxicity and cancer. Nowhere is this deficiency
more acute than in the application of CRISPR for in utero gene editing, where uncontrolled editing side effects
could affect the patient for the entirety of their lives. Controlling CRISPR gene editing is critical to ensure the
safety and efficacy of in utero gene therapies. Acrigen Biosciences is commercializing technology to bring
safe in vivo CRISPR-based gene editing therapies to the clinic. Acrigen utilizes anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins as
robust inhibitors of Cas nuclease, providing an off-switch for gene editing and preventing off-target effects. The
MacKenzie lab at UCSF specializes in fetal surgery and applying molecular therapies to correct neonatal genetic
diseases. The combination of controlled CRISPR gene editing with precise in utero delivery will allow us to
address previously untreatable genetic disorders, including hematopoietic disorders like alpha thalassemia and
neurologic diseases such as neuropathic Gaucher disease. We propose to develop a safe and effective in utero
CRISPR gene editing delivery system targeting hematopoietic stem cells and neurons in a fetal mouse model.
This Phase I STTR project has three aims. Aim 1: Design SaCas9 guides targeting a mouse reporter gene.
Milestone 1: Select guides showing andgt;70% editing in reporter mouse cell line. Aim 2: Construct a single vector
(Cas9-sgRNA-Acr) delivery system for controlled in utero editing. Milestone 2: Demonstrate maintained on-target
activity and andgt;90% reduction of off-target activity with an AAV compatible single vector system under Acr control.
Aim 3: Demonstrate safe and effective editing of a reporter mouse model in utero. Milestone 3: Show andgt;50% on-
target editing and andlt;5% off-target editing with AAV6 targeting hematopoietic stem cells and AAV9 targeting
neurons.Narrative
Combining precision fetal surgery with controlled gene editing will enable in utero correction of severe genetic
disorders. Acrigen Biosciences, Inc and the MacKenzie group at UCSF are developing technology to control
CRISPR gene editing and deliver precision genetic medicines directly to the developing fetus, enabling safe
and effective therapies for neonatal genetic diseases.",  ,,,,DAVID  RABUKA,,(619) 847-1193,david.rabuka@acrigen.com,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",  ,

This information is incredibly valuable, and has applications in healthcare, human performance and monitoring pandemics. Unfortunately, cybersecurity has not been a major focus for genetic researchers and companies, placing this sensitive data at risk for exfiltration or modification. The future of our bioeconomy, our healthcare and our pandemic response relies on these systems being secure, but challenges with lab device security can be difficult to address. Our research with Prof. Aaron Hansen on lab vulnerabilities indicated a widespread problem.  Addressing this problem without completely overhauling the lab infrastructure is nearly impossible, everything would need to be rebuilt from the ground up. However, GeneInfoSec offers a novel solution that protects genetic data even when insecure lab systems are used.  Our first pending patent offers a method by which segments of DNA from different samples are given unique and secure tags. After pooling these uniquely tagged samples with each other and with uniquely tagged decoy DNA molecules, genetic data produced by a sequencer is no longer identifiable and has necessary sensitive information concealed. Our second patent provides a way to manufacture these security tags for almost nothing, allowing for wide-spread adoption of our approach. All of these information systems will use our proprietary software to securely share and access the data.   Future tech development will include advanced molecular cryptographic methods, improving the obfuscation provided by the decoy molecules, eventually leading to molecular cryptographic systems that approach the security provided by full-disk encryption. Initially, the application of this technology will utilize traditional lab methods and lab technicians. As our company develops we will begin building bench-top automated machinery so that no expertise is required to apply our molecular cryptographic techniques. The data systems generated with our approach will also allow anonymous data sharing, which has great value in both genetic research as well as industry, allowing genetic data to be shared securely between institutions.  These approaches are desperately needed, as we are currently under increased cyber attacks focused on our health care and genetic data. Working with USAF stakeholders as early customers, we can build this technology to fit the needs of our service members, as their genetic data deserves the highest level of protection. We will also work towards price reduction and commercial availability because protecting the genetic information of the entire country is necessary to protect against biowarfare.",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Sterling  Sawaya,,(720) 404-5445,d@geneinfosec.com,,  ,

The increased survivability, however, has resulted in an increase of wounded warriors being sent home with severe injuries that ultimately reduce their quality of life post-treatment, especially those with severe damage to genitourinary tissues and organs. The catastrophic damage caused to the genitourinary (GU) system by these injuries extends well beyond physical impairment, drastically affecting the quality of life for wounded warriors. Often times, side effects include incontinence, sexual side effects, fertility, loss of reproductive capabilities, and hormonal problems, all of which can lead to psychological disorders that effect not only the wounded warrior, but also their families. New treatment methods are needed to preserve the function of the genitourinary system whenever possible. Towards these ends, TDA Research, Inc. has developed a novel perfusion system for the salvage and repair of trauma injured genitourinary tissue. It combines a novel perfusate which can oxygenate tissue without having to use blood (which has supply and type matching problems) and a portable, ruggedized, automated perfusion machine.

In comparison, silicon solar cells can achieve conversion efficiency of 20-25% at a cost of 1-3 dollars per watt. For solar cell technologies to be effective, it is essential to explore technologies that can deliver high efficiency power conversion without significantly increasing the payload or price. Recent studies at the University of Tulsa demonstrated that the performance of medium-grade silicon cells can be enhanced by 66% after applying a thin film of Halide Perovskite layers. If the same performance improvement can be achieved with the highest-grade silicon cells, then these lower-cost cells would reach performance levels only previously attainable with GaAs, but at 100X lower cost.

In an effort to increase mission capability, Kennon Products, Inc is proposing an affordable, compact, portable magnetic F-35 canopy cover to reduce canopy damage and be deployed with the aircraft. Fighter-class aircraft have limited storage volume on-aircraft, resulting in protective equipment often arriving on a cargo aircraft hours after the deployed F-35 has landed. This system is not only cost and time inefficient but exposes the F-35 to environmental conditions while waiting for its protective equipment to arrive. Kennon's canopy cover will be flight qualified so as to travel on the aircraft when deployed and can be quickly installed by one airman immediately after aircraft shutdown. Next-generation textiles and proprietary magnetic seals will prevent sand, dust, water, and prolonged incident solar radiation from damaging the canopy, and allow the protective equipment to remain installed even during 70mph sustained winds.  ",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Cameron  Ellis,,(307) 461-7525,cameron@kennoncovers.com,,  ,

An interesting approach to achieve this goal is to use laminated glass solar windows for both increased structural stability and protection, as well as for covert power generation. Luminescent solar concentrators (LSC) represent a specific kind of solar window technology that enables window-integrated sunlight harvesting for electricity generation, in which an adjustable portion of light absorbed by the window “tint” is shifted to a specific color and directed towards small solar cells attached at the edges of the glass. Inherently, laminated glass LSC solar windows combine the safety benefits of laminated glass with solar energy generation in a single autonomous device. When combined with an embedded battery, the window can provide a steady uninterrupted supply of power for any local need, or be optimized for putting the energy into the local power grid. In its simplest implementation, the LSC is comprised of two panes of glass sandwiching a fluorescent polymer interlayer, with attached solar cells covering the perimeter of the window. Up to now, this concept was mostly developed for use in commercial buildings with a goal of optimizing performance and aesthetics relative to cost, and the company is deploying the first projects now. For Air Force or other DoD users, new priorities besides aesthetics and cost will be considered. Working prototypes with certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to ~4% and sizes up to 4 ft x 4 ft have been manufactured and tested using stable and non-toxic CuInS2/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) in the nanocomposite interlayer. One example of how this might be tailored for the Air Force is that multi-interlayer laminates have been shown to increase performance (ACS Appl. Energy Mater. 2020, 3, 8159-8163), which is expected to also improve structural rigidity, similar to bullet proof glass. This is readily achievable at scale due to availability of thin glass, for example, from Corning (eg, Gorilla glass), however is not considered economically viable in commercial uses due to the added costs of high performance glass. Additionally, the QDs can enable a wide range of different colors that could be designed to make the technology hidden, or covert, potentially even camouflaged in the near-infrared portions of the spectrum where night vision is sensitive. Another possibility would be to focus on the electrical system and design it for a specific Air Force need, including active sound dampening or powering sensors on the window. There are numerous uses cases that the technology could be adapted for within the Air Force. This phase I project seeks to identify those needs and collaborate with potential users on the technology development and initial deployment.",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Hunter  McDaniel,,(505) 310-6767,HUNTER@UBIQD.COM,,  ,

These platforms are highly sensitive to wind and weather conditions and mission planners are required to operate them within tight requirements. Due to their slow airspeeds these platforms cannot adapt quickly to errors in the weather forecast, making them highly dependent on the accuracy of long-term weather forecasts for both mission utility and safety. Errors in weather forecasts can cause these platforms to be positioned poorly and unable to station keep underneath clouds or thunderstorms. Although it is effectively impossible to accurately predict weather out to 90 days, the possibility exists to create a forecasting system that can provide a spectrum of reasonable weather scenarios that have a high probability of capturing the true weather environment far into the future within a band of uncertainty. The Skydweller team proposes to build AI-driven five-dimensional (5D) weather forecasting tools that model weather across latitude, longitude, altitude, time, and uncertainty. The fifth dimension of uncertainty is a critical innovation for extreme-endurance platforms. This capability will allow mission planners to run flight simulations against all possible weather scenarios far into the future, within a forecasted range of uncertainty, and then adapt the flight plan of the air vehicle to maximize the probability of mission success and flight safety. ",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Joel  Martin,,(405) 227-2044,joel.martin@skydweller.us,,  ,

These technologies are a focus of the intelligence community (IC) because this challenge pertains to many intelligence problems, e.g., objects of interest are rare due to their use, sensitive nature, or context.  Published works artificially subsample a class to create a low-shot environment in training and retain the larger sample size for the test environment; however, how do we determine performance when only a few samples truly exist? The traditional cross-validation approach with training/test separation breaks down when only a few exemplars are available. This problem is further exacerbated by correlation amongst the example images (e.g., derived from the same location, time, relative aspect, etc.).  Furthermore, traditional approaches do not provide either performance estimates or an indication of uncertainty (especially relevant measures given the limited training data).  Without an understanding of the performance of such a system, it's impossible to abide by the DoD ethical principles of Artificial Intelligence. \n\n Our proposed Low-shot Transfer Performance Predictor (LowTraPP) first models the performance of well-sampled classes, a process that is agnostic to the underlying recognition system.  The resulting learned distributions then serve as priors for modeling low-shot classes' performance as a function of critical operating parameters.

Dynovas, in partnership with ExOne, is maturing the Field Optimized Advanced Manufacturing (FOAM) Pod under a parallel DLA SBIR Phase II. The FOAM pod is taking the facility to the warfighter, empowering the warfighter to control their own destiny, and enabling the on-demand manufacture of metal, plastic, and composite repair/replacement parts in 2-3 days. The pod is containerized manufacturing suite of part scanners, part form/fit/function databases, 3D printers, and production equipment (injection and compression molding) that limits the required training of the operators while maximizing the number of parts to which it is applicable. Parts can be produced that fit within a cubic foot volume out of the material most desirable for the application and can replace damaged, lost, or worn aluminum and/or stainless-steel parts on a strength basis, stiffness/weight basis, and strength/weight basis. While the FOAM Pod development SBIR is focusing on realizing an in-field repair part production facility, this program will begin qualifying parts produced by the system and the system itself through the standard Source Approval Request process. Components of interest on the published SBIR 20.3 parts list include the Sling Rail Adapter (FSC: 1005, NIIN: 015897062, and PN: RMFL-125) and the Wheel Hub Cap (FSC: 2530, NIIN 015521192, and PN: 12490289). The Sling Rail Adapter and Wheel Hubcap are in current use by infantry and M1 Abrams brigades, respectively, with annual demand quantities of ~12,000 and ~15,500, respectively. The high annual demand of both parts is enhanced by their simple, yet critical operational need. In general, approving the FOAM pod as an in-field source for repair parts for the warfighter eliminates costly and cumbersome inventory from being shipped around the world that may never be used, saving DLA and the various DoD departments millions of dollars in transport, storage, and oversight costs. The applicability of the FOAM pod is widespread and Dynovas intends to review the needs at the time of award to select the most critical components applicable to the system. After achieving source approval of the targeted components, Dynovas will initiate the large part portfolio approval request via “similarity” and overall approval qualification of the FOAM pod. Dynovas is a proposing a Phase I base program focusing on manufacturing aesthetically and geometrically acceptable components, a first option program focusing on testing, qualification, and final source approval of targeted components, and a second option program focusing on expanding the source approvals of the first option to parts by similarity and preparing the overall FOAM pod source approval plan.",Denise  Price,R&D Program Manager,(571) 767-0111,denise.price@dla.mil,Quinn  McAllister,,(508) 717-7494,quinn.mcallister@dynovas.com,,  ,

Most current designs of UASs either use a fixed wing approach or rotor lift configuration such as a quadcopter. However, these configurations are limited in terms of maneuverability and flight time severely placing restrictions on their applications and military uses. For example, missions envisioned for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) in urban environments require exceptional agility and involve flight through or in close proximity to buildings and require agile maneuvers with small turning radius. To meet these challenges, researchers have long been attracted by the amazing attributes of birds and insects. However, adequate control of flexible wing small UASs is required (and critical) in the performance of the mission requirements. In addition, flight time is severely limited for small UASs due to current battery technology. Moreover, recognizing that a successful small UAS will have to cope with uncertainties in its flight environment, the system must have an ability to adapt. In fact, with the observed real-world kinematics as a starting point, the system will literally have to learn to fly. To meet these needs, we propose to develop a new and revolutionary type of small UAS with intelligent control, highly agile, with nearly unlimited flight time able to operate in extreme conditions including heat and arctic cold, and highly contested environments with superior survivability. A final demonstration of the system is proposed in an urban winter setting that is highly congested in day and night and severe weather environments. The overall technology objective is to develop a UAS able to operate in highly congested/cluttered urban environments with nearly unlimited flight time under fully autonomous operations. The concept uses a flexible flapping-wing design along with a new type of navigation sensor, providing accurate navigation estimates in GPS-denied environments. In addition, the UAS is integrated with a revolutionary flight control system that is extremely robust and efficient, relying solely on system measurements. The control law is ideal for developing the required maneuverability for operations in urban and highly congested environments. Energy harvesting concepts are used to provide a system with almost unlimited flight time for increased mission effectiveness and outcomes. ",Major Jared  Evans,,() -,jared.evans@afwerx.af.mil,Kody  Viele,,(845) 423-9801,kviele@vielesolutions.com,Rochester Institute of Technology,Agamemnon  Crassidis,(716) 445-7811

Part of this will be ensuring that the aerodynamic forces and moments created when a hypersonic vehicle releases a store do not cause the store to have an unwanted trajectory (e.g., striking the launching vehicle). In order to accomplish this, extensive wind tunnel testing is needed. Spectral Energies (SE) and its partners at Florida State University (FSU) have developed a store release mechanism to reliably and repetitively launch stores in a hypersonic environment and used SE’s tracking software to capture the trajectory of the store. We propose to modify the mechanism to allow for high-volume testing that will allow for multiple stores to be released during a single wind tunnel run.

If a fast-acting motion sickness drug could be developed, personnel could wait and use the drug only if symptoms are present (i.e., as a rescue drug). A fast-acting motion sickness drug could revolutionize motion sickness treatment because the drug (and its corresponding side effects) would only need to be administered when actually needed on a just-in-time basis. The intranasal (IN) administration route is an attractive option because it can be very rapid and avoids using injections.

Advanced Water Testing Technology (AWTT) seeks to differentiate potable water supplies from non-potables sources while identifying specific sources of contamination.   The product would improve Installation Resilience during natural disasters to maintain water supplies during periods of utilities outage.  Wastewater Based Epidemiology (WBE) has always been a prevalent issue, yet has rapidly evolved throughout 2020 and into 2021. WBE is a useful approach to monitor biological outbreaks, specifically in compact areas. Individual testing methods are expensive, timely, and have the possibility for false positive and negative results. The primary method of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is through respiratory droplets in air, however, a significant number of inactive viral particles are available in the feces of people who are infected. The solution proposed to properly test for active viral strands is known as AWTT. The technology will eliminate the challenges of individual testing by providing an overall fraction of the positive cases present in a closed sewer system network. This is extremely beneficial, as AWTT can detect the virus in both symptomatic and asymptomatic people, even during the three to five day incubation period. Thus, AWTT can detect potential outbreaks before they become uncontrollable, keeping people safe and healthy during this time of crisis. From a technical standpoint. Right now, COVID-19 is the cause of the global pandemic, however, AWTT can be modified easily to be used in future instances with different viral strands to detect their outbreaks as well.

In an effort to minimize size, reduce weight, and increase load carrying capability, current bearing technology makes extensive use of carburized steels such as M50NiL or Pyrowear™ 675 for inner and outer rings and occasionally rolling elements. The carburizing process produces a hard, metallurgically graded microstructure from the surface down to the fracture tough core thus creating a residual stress profile that is advantageous to minimizing crack growth. Subsequent metal removal processing via grinding and honing produce a large near surface compressive residual stress which further prevents surface crack formation. The resultant residual stress profiles from the various manufacturing processes have a significant impact on the performance of bearings. Today, residual stress measurements are contractually required for each production lot of a bearing component (inner and outer rings) as part of the quality management process. This is a significant burden on bearing suppliers and can add upwards of 1-2 weeks on product delivery.

As the cost of launch continues to decrease, the frequency of launches increases with it.  However, the process, procedures, and technologies used for mission assurance has not kept pace. This proposal would provide the United States Space Force (USSF) with a much-needed solution to automate the pattern of life launch data for day of launch events.  The USSF needs a way to automatically assess if a launch sensor is within normal limits. Without automation,  it is impossible to keep up with the exponentially increasing number of sensors and the increasingly complex pattern of life behaviors.  The complexity of the task increases even further when one accounts for the growing number of launch providers.    The Department of Defense has accelerated continuous delivery through its DevSecOps journey, however, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML)  solutions are significantly lagging. Adoption of AI/ML capabilities is hindered by it’s lack of integration with common DoD DevSecOps reference architectures.  To incorporate AI/ML capabilities, the DoD must extend and mature the benefits of DevSecOps to include AI/ML tools and pipelines.  Platform One has built a DevSecOps compliant cyber security stack known as  “Big Bang”. Big Bang provides an Infrastructure as Code and Configuration as Code (IaC/CaC) platform that serves as the foundation for over 40+ weapon systems in the DoD. This foundation implements a scalable infrastructure platform that is ripe for expansion and maturation of capabilities. Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is one such capability.  Machine learning operations (MLOps) have, thus far, been mostly “demoware” and challenging to adopt across the DoD.  There are a few notable exceptions to this, but a significant barrier to adoption lies within the ability to accredit and certify a platform that enables the development of algorithms that can deploy to production environments.  The challenge is not in developing ML algorithms or finding/determining the right commercial tools to leverage.

Staphylococcus aureus causes skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) that result in 14.2 million outpatient visits
per year and 850,000 hospital admissions. S. aureus infection is not associated with the development of
immunity and, even with surgical and antibiotic therapy, recurrent infections occur frequently. Infections with
antibiotic-resistant S. aureus strains, designated MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) are associated with
poor disease outcomes and are now identified in 22% of hospital isolates. In order to address the public health
crisis of MRSA, we are developing a vaccine to prevent invasive S. aureus infections. Key features of S.
aureus disease are the pathogen’s resistance to opsonophagocytic killing (OPK) and the suppression of the
host’s adaptive immune responses. Staphylococcal binding to immunoglobulin (Ig) is mediated by
staphylococcal protein A (SpA), a surface protein that associates with the Fc-domain of IgG and the heavy
chain of VH3 clan IgG and IgM. While the former activity provides protection from antibodies that induce OPK,
the latter, through the crosslinking of IgM receptors, triggers proliferation and B cells and secretion of non-
protective VH3 antibodies, thereby disrupting adaptive immune responses and the development of protective
immunity. We have developed SpA*, a vaccine that elicits SpA-neutralizing antibodies that effectively promote
OPK of the pathogen while also allowing the host to generate many different pathogen specific antibodies that
together eliminate S. aureus colonization and reduce the risk of invasive disease. This phase I STTR proposal
aims to establish the feasibility of generating the SpA* vaccine by establishing its preclinical safety and
biological efficacy.Public Health Relevance Statement:
In the United States alone, there are 3.4 million cases per year of community-acquired Staphylocococcus
aureus invasive disease (skin and soft tissue infections [SSTI], skeletal, lung, and bloodstream infections) with
annual costs of $10 billion. There are 460,000 cases per year of hospital-acquired S. aureus disease (surgical
wound infections, ventilator associated pneumonia, bloodstream-, catheter- and device-associated infections)
with annual costs of $40 billion. A licensed vaccine that can prevent staphylococcal diseases or improve their
outcome is not available. Research developing immune therapeutics that prevent S. aureus disease and
improve the outcome of staphylococcal disease will have fundamental impact on human health and provide
exciting opportunities for commercial development.",  ,,,,DOMINIQUE M MISSIAKAS,,(773) 842-2627,dmissiak@bsd.uchicago.edu,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,  ,

Air Commons™ – Blue is designed to solve the integration of UTM, AAM, ATM and C-sUAS to provide ADA within a disaster response, main operating base or deployed forward operating base area of responsibility. The main components of the proposed Phase I effort will be the integration of Air Commons™ Deployable UTM with AERONet and ATAK working with the Civil Air Patrol’s (CAP) New York Wing (based out of Syracuse, NY) followed by integration of C-sUAS feeds in conjunction with USAF Security Forces from the 87th SFS (based out of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, NJ). Air Commons™ - Blue is designed to address four specific problems faced by USAF end-users: Deployable Unmanned Traffic Management: Unmanned Experts Inc. (UMEX) has completed RDT&E and flight trials on the NASA UTM program and developed Air Commons™, the only deployable unmanned traffic management system under USDA SBIR 2018-33610-28590 (Phase II). This mesh network architecture was designed for integrating unmanned and manned aircraft in the complex airspace over wildland fires and disaster response areas, with limited infrastructure and multi-agency aerial operations in force. Air Commons™ - Blue is a USAF end-user-oriented adaptation of the Air Commons™ architecture. Advanced Air Mobility Integration: Low level autonomous assets (‘Orbs’) operating in complex airspace require Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) or Orb-to-Orb (O2O) communications. A major component of the Air Commons™ program is an IEEE-sponsored V2V testing project additionally funded under AFWERX as the O2O research effort. Similar operating conditions to AAM will apply in the low level deployed and combat airspace environments, thus the Air Commons™ ADA capability being developed under Air Commons™ - Blue is an innovative, defense-related, dual-purpose technology. Networked Situational Awareness (SA): To develop SA or ADA the COTS C2 network known as Airborne Extensible Relay Over-Horizon Network, or AERONet, is a low-cost capability undergoing initial fielding with the USAF’s CAP. Another ADA system deployed is the Tactical Awareness Kit (TAK) or civilian version Android Team Awareness Kit (ATAK). This GOTS AFRL licensed software is becoming widely used in public safety and disaster response circles, to include with the CAP. Air Commons™ - Blue will integrate both AERONet and ATAK systems onto a deployable UTM platform and hence increase deployed and networked SA / ADA across the spectrum.

Graphene possesses ultra-high mechanical strength and high electrical conductivity, thereby limiting the anode expansion during charging and also improving the utilization of the semi-conductive silicon material. To address the key issue inhibiting widespread applications, the efficiency and cycle life of Si/SiO anode with higher capacity (> 600 mAh/g) is still unsatisfactory. Here, we introduce an effective way to further pre-lithiated graphene-silicon anode by investigating various methods (chemical/electrochemical/vapor deposition pre-lithiation on electrodes or active material powder). Therefore, additional lithium not only compensates first cycle capacity loss due to SEI (solid-electrolyte-interface) formation at the anode but also stabilizes cycling capacity degradation loss due to repeated SEI growth.

a safe and effective solution. Worldwide, over 1 billion women are impacted by POP, as it affects 33% to 50%
of all women. POP symptoms can have significant negative impacts on womenandapos;s physical, mental, and sexual
health, family relationships, daily living, and quality of life. Surgical options are the only available treatment for
severe POP. In the US, over 300,000 POP surgeries are performed annually for symptomatic POP repair and can
include the use of native tissue, synthetic meshes, and acellular biologic grafts (ABGs). Unfortunately, these
materials do not currently perform well. Over 40% of vaginal POP surgeries using native tissue fail within 2 years.
Synthetic meshes carry significant safety risks including chronic infection, nerve and tissue damage, and genital
tearing; these risks are so serious that the use of surgical mesh was recently banned in the US and several other
countries. Currently available ABGs have high recurrence rates and complications can include graft mechanical
failure, host-integration failure, and infection. Despite these issues, surgeons still support the use of current
commercially available ABGs for POP because ABGs have higher cure rates than surgical methods that use
native tissue.BioAesthetics is developing a transformative, polymer-strengthened ABG for use in POP surgeries
for women with severe POP. Our customer discovery identified mechanical strength as the key feature needed
for improving ABGs, thus, we developed patent-pending tissue engineering techniques for decellularization, to
make ABGs, and for polymer impregnation, which enhances the ABGandapos;s mechanical properties. Our strengthened
ABG simultaneously provides an allogeneic scaffold for patient-mediated tissue regeneration while countering the
onset of complications due to graft mechanical failure, improving the safety and efficacy of POP surgery. In this
Phase I project BioAesthetics is assessing the feasibility of this innovative product for use in POP corrective
surgeries by first focusing on determining the mechanical strength of our polymer-strengthened ABG both pre-
and post-implantation in a rodent model.Successful completion of this project will validate the feasibility of our product and generate proof-of-concept
data to serve as a foundation for future efforts. A subsequent Phase II project will focus on further developing the
product, expanding preclinical testing in additional large animal models of POP, and performing necessary
biocompatibility work for an FDA submission. Our ultimate goal is to develop a novel ABG that changes the
clinical paradigm for POP surgical repairs, resulting in improved outcomes and improved health and
quality of life for women with severe POP.NARRATIVE

Congenital heart disease (CHD) remains the most common category of birth defect and a leading cause of
childhood death in the developed world. Of the constellation of structural defects that comprise CHD,
dysfunctional pulmonary valves (PV) are a common abnormality, and frequently require surgical intervention
and replacement. Valve replacement through open heart surgery carries substantial risk and discomfort for
patients, and represents a major financial and emotional burden for families. The most commonly used valves
for pulmonary valve replacement in young children are biologically-derived (e.g. human cadaveric valves).
Such replacements are in short supply, and have other inherent disadvantages, such as poor long-term
durability, and propensity to induce a host immune response. The combination of these factors leads to a cycle
of repeat surgical interventions, using valves that are scarcely available and destined for rapid failure.
PolyVascular has sought to address these issues by developing a polymeric stent-mounted valve (SMV),
comprised of polymer-derived leaflets mounted within a metal stent, that can be delivered via minimally
invasive transcatheter techniques, avoiding the burden of repeat surgeries, with potential for improved
durability and function.
In the present SBIR Phase II application, we seek to expand this model by developing a broader series of
sizes, based on our existing platform design. This builds on data from our previous STTR Phase I proposal,
which demonstrated the feasibility of an “extra-small” (XS) sized SMV, suitable for use in very small children
with failing right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) conduits. By expanding this series to S, M, L, and XL, in the
present proposal, we can address even broader pediatric needs, such as eventual patient growth beyond the
usable range of an “XS” SMV, and concentric stent-in-stent deployment. Larger SMV sizes also have clear use
for other pediatric patients, such as teenagers with prior patch augmentation of the RVOT; this indication
requires a far larger diameters than the “XS” target range.
This proposal will focus on the necessary design and characterization steps to demonstrate the utility of the full
family of SMV sizes, and provide data to FDA for evaluation. Aim 1: Design expanded size SMV stents, and
assess just the metal stents for performance via ISO 25539 testing. Aim 2: Manufacture complete SMVs in the
expanded SMV sizes, and conduct necessary tests via ISO 5840-3 to document SMV performance and
durability. Aim 3: Biocompatibility testing and transfer a suitably-sized SMV to a GLP sheep model for acute
and extended evaluation of valve performance, calcification, thrombosis, and local tissue response.
These studies are intended to generate data that clarify overall SMV platform performance, and potential use
cases, and support first in human trials.",  ,,,,WILL  CLIFTON,,(832) 323-1843,will.clifton@polyvascular.com,,  ,

NDN is a new networking architecture. Unlike conventional TCP/IP based networking that is connection centric, NDN is data centeric and focuses on distribution of data content. The same named data packet cached in the network can be shared by many users, which greatly reduces network traffic loads. NDN also facilitates the use of opportuninistic network connections. Named data packets can be cached in communciation networks and be forwarded when network connection becomes available. It also has built-in security to each named data packet that ensures the data content is from an authentic source and can be accessed only by authorized users. These features make NDN suit the very well secured communciation needs in SATCOM networks where connection delay is relatively large and connections may be interrupted. In this project, a network environment emulation testbed will be developed for realistic emulation of various SATCOM network environments.

Proteins are the molecular machines of the cell that do all the work required to keep humans healthy, and incorporation of protein analysis is becoming increasingly important for developing a clear understanding of integrated biological systems, realizing the promise of precision medicine, and rapid drug discovery. Sample preparation is the first step in any protein-based project workflow and without a high-yield, fast, and reproducible way to prepare samples, downstream analyses are difficult to interpret and highly variable, leading to long project times and wasted resources. The proposed innovation improves sample yields, reproducibility, and speed, accelerating research seeking to discover new therapies and diagnostics and improving cost-effectiveness. It will also purify other important biomolecules from the same sample, such as DNA, RNA, and metabolites, allowing researchers to obtain more information from each sample, prepare multiple samples in the time it takes to prepare one, and improve reproducibility by using the same starting material. The proposed project will utilize reversible protein tagging chemistry to create a one-tube workflow for the capture, wash, and elution of protein samples for analysis. Because this novel reversible protein tagging chemistry is not dependent on a catalyst, does not produce byproducts, and is completely biorthogonal, it has the potential to work universally with all types of buffer systems, including harsh denaturants and detergents commonly used for cell lysis and protein solubilization. This proposed work will optimize the utilization of this sample preparation technology in the most used buffer systems, model organisms, and will show superior yields in the preparation of diagnostic sample types such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. Additionally, because our reversible protein tag does not cross react with other biomolecules, we will show that we can also use this technology to purify other important biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, and metabolites.

In particular, the size, weight, and power consumption (SWAP) of DEW components need to be significantly reduced, especially on airborne platforms. High energy laser weapons require a track illumination laser (TIL) for target identification and tracking (pre-engagement) and aimpoint maintenance (during engagement).  It has recently been shown that the thermal management of the TIL carries a SWAP burden which is similar to, or perhaps even higher than, the HEL itself, and a SWAP reduction is critically needed. The typical TIL is a pulsed laser operating in the 15xx-16xx nm wavelength band, and it relies on a three-stage laser architecture: 980 nm fiber-coupled pump diodes are used to pump Er/Yb co-doped fiber laser, which in turn pumps an Er-doped crystal (such as Er:YAG) solid state laser. This system is highly inefficient (~9% wallplug conversion efficiency) and very large. A simple solution exists: direct resonant pumping of the Er:YAG solid state laser with high power diode pumps operating in the 15xx nm wavelength band can enable a dramatic reduction in the size and weight of the TIL.  This approach can reduce the overall quantum defect from ~40% to ~7%.  This enables a dramatic increase in wallplug conversion efficiency (from 9% up to ~24%) which in turn reduces the cooling requirements by >3X.  After initial prototype demonstration, this program will support improving the manufacturability and reliability of these InP diode pump modules in order to accelerate the transition of DEW technologies to support the warfighter.",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Jenna  Campbell,,(805) 967-4900,jcampbell@freedomphotonics.com,,  ,

Peanut allergies affect a large population and can be extremely dangerous for those with the most severe forms. Given the ubiquity of peanut products, peanut allergy is a significant medical and legal concern worldwide, with a rising incidence of this potentially fatal condition in children. An allergen-free peanut developed from this project has the potential to significantly dampen the life-threatening reactions to peanuts, as well as the following benefits: (1) reducing the overall incidence of food allergy, (2) preserving human lives by eliminating anaphylaxis and death caused by accidental ingestion of peanut, (3) eliminating emotional distress of peanut allergic individuals and their families, (4) enhancing the public perception of peanuts as a health-promoting food, and (5) reducing the number of product recalls due to peanut contamination. The proposed project aims to develop and to commercialize an allergen-free peanut devoid of all clinically documented allergens using a genome-editing tool such as CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated system). Allergic reactions to peanut occur shortly after contact of peanut allergens with their specific IgE antibodies already bound to mast cells. The crosslinking of allergen specific IgE by the respective peanut allergens stimulates mast cells to release chemical mediators responsible for the clinical symptoms including sometime anaphylactic shock or death. Ara h 1, Ara h 2, Ara h 3 and Ara h 6 are the most clinically documented peanut allergens. The objectives of the project are: (1) Construct and validate vectors for Ara h gene editing, transform peanut embryogenic callus and regenerate T0 peanut plants; (2) Identify T0 individuals with deletions in Ara h genes; (3) Assemble lines carrying homozygous deletions in all target Ara h genes; (5) Characterize the selected lines for Ara h mRNA and protein expression; (6) Assess vegetative development of Arah-free lines under greenhouse conditions. If the resulting plants demonstrate tolerance to the gene deletions, the allergen-free peanut will be very significant in protecting the peanut sensitive populations and promoting peanut sales.

Hypertension causes 7.5 M deaths worldwide with no warning signs or symptoms and occurs in more than two
thirds of individuals over the age of 65. Hypertension represents a major risk factor for coronary heart problems
including ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, kidneys failure, and visual impairment. The most impactful action
against hypertension is represented by frequent blood pressure (BP) measurements, which assure early
intervention and its successful management. BP monitoring occurs mainly at the Health Care Provider’s (HCP)
office through cuff-based devices (e.g. sphygmomanometer) that can only accurately be operated by trained
personnel. Moreover, clinical BP measurement has the potential to cause Masked and White Coat Hypertension,
two well-known phenomena that prevent correct BP assessment and assignment of a proper therapeutic plan in
nearly 40% of the patients. Other alternatives are represented by ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and home
blood pressure measurement (HBPM) devices which have shown limitations due to costs, practicality, and
inaccuracy. Ovid BP proposes an innovative technology to allow comprehensive BP detection and management
via patented software that leverages today’s advanced smartphone camera technology to capture the
biomarkers required to determine a patients’ BP. The solution is empowered by an algorithm that estimates BP
from the heart’s QRS signal, which is specifically captured through analysis of the patients’ Vertical Head
Movement (VHM). Additionally, the rate of facial blood flow is observed through the well-understood practice of
video plethysmography (vPPG). With this data the system is capable of producing the Instantaneous Hearth
Rate Period (THRi) and Instantaneous Pulse Transit Time (PTTi), which are analyzed by a cloud-based algorithm
yielding systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as heart rate in a matter of moments. Ovid’s technology has
been tested in-vivo against clinical-grade HBPM devices and has exhibited a strong correlation to the reference
measurements obtained by the modern standard. In this Phase I application, Ovid BP will assess the feasibility
of the proposed approach to correctly detect BP when confronted with variables that might affect vPPG and QRS
estimation. Specific activities will include a study on selected human subjects to validate the technology against
a mercury sphygmomanometer and to investigate the role of age, sex, skin tone, and BP baseline as the cause
of errors. Data collected will be used to perform algorithm refinements required to solve any issues associated
with these variables. The conclusion of the proposed Phase I study will establish the feasibility of Ovid BP’s
video-based approach to measuring BP. During Phase II, Ovid will conduct a larger study to identify and solve
other key issues affecting the readings, including potential dermatological conditions that may impede the
accurate assessment of both VHM and PPG.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Hypertension is a “Silent Killer” that affects approximately 30% of the population of the United States and
accounts for 3.7% of the total disability-adjusted life years (DALYS) worldwide. Accurate diagnosis of
hypertension requires frequent Blood Pressure (BP) measurements, which are impractical or unreliable with
traditional methods. Ovid BP Systems has developed the first video-based BP monitoring system requiring only
the camera found in nearly every smartphone, tablet, or PC, allowing constant BP monitoring in support of prompt
diagnosis and intervention against hypertension.",  ,,,,CRAIG  WHITE,,(313) 492-8793,sbir@ovidbp.com,,  ,

Imagine fleets of UAVs flying programmatically inside every Air Force logistics depot to count inventory 10x faster, or UAVs with machine vision AI finishing aircraft inspections in hangars 10x earlier.    Outdoor UAVs with GPS are maturing. However, UAVs flown indoors still require human intervention in single missions & have only partial user-led autonomy. What’s missing is an AI system for large-scale indoor navigation & perception that’s persistent over full mission life-cycles, while needing minimal infrastructure changes for flexible installs. This allows UAVs stationed in facility interiors to fly repeatedly without human operator. This has the potential to advance the frontiers of UAV autonomy, opening up new use cases indoors for logistics, manufacturing inspections, & facility safety. Corvus has overcome critical technical challenges integrating low-level UAV controls, timing, & power systems, with high-level AI software for persistent mapping & navigation in a warehouse environment. This Phase I focuses on the enhancement of the AI software system to account for varying lighting conditions, facility layouts, and inventory types in USAF end-user facility environments.   In Phase I, we will visit the appropriate Air Force customer to understand end-user environments. We will demonstrate a UAV with AI autonomy software and charging dock, navigating indoors to detect objects of interest. The UAV’s AI software will complete missions fully autonomously indoors (no operator), including takeoff, return and land for recharge, and data transfer programmatically. It will not require Internet connection.    One possible outcome we foresee is, if selected for Phases II or III, we will integrate our AI-led UAV onto one or more Air Force base warehouses or hangars.

Immunotherapeutics, which work by engaging the immune system to tackle diseases, have demonstrated tremendous potential to cure, or improve quality-of-life of patients with cancer, autoimmunity, or other disorders. Unfortunately, only a handful of these treatments are currently available. Furthermore, immunotherapeutics are costly and unaffordable for the healthcare system and patients including the disadvantaged populations. These challenges can be attributed to the costly and inefficient therapeutic discovery processes with conventional drug screening platforms. This project aims to develop a high-throughput, single-cell based functional screening technology that can enable rapid discovery of many immunotherapeutics, specifically bispecific antibodies (“BsAbs”), to treat a broad range of debilitating diseases, and therefore can make significant and broad societal impact. Meanwhile, the BsAb market is in its early exponential growth phase and will reach $10 billion global sales in the next few years. The proposed technology will be quickly deployed to enable pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients to identify their therapeutic leads with unprecedentedly rapid turnaround and high success rate (commercial value). The proposed project aims to further develop, optimize and launch the first dedicated commercial platform for functional discovery of bispecific antibodies (“BsAbs”). The conventional trial-and-error approach, in which BsAbs are empirically designed and then must be evaluated individually for their functionality, is tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. The proposed technology represents a new paradigm in BsAb discovery by employing an ultra-high throughput, single cell-based functional screening, enabling efficient discovery of rare functional BsAbs with differentiable properties. The objectives of this project are to develop, optimize and quality control (QC) the entire platform workflow including upstream BsAb library and reporter cell preparations, midstream droplet assay and sorting, and downstream target validation and characterization. By the conclusion of this study, a robust and streamlined system will be ready for commercial launch, enabling pharmaceutical company partners to discover new BsAb immunotherapeutics. This project will result in new tools and methods in single-cell therapeutic discovery and make significant intellectual contributions including complex cell library construction, multiplexed reporters, and potentially new therapeutic candidates. Furthermore, the unique ability to interrogate many variables in a combinatory and high throughput fashion can lead to new insights of the modes of action and inform future design of immunotherapeutics.

It uses ML to find patterns in a corpus of training data consisting of thousands of IoT files and builds Codebooks consisting of patterns and associated indices/Codewords; when identical Codebooks are installed in the source and destination, they can communicate in Codewords, rather than ever sending the original data. Codebooks can be built and updated entirely autonomously. Typical compaction achieved is 70%+ reduced compared to the size of the original data. Numerous ancillary advantages of AtomBeam’s technology benefit users. Because the heavy computing is done in advance, processing live data consists only of a lookup and is very light and fast, up to 400x the speed of compression. With far less data to send due to compaction, effective speed of transmission is increased dramatically, as well as expanding available bandwidth. Users experience improved IoT battery life resulting from reduced time on air, and improved security due to obscuring the data through translation of the original data to Codewords, which can be further secured by encryption of the Codewords and additional proprietary techniques. Range is lengthened up to 2x due to freeing up bandwidth for added, more efficient error correction, and the flow of AtomBeam-encoded data corrects itself, making it more resistant to interference. In development is a feature that will allow users to search and randomly access stored, encoded/compacted data in the same manner as original data. The software can be provisioned in the stack of new or existing machines as a software/firmware update; the executable is less than 2000 bytes and Codebooks vary in size from 350 bytes to several MB. The technology is fully operational, can be demonstrated with a demo on an AWS instance and with an SDK can be installed in a user environment. The applications of this technology for the AF have very broad potential, including basically in any data communications, such as from aircraft, missiles, UAVs, ground control, satellite data and much else. While it is not usually applicable to data that has been compressed, such as video and images that provide little opportunity to find the patterns needed to generate efficient Codebooks, for the vast majority of telemetry type data AtomBeam has the potential to significantly enhance and speed data communications. Using only software, AtomBeam has the effect of increasing bandwidth to the same degree as much more expensive hardware network upgrades, while providing added benefits to warfighters beyond increasing the speed of data flow. AtomBeam’s CEO, Charles Yeomans, was a Naval Intelligence officer prior to business school, and has a strong appreciation for the potential value of the technology to DoD.",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,James  Frandeen,,(831) 359-5310,jim.frandeen@atombeamtech.com,,  ,

The Problem: Despite current therapies, the prognosis of various forms of acute and chronic inflammation
of the heart (myocarditis) remains poor. Immune reactions that attack a patient’s own tissues (autoimmune
disease) is one major cause of myocarditis. Additionally, one of the complications of immune checkpoint
inhibitors (ICI), which attack cancer cells though activation of inflammation, is myocarditis.
Innovation:
Inflammation involves multiple molecules and multiple redundant pathways. The anti-inflammatory monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) forming the basis of treatment of inflammation-related diseases target a single molecule and
a single inflammatory pathway. Therapeutic efficacy is thereby limited. NK cells are major orchestrators of
multiple inflammatory pathways. Inflamma Therapeutics (IFT) therefore developed a novel mAb—IFT100—that
depletes NK cells. By inhibiting NK cells IFT100 inhibits multiple inflammatory pathways.
As proof-of-concept of the efficacy of an NK cell depleting strategy, we demonstrated that an anti-NK cell mAb
that depletes mouse NK cells improves myocardial function in mice with acute heart attacks or with chronic
heart failure. IFT therefore decided to develop an anti-human NK cell mAb—IFT100—to serve as an
immunosuppressive therapeutic agent to treat inflammation-exacerbated human disease. IFT found that IFT
101 binds to and depletes human NK cells. IFT100 was sequenced and patents submitted.
The AIMS of the current proposal, using IFT100:
Aim 1: Determine the dose response for in-vivo NK cell depletion in mice.
Aim 2: Determine the impact of NK cell depletion on the prevention of Experimental Autoimmune Myocarditis.
Aim 3: Determine the impact of NK cell depletion on the prevention of Experimental Autoimmune Myocarditis
with or without the burden of ICI treatment.
Aim 4: Humanize our mAb.
In this project we will be validating the ability of our specific mAb (IFT100) to improve autoimmune-induced and
ICI-induced myocarditis. Importantly, however, we believe IFT100 will also be effective for improving
outcomes in many other diseases that are worsened by excessive inflammation. These include
myocardial dysfunction in patients with chronic heart failure, with cardiogenic shock, and with acute MI.
Another important additional therapeutic target for IFT100 is the massive inflammatory response responsible
for most of the deaths seen in Covid-19. Each of these conditions has no current effective therapy and, as
such, constitute conditions for which there are major unmet therapeutic needs.Narrative
Severe forms of inflammation-induced acute and chronic myocarditis caused by autoimmune disease
or occurring as a complication of checkpoint inhibitor therapy for cancer patients have a poor prognosis, even
with available therapies.
Stimulated by the knowledge that inflammation involves multiple pathways, and that inhibition of a single
pathway (as current monoclonal antibodies do) is intrinsically limited in efficacy, Inflamma
Therapeutics developed a novel mAb that inhibits NK cells, one of the major orchestrators of multiple
inflammatory pathways.
By inhibiting NK cells, we inhibit multiple inflammatory pathways, a more potent therapeutic strategy for
improving outcomes not only for myocarditis, but in many other diseases that are worsened by excessive
inflammation.",  ,,,,DROR  LUGER,,(301) 717-1816,luger.dror@gmail.com,,  ,

This linear accelerometer measures the acceleration of the RV and this data is used to accurately predict the distance that the RV has traveled. This system is required to maintain a high degree of accuracy while being subjected to a combination of high acceleration, shocks, vibrations, and electromagnetic radiation due to nuclear detonations. Finally, the package is expected to have a 20-to-30-year long maintenance free lifespan. The accelerometer design currently used for strategic missiles has not been significantly redesigned for several decades. Over this time, technology advancements in MEMS and piezoelectric accelerometers have resulted in significant improvements in performance while minimizing size and cost. MEMS accelerometer designs based on Silicone Resonant concepts show great promise for the PLM application. One new MEMS sensor that has recently gone into production from MEI is a 6-degree-of-freedome (6-DOF) inertial measurement unit sensor. The currently available package comes in +/-40g sensitivity, responds from DC to 3 kHz, is rated for mg resolution, and can survive 10,000g shocks. The MEI package, which comes on a single 7-mm chip, is a combination of a 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyro. The gyro is simply a system of four 3-axis accelerometers with a smaller test mass which can be repurposed as additional accelerometers. The gyro accelerometers in the commercial package operate at +/-500g and have a 10 kHz bandwidth, thus extending the dynamic range of the base device. Furthermore, MEI can manufacture custom packages based off of the current design. For example, each of the four gyro accelerometers could be modified to operate over a specific range of acceleration or frequencies. This will allow specific operating parameters to be addressed with a custom chip design in the Phase II program. The custom MEI accelerometer could be combined with strategic radiation hardened electronics and packaged in a radiation hardened shell to form the basis of a new PLM. The design solution must be able to survive mechanical shock loads, system generated electromagnetic pulse (SGEMP) and radiation environments while delivering reliable and accurate measurements of exceedingly small accelerations. The availability of a PLM with sufficient accuracy built from off-the-shelf components would represent a significant risk mitigation and cost savings to MK21A and future ICBM programs.",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Thomas  Rasmussen,,(937) 829-3139,trasmussen@innssi.com,,  ,

and the invasiveness of biopsy introduces a delay into NMSC detection, which contributes to
patient morbidity and adds substantial cost to the healthcare system. EnSpectra Health, Inc
(Enspectra) aims to address the unmet clinical need for a better method to detect NMSCs
earlier. This Phase IIB application builds on the progress of awarded Phase I and Phase II
projects (NCI, 2R44CA221591-02A1). In Phase I of this grant, EnSpectra demonstrated the
feasibility of a portable, skin-imaging microscope for human clinical studies (Aim 1), developed
software for data acquisition, image processing, and improved user interface (Aim 2), and
demonstrated in 5 human subjects with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) the ability to detect
pathologic features of BCC (Aim 3). EnSpectra has created the first fiber coupled multiphoton
microscopy (MPM) system for in vivo imaging of skin cellular anatomy. In Phase II of this grant,
EnSpectra advanced the development of its portable, skin-imaging microscope (Aim 1),
developed a library of slide images of targeted skin diseases comparing MPM to traditional
histology (Aim 2), and is on track to complete in vivo human performance testing (Aim 3) prior
to the Phase II end date. The completion of the Phase II aims will enable EnSpectra to build
clinical evidence in to support a 510(k) submission for United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) clearance. In this Phase IIB proposal EnSpectra will accomplish two
aims: Aim 1) Develop and manufacture 8 portable, skin-imaging microscopes for commercial

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inheritable form of cognitive impairment and the leading known
genetic cause of autism. FXS is caused by the loss of expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein
(FMRP). A major challenge for FXS research is to develop treatment strategies that improve the intellectual
capabilities of patients. Dysregulated protein synthesis is widely accepted as a core molecular abnormality
associated with FXS. Because neuronal protein synthesis is critical for learning and memory, altered synaptic
translation is considered a major contributor to the intellectual deficits seen in FXS. Currently available
pharmacological intervention strategies for FXS primarily treat behavioral problems and have focused largely on
targets upstream of translational control to normalize FXS-related phenotypes. We have identified a specific
target that is a common downstream effector of both mTORC1 and ERK signaling and plays a direct role in
regulating translation. Genetic deletion of the target in an animal model of FXS corrected exaggerated protein
synthesis and other biochemical, neuroanatomical and behavioral abnormalities associated with FXS. These
results suggest a strategy for developing a disease modifying therapeutic for FXS. By using a rational design
approach that combines structural protein information and optimal ADME properties, we have discovered a novel
series of potent inhibitors. Epigen has developed specific and drug-like small molecule inhibitors to this target,
as exemplified by lead compound EPGN1370. Lead optimization efforts in the phase 1 STTR portion of the work
identified EPGN2036 as a candidate for pharmacological evaluation. This compound dose-dependently
corrected behavioral deficits in FMR1 KO2 mice after oral administration. Moreover, EPGN2036 demonstrated
target engagement in hippocampal lysates of FMR1 KO mice treated with the compound. In collaboration with
Dr. Alysson Muotri at UCSD, we have started development of brain organoids derived from FXS patients to
model the disease in 3D in the laboratory. Preliminary safety studies in rats indicate that EPGN2036 has sufficient
safety margin to warrant further investigation. The goal of this phase 2 SBIR work is to characterize the preclinical
efficacy of EPGN2036 using a translatable biomarker of drug efficacy, evaluate drug-drug interaction potential
of leads, conduct focused back-up / follow-up discovery and assess safety of select leads to determine
development potential. Recent work demonstrated that EEG measures in FMR1 KO mice are in excellent
agreement with EEG signals of FXS patients and that EEG could be used as a biomarker predictive of early
disease modulation. As such, we will evaluate the effect of EPGN2036 on both mouse FMR1 KO mouse EEG
and FXS brain organoids. At the end of the grant period, we expect to be in a position to select a development
candidate for initiation of IND-enabling studies and progression to phase 1 clinical trials in humans for
assessment of safety and tolerability of EPGN2036 in normal healthy volunteers.",  ,,,,FABIO C TUCCI,,(619) 917-0639,ftepigen@gmail.com,,  ,

These sensors can be used for qualification of Additive Manufacturing (AM) components during printing and subsequently for other functions during the lifetime of AM components. The NJ technology is a unique print technology with a print nozzle standoff distance from the print surface of 2-6mm. This standoff distance is advantageous over other printing technologies and enabling for the NJ technology for printing over nonplanar surfaces or into cavities. The NJ technology has several other unique attributes making it ideal for printing embedded features layer-by-layer in conjunction with structural 3D printing processes. Recent results show that printed conductive Ag traces are cured in-situ during printing. A second print cartridge included in the two-material NJ print head allows printing of dielectrics above and beneath cured NJ printed conductors fully encapsulating conductors. UV curing dielectric material makes it possible to immediately 3D print over the NJ printed features to embed those printed features within the 3D printed structure.

Often, these scenarios are dangerous, expensive, and complex to simulate in the real world. When they occur, they require rapid response with limited margin for error.

The 147th Attack Wing expressed a need for this type of product for general firefighter training and specific events, including an F-16 shut down procedure. Current F-16 firefighter training utilizes text documents and schematics, and rarely allows for interaction with an actual F-16 asset, as that requires taking the aircraft out of service. Low-frequency training decreases knowledge retention, and increases the likelihood that a firefighter will respond to an event without having interacted with the specific asset.

In particular, NASA’s SSBM provides poor fits to mass distributions and area/mass ratios (AMR) for low-velocity impacts as expected at GEO/GTO altitudes. GEO/GEO and GEO/GTO collisions are assumed to occur at an upper limit of 800 m/s or 1.5 km/s respectively, although recent analysis using USSTRATCOM’s Conjunction Data Messages (CDMs) has indicated that collisions up to 3.2 km/s are also possible. Additionally, the NASA standard breakup model is tailored for generic bodies without evaluating dependencies such as material or unique geometry considerations. Corvid, in partnership with Spectral Sciences (SSI) and Cloudstone Innovations, will leverage high-fidelity first principles hydro-structural codes and post-processing tools for enhanced space debris trajectory prediction, with a particular emphasis on GEO. This high-fidelity debris fragmentation characterization will supplement legacy analytical breakup models used in current conjunction analysis tools for increased fidelity in conjunction risk assessments. Corvid’s approach will adapt their existing post intercept debris (PID) toolsets currently used across the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to integrate high fidelity debris databases into the existing conjunction analysis tools. Corvid’s high-fidelity hydro-structural solver Velodyne will be used to generate debris databases of the extensive engagement space associated with satellite conjunction events. In order to cover this engagement space, Corvid will adapt          its Virtual Environment for Realistic Interceptor and Threat Analysis and Simulation (VeritasTM) simulation framework. VeritasTM supports interpolation between multiple VelodyneTM simulations within a larger PID database covering the relevant engagement phase space.

The USAF seeks to do this with a transformative 3D scanning system. This system must be capable of reverse engineering and 3D printing obsolete and current parts and/or components of aircraft and other assets. Quidient’s 3D scanning software solution meets this need with its unique approach to generating highly accurate 3D digital models. Quidient proposes to supply a 3D scanning software solution that will transform smartphones into Highly-Capable 3D scanners for Reverse Engineering. The goal is to alleviate the issue of reverse engineering obsolete and complex parts while creating a new 'Gold Standard' in 3D scanning and printing.  The core deliverable associated with this SBIR is software (the Software) that transforms smartphones into highly-capable 3D Scanners for Reverse Engineering (the Systems). The Software includes a 3D scanning application (the App) that is enabled by the Quidient Reality™ Generalized Scene Reconstruction (GSR) software platform (the Platform). The GSR Platform utilizes cutting edge innovations in 5D scene reconstruction (reconstructing the 3D matter field, including its geometry and materiality + 2D light flow) to create digital models of parts. By “highly-capable” we mean having attributes including high accuracy, completeness and ease-of-use. The App generates digital twin models that are accurate enough to reverse engineer materials of interest to the USAF. The App, when coupled with onsite 3D printing technologies, will support USAF additive manufacturing capabilities in maintenance depots, FOBs, and more. The Platform can run on standard mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets) in the field. The novel 5D approach to scene reconstruction is a key feature of the platform that will enables hundreds, if not thousands of applications requiring robust scene scanning and modeling.",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Scott  Ackerson,,(484) 888-2379,scott@quidient.com,,  ,

subtypes of cells, as well as changes within specific subtypes resulting from diseases or treatments. However,
most current methods require dedicated hardware and kits, making them expensive, and most are 3’ based and
thus cannot measure splice variants, gene fusions, expressed single nucleotide variants, or RNAs that are not
polyadenylated. Furthermore, there is no method to-date that enables investigators to measure low or even many
moderately expressed genes from single cells, which prevents measurements of many key biomarkers and
important genes in molecular pathways and functions. Current methods also only measure a limited number of
genes/cell and do not provide quantitative measurements of the abundance of those genes, and thus cannot be
used to measure changes in expression level along the order of magnitude possible using bulk preparations of
cells, nor can they be used to carry out dose response experiments at the single cell level. Our approach will
enable investigators to carry out single cell assays without purchase of proprietary hardware, and provide a level
of performance comparable to the profiling of bulk cell samples. Based on the commercial targeted gene
expression TempO-Seq® bulk cell assay, we will implement a TempO-LINC single cell assay which, based on
preliminary data, will provide data measuring the same genes (low, moderate, high expressed) and similar
number of genes/cell as can be measured from bulk samples, quantitatively, providing a similar dynamic
expression range and normal distribution of counts as measured from bulk samples. TempO-LINC can be used
to process a few 100 single cells up to 100,000+ cells at a time. TempO-LINC data will be benchmarked against
both bulk cell data and 10x Genomics single cell data. Furthermore, we will demonstrate utility to measure splice
variants and to provide single cell dose response data. These data will be generated using the commercial S1500
surrogate whole transcriptome assay adapted to the TempO-LINC process. In a follow-on Phase II program, the
human and mouse whole transcriptome assays will be implemented, the TempO-LINC assay commercialized,
and additional applications demonstrated using cell lines, purified cells, and cells dissociated from tissues. The
performance and capabilities of the TempO-LINC single cell assay will drive expansion of applications pursued
within the single cell field beyond identification of subpopulations of cells.Project Narrative
Singe cell gene expression assays have become important tools to identify functional subtypes of cells and
changes in the numbers of cells within each subtype, or of subtypes, resulting from disease and treatments.
However, current methods require dedicated hardware and kits, making them expensive, and do not permit low
expressed genes that may be key biomarkers to be measured, typically only measuring a limited number of
genes/cell, typically not providing quantitative measurements of abundance or changes in expression level, and
are often 3’ based and so cannot measure splice variants or RNA such as long non-coding RNA that are not
polyadenylated. We will demonstrate the feasibility of a novel TempO-LINC assay using a barcoding approach
that does not require proprietary hardware, and demonstrate that this assay provides single cell data that
measures the low and moderately expressed genes identified from bulk samples, is highly correlated to bulk cell
benchmark assay data with respect to the number of genes/cell, represents the dynamic expression range of
those genes within each cell, and can provide single cell dose response data - enabling single cell studies not
previously possible to understand (e.g.) molecular mechanistic differences at the single cell level of disease, and
drug efficacy and safety.",  ,,,,BRUCE E SELIGMANN,,(760) 476-1800,bseligmann@biospyder.com,,  ,

D. Smith, Air Force Research Laboratory, et al. paper ""Multi-Axis Vibration Mitigation Properties Of Seat Cushions During Military Propeller Aircraft Operational Exposures"", vibrations are negatively impacting military aviators. For crew members of rotary-wing and fixed-wing propeller aircraft, back pain has been documented extensively.  More recently, increasing reports of annoyance, fatigue, and even symptoms of back pain have received more serious attention in propeller aircraft. These symptoms have been associated with increased aircraft vibration and exposure to longer missions associated with current international affairs. Ms. Smith cites the U.S. Navy E-2C Hawkeye, a carrier-based early warning command and control platform. The Navy surveyed 185 E-2C aviators including 42% Pilots/Copilots and 58% Navy Flight Officers or NFOs. The results indicated that 80% of the respondents had experienced neck and/or back pain in a one-year period. Most reported pain lasting at least one to two days. For those reporting pain, 35% to 40% of those reporting pain considered the symptoms a limiting factor in job performance.  Corsair Innovations is developing Fiber Energy Absorbing Material (FEAM), a radically new and improved energy impact technology. FEAM could be used to attenuate vibration energy to reduce harmful effects from Whole Body Vibration.  It uses nylon monofibers called flock fibers as leaf springs.  Impact and vibration energy response can be easily and specifically tuned by changing the fiber radius to fiber length ratio.  A UMass grad student measured Tan Delta of FEAM vs. Sorbothane and FEAM compared favorably. Corsair received two NFL grants to develop FEAM as an anti-concussion material.  FEAM protects against injury from impact energy in helmets and body pads. Corsair will build a variety of FEAM panels with different cushioning factors by varying the rand have Advanced Materials and Development (AMAD) test them for vibration.  Cushioning will be engineered by varying the ratio of the flock fiber length/radius. In mechanical engineering, this is the Slender or Slenderness ratio. Longer, thinner fibers produce a more soft cushion and shorter, wider fibers provide a stiffer, springier feel.",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,William  Lyndon,,(781) 733-9267,wlyndon@corsairinnovations.com,,  ,

demographics, affecting 202M people worldwide and 18M in the USA, with an annual growth rate of 6.8%.
Approximately one-third of PAD patients experience lower extremity pain that limits activity, and one-third of
these patients suffer from critical limb ischemia (CLI), which lacks any effective treatment option and is
associated with devastating complications including resting pain, skin ulcers, and gangrene, with 30% of
patients requiring amputation and a mortality rate of 25% within 1 year post diagnosis. Invasive surgical or
catheter-based treatments are ineffective in CLI and associated with complications and up to 40% rate of long-
term restenosis.Acoustic energy modalities have been shown to promote collateral vessel growth, angiogenesis, and to
improve perfusion in animal models of coronary artery disease (CAD) and PAD, with promising early human
data in both disease processes. Vibrato Medical has developed a groundbreaking new treatment with the first
wearable therapeutic ultrasound (TUS) device for the non-invasive, outpatient treatment of PAD that promotes
collateral vessel growth and angiogenesis, and restores perfusion. The VibratoSleeve is a disruptive,
paradigm-shifting device that will fundamentally alter the PAD/CLI landscape with a non-invasive,
wearable, outpatient treatment (1-8 hours during rest or sleep) that will prevent amputations,
hospitalizations and other complications of advanced PAD. We have already demonstrated

While these passive devices offer adequate sound pressure attenuation, an undesired effect persists known as the occlusion effect. Currently, two solutions are utilized to reduce the occlusion effect for in-ear passive devices: deep insertion and ventilation. Deep insertion methods result in a difficult insertion and discomfort for wearers, while ventilation methods often experience an unavoidable reduction in pressure attenuation. The dilemma between eliminating the occlusion effect and maintaining a desired level of attenuation and comfort significantly impedes the development of passive in-ear HPDs or earplugs. To address this, Oto-Biomechanics proposes the development of an in-ear hearing protection device made from a Nanoporous Polyurea Aerogel (NPA), a highly customizable, soft, low-density, and compressible material with the potential to reduce the occlusion effect.

Surveillance of this domain is challenging; the radars and global telescope networks that maintain our current space situational awareness (SSA) are not designed to cover this enlarged volume of space, and at present, self-reported telemetry is the primary source. This is problematic even from friendly assets, let alone from adversaries. Large, ground-based instruments can cover much of the cislunar volume, which extends from geostationary orbit to beyond the Earth-Moon L2 Lagrange point, 12 times farther away. Systems like this are multi-million-dollar facilities, subject to all the issues faced by ground-based telescopes including nighttime operations, geographic coverage, weather, and especially scattered moonlight. Sky brightness near the Moon makes detecting faint objects close to the Moon exceedingly difficult. From the lunar surface, this region is much easier to surveil. The challenge instead is deploying and operating a telescope there. Fortunately, the new activity in cislunar space also offers new opportunities. NASA’s Commercial Lander Payload Service (CLPS) program is developing standardized platforms for instruments on the lunar surface, paralleling the cubesat revolution currently transforming near-Earth space. This means specialized billion-dollar, decade-spanning missions are no longer required -- small, standardized landers will enable routine access to the lunar surface.   The CLPS program presents a tremendous opportunity for deploying small, wide-field optical telescopes on the lunar surface. The first of these will have to be based on optics, detectors and processing systems that already have a heritage in space. There are a large number of optical systems already in space, but only a few of those point out into space, and most of them would not be a good match for the cislunar SSA mission. The right combination of these components could be deployed rapidly and inexpensively on early CLPS missions – so far, the selected instruments only look down at the lunar surface. A small optical telescope, appropriately optimized, could demonstrate the immense value of cislunar SSA from the surface, while at the same time contribute to scientific missions. J. T. McGraw and Associates, LLC (JTMA) proposes to use our extensive expertise in optical design, detector operation, image processing, and the lunar environment to create the most capable cislunar SSA system possible for both initial CLPS landers and for larger, subsequent landers. Ultimately, one or a few telescopes – whether on the ground, in Earth or lunar orbit, or on the lunar surface – will be insufficient to cover this entire subtle and complex orbital environment.

Notwithstanding pre-clinical experiments and clinical trials performed to identify efficacy, side effects, and
adverse drug reactions (ADRs), only 25-60% of patients respond favorably to prescribed drugs, leading to a
cost of $30-$130 billion in the US annually. ADRs are partially attributed to the gut microbiome, i.e. the
complex and dynamic community of microorganisms residing in gastrointestinal tract. The gut microbiome
interacts with different types of xenobiotics including drugs, resulting in biotransformation of therapeutics into
metabolites with altered disposition, efficacy, and toxicity. Gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism leads to
non-effective treatments as well as teratogenic, toxic, and lethal effects that in some cases were not
recognized until the drug was on the market. As a result, leading pharmaceutical researchers have begun to
recognize that the role of gut microbiome in drug metabolism should be accounted for in attempts to improve
treatment effectiveness. However, despite extensive progress in gut microbiome research, there is currently no
reliable, cost-effective approach to integrate gut-mediated drug metabolism in drug development pipelines.
This Phase I proposal aims to address this challenge by developing a new computational platform with the
ability to predict microbial metabolism of therapeutic drugs and to leverage that information to enhance drug
design and development. We will employ a range of state-of-the-art computational biology techniques to
reliably screen for microorganisms that may metabolize the target drugs. The novelty of this project lies in the
ability to screen drug-metabolizing enzymes/microorganisms using multiple metrics and methods to increase
the reliability of predictions to achieve the accuracy necessary for clinical and commercial use. This multi-
method platform will be built, integrated, and validated in an iterative fashion using targeted in vitro
experiments on two candidate drugs, i.e. the anti-arrhythmic drug amiodarone and the anti-viral drug
famciclovir. This project is designed to both advance our current understanding of microbiome function in the
context of drug-gut interactions as well as inform strategies to help enhance public health and economic
growth.
The value proposition of this project includes leveraging publicly available bioinformatics databases as well as
advances in computational biology techniques to develop a more precise, reliable, and inexpensive tool for gut
microbiome-mediated metabolism of therapeutic drugs. This in-silico platform could be employed for both
current drugs as well as drugs under development. For current drugs, this platform can help increase the
safety of drugs by predicting the mechanisms of efficacy and toxicity as they may differ from individual-to-
individual. For new drugs, the platform would reduce the cost and timeframe of drug development, while
increasing the effectiveness of the therapeutics themselves.Project Narrative

and healthcare systems. This project aims to increase the effectiveness of drug development through the
development of a novel computational platform to reliably predict gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism.",  ,,,,MOHAMMAD  SOHEILYPOUR,,(510) 409-1814,msoheilypour@nexilico.com,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,  ,

The envisioned product is a tool for ordinary farmers to increase their production and reduce unnecessary and unpredictable costs, reducing negative impacts on the environment and leading to higher quality food on the table. By converting once complicated, slow, inaccurate practices of insect identification to automated and highly accurate and in real time, this technology will be a part of the automation and data driven industrialization wave transforming the agricultural sector. The quick reaction to pest infestation will allow farmers to better target their response, ultimately making farming more efficient and sustainable. Effective pest control in agriculture is imperative for growers to prevent major crop loss. Certain insect pests are responsible for such significant crop damage which provokes growers to invest in expensive and time-consuming measures to minimize pest effects. The reaction of the grower to the pest is time-sensitive; the timing of the treatment application will directly determine its effectiveness. The proposed technology is an innovative ground-based sensor system that detects plurality of airborne pests in real-time along with their geolocation information. It has capabilities for differentiation and identification of different insect species detected in flight. The instantaneous knowledge of the location of the pest allows for a targeted spray rather than spraying an entire field. Targeted sprays reduce unnecessary spraying and promote more sustainable pest treatment practices. The low-cost sensor that is adequately accurate finally places growers a few steps ahead of the problem, leading them to make wiser treatment decisions such as choosing the time of day to avoid harming beneficial pests and for mitigating drift. The sensor replaces and completely automates the current methods for monitoring insect activity in the crop field, with much better efficiency.

RSOs are SATCOM signals in which the system operator has identified a general location of the emitter. Typically, this location isnâ€™t accurate enough to provide high fidelity compensation to the process. RSOs may not be transmitting when needed and are, therefore, the least reliable reference.

According to the World Health Organization, the 228 million cases of malaria in 2018 were an increase of ~16
million cases over 2015 while the number of deaths was 405,000, not substantially less than in 2015. The
world needs a malaria vaccine. Sanaria’s Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite (PfSPZ) vaccines have protected
100% of subjects against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) in five clinical trials in the U.S., Germany,
Tanzania, and Mali; protected adults for at least 18 months against intense, heterogeneous transmission of Pf
in clinical trials in Burkina Faso, and have been assessed in clinical trials in 6 African and 2 European
countries, and 5 sites in the US in 5 month to 65 year olds. Sanaria has moved to Phase 3 GMP compliant
manufacturing, and is moving toward licensure and commercialization of Sanaria® PfSPZ Vaccine. To
manufacture enough PfSPZ Vaccine to meet the needs of the extensive world markets, particularly those in
Africa, at affordable prices, the scale of manufacturing must be greatly increased and cost of goods (COGs)
reduced. Sanaria’s PfSPZ-based vaccines contain aseptic, purified, cryopreserved, live PfSPZ that are
manufactured in aseptically reared Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. The current method of infected, aseptic,
mosquito production relies heavily upon human power and large quantities of expensive consumables, and
requires significant space. The overarching aim of this application is to design, build, test and refine a semi-
automated mosquito bioreactor, which will enable hands-free harvesting of aseptic, PfSPZ-infected, adult A.
stephensi and transfer of PfSPZ-infected mosquitoes to an Infected Mosquito Transfer Container (IMTC) ready
for irradiation and dissection, significantly reducing upstream manufacturing costs of PfSPZ products. During
this Phase II SBIR we will finalize a system for semi-automated, closed-system production of aseptic
mosquitoes from eggs through to infected adults ready for irradiation. The specific aims are: 1) Redesign the
larval bioreactor for hands-free, aseptic culturing from eggs to larvae to adult mosquitoes; 2) Redesign adult
mosquito container part 1: direct transfer of adults from the larval bioreactor; 3) Redesign adult mosquito
container part 2: semi-automated transfer of infected mosquitoes to the Infected Mosquito Transfer Container;
4) Redesign the Infected Mosquito Transfer Container for hands free transfer and re-use; and 5) Integrate all
steps and demonstrate their utility for manufacturing in an engineering run of PfSPZ Challenge. Developing
this bioreactor will lead to a sea change in Sanaria’s capacity to manufacture its PfSPZ products, putting
Sanaria on track for robust, mass-scale manufacturing at phase 3 GMP compliance at a significantly reduced

Optical computing represents the a potential path forward in the expansion of computing power. Hybrid devices utilizing organic electro-optic (OEO) materials are a potential enabling technology for electronic-photonic digital computing (EPDC), with further applications in telecommunications, quantum computing, and quantum networking. Compared to existing silicon photonics and microwave photonics systems, hybrid electro-optics deliver critical performance enhancements, with potential for improved capabilities and lower operating costs for computing and 5G telecommunications systems. The growth of EPDC will also reduce power consumption and carbon footprints of high-performance computing and cloud computing, especially intensive applications such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, where operations are particularly conducive to being performed optically. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project directly addresses key challenges in bringing high-performance hybrid organic electro-optic (OEO) components capable of direct integration with conventional silicon-based semiconductor technologies to market. Hybrid devices utilizing OEO materials have demonstrated significant advantages in speed, size, and power consumption compared to existing technologies. However, rigorous definition of materials properties, optimization of long-term thermal and photostability, and ability to translate new OEO material concepts into commercial materials are essential for establishing market viability. This project includes evaluating stability and encapsulation techniques to ensure long-term reliability and commercial-scale synthesis of a next-generation material for commercial applications, translating recent academic developments from theory aided design into a commercial supply chain. These results will de-risk adoption of hybrid OEO-based technologies and enable a wider range of applications via higher performance and better understanding of thermal constraints and encapsulation requirements.

Ambassador Way,,Salt Lake City,Utah,84108,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
PEEL Therapeutics, Inc. (PEEL) is pioneering a novel approach to prevent morbidity and mortality
associated with inflammatory disease through the inhibition of neutrophil extracellular traps
(NETs). NETs are lattices of decondensed chromatin decorated with histones and antimicrobial
proteins extruded by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) to trap and kill microbes. While
regulated NET formation contains infection, dysregulated NET formation leads to inflammatory
tissue damage and vascular injury. NETs have been implicated in human diseases characterized
by inflammation, including sepsis, stroke, diabetes, and heart disease. The ability of NET-
inhibitory factors (NIFs) to block PMN-dependent NET formation makes this newly described
class of endogenous peptides a promising therapeutic modality for diseases caused and/or
exacerbated by NET-dependent inflammatory events. In this Phase I SBIR, PEEL will quantify
and compare the biological activity and pharmacokinetics of two NIFs in vitro and in vivo. The
lead NIF peptide will move forward in the development of a novel anti-NET therapeutic. After
completing these SBIR Phase I tasks, PEEL Therapeutics will be in an excellent position to
advance its new and patented NIF-based therapeutic to further preclinical studies. These efforts
by PEEL Therapeutics hold the potential to disrupt and improve the treatment approach to both
acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Dysregulated inflammation leads to significant disease-associated morbidity and mortality,
contributing to more than 30 million annual deaths worldwide. PEEL Therapeutics, Inc. is an
emerging biotech that specializes in delivery of peptides and proteins to treat serious human
diseases and has licensed novel peptides with unique biological properties to block inflammation
as potential therapeutic agents for multiple inflammatory diseases. Development of novel
strategies for inhibiting the molecular mechanisms of dysregulated immune response that
lead to tissue and vascular damage has the potential to save millions of lives and
profoundly impact human suffering from these inflammatory diseases.",  ,,,,ALEAH F CAULIN,,(415) 306-5534,acaulin@peeltx.com,,  ,

Recently, defense programs have made clear an intention to operate small satellites in geosynchronous orbit (GEO) and beyond in cislunar space (xGEO). At these distances, rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) conducted by a remote operator become impractical due to communications delays. The autonomy paradigm shifts the bulk of the work to the remote vehicle with limited ground intervention, which not only improves resilience of the system but also enables coordinated activity across multiple spacecraft. However, flight software in general is expensive to develop, and the expense is compounded for autonomous systems that must perform a variety of mission functions. Hand-coding software is a significant bottleneck in terms of both time and developer expertise. Additionally, autonomous space missions benefit significantly from the ability to re-program or re-task agents over their lifetime. It is difficult (and expensive) to pre-engineer all possible contingency scenarios into the flight software. A robust autonomy framework provides a mechanism for re-programming or re-tasking a system. Ideally, the vehicle operator should be able to re-task the vehicle without expert knowledge of the underlying flight software. The proposed Phase I research addresses the need for an autonomy methodology that can be programmed without extensive hand-coding. The proposed approach will assess options for user interfaces (UIs) for control and tasking of autonomous systems to identify key features for software developers and operators. A proof of concept demonstration will be conducted by selecting an existing UI for integration with Emergent’s mature flight software. The demonstration will be based on two existing technologies: 1) Distributed Automation Suite for Heuristic Execution and Response (DASHER) autonomy software; 2) Framework for Reuse of Code Transformation Logic (FRCTL) automatic code generation technology. FRCTL will connect the UI to the DASHER software by ingesting the output of the UI and generating artifacts that are read by DASHER at runtime. The result is an intuitive interface for specifying the behavior of an autonomous system, enabling autonomy missions to be designed and executed without expert knowledge of DASHER. Autonomy has the potential to enable safe multiagent operations and RPO. However, implementing a plan for an autonomous mission in source code is challenging and expensive. Incorporating a UI into the autonomy software is a critical development to enable widespread adoption of the software in operational environments. This research will enable satellite operators to program and retask autonomous vehicles by integrating Emergent’s DASHER and FRCTL software technologies with an existing UI, significantly reducing the software support required over the duration of a mission.  ",Thomas  McNitt,,(310) 653-9488,thomas.mcnitt.2@us.af.mil,Timothy  Woodbury,,(205) 534-9515,tim.woodbury@emergentspace.com,,  ,

The feasibility of using a system which integrates hydrodynamic cavitation based pretreatment, anaerobic digestion, and a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) to convert black water and food wastes into methane-enriched biogas suitable for power and non-potable water generation will be demonstrated. During hydrodynamic cavitation, transient high temperatures and pressures rapidly decompose cellular matter and breakdown complex biomass in the influent waste stream, so that it can be more quickly fermented by anaerobic microorganisms that create methane-enriched biogas during the anaerobic digestion process. This energy production process is enhanced by MEC inclusion, which allows microorganisms to catalyze electrochemical reactions, greatly increasing the energy production and the percentage of methane in the produced biogas (from 60 to 95%).

Cyber criminals, including state sponsored attackers, are always  searching for ways to break in…ways to attack us...ways to disable our armed forces and government. Nowhere could the stakes be higher than with the safety and continued operations of the warfighter and their ability to protect the United States.   USAF and other armed forces remain highly vulnerable to these disabling attacks through their own unprotected, unmanaged, unmonitored devices on their networks such as networked printers and other internet of things devices. While these devices have built-in security features to shield USAF networks from penetration, they are often not enabled, managed or maintained, turning these devices into wide open doors for hackers to walk through.  Printers in print fleets, despite having sometimes as many as 300 security controls built-in, have been put on USAF networks without being properly configured for security. Printers are the second most prevalent information technology (IT) asset type on all networks, they are the most technologically advanced networked device, but they are also the least protected and most vulnerable networked device. The typical printer on a USAF network is set to factory defaults of 40-60 open ports, a published password that any state sponsored criminal can look up on the internet, and is unmanaged from a security standpoint leaving the USAF open and exposed. Symphion recognized this world-wide cyber security gap and has designed advanced software and processes to address it. Symphion is commercially delivering its solution throughout the US to prevent (shield) these vulnerable devices, networks and businesses from cyber attack by establishing and maintaining security configuration of their already built-in security features, updating firmware and managing each device throughout its lifecycle with advanced automation.

Routing mmW signals from antennas to processing units is currently done with coaxial cables which, for these frequencies, are heavy, expensive, prone to failure, and suffer signal degradation. RF over fiber (RFoF), is a promising technology which uses fiber optics to transmit mmW signals between computing resources and antennas.  The result is substantial savings in weight and cost, improved reliability, increased bandwidth, and immunity to EM.  In the proposed project Mosaic Microsystems will work with Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Laboratories (LM ATL) and the Air Force’s AIM Photonics Institute to investigate the feasibility of using Mosaic’s ultra-thin glass with through-glass via (TGV) technology to form the basis of an RF over fiber (RFoF) transceiver.

We have built a user interface (UI) on top of RAIC, which provides users with an intuitive interface to their dataset enhanced with RAIC. With the UI, users can select objects of interest, quickly locate other occurrences, and then automatically train an AI model for high-accuracy object detection from within the domain (e.g., EO or SAR) in which the object was identified. This technology provides the means to rapidly gather and annotate 100s to 1000s of data points in seconds, train an AI model (typical training times can vary from minutes to hours), and run that model across an entire dataset. Preliminary results suggest that this entire procedure can be reduced to less than 15 minutes on EO data of approximately 100GB in size. Preliminary results also show RAIC producing detection models that rival state of the art in terms of performance; however, RAIC does not require the otherwise typical man-months of human annotation and labeling. RAIC excels in domains where labeled data is extremely sparse and annotation tasks would otherwise be too time intensive or infeasible. Our RAIC technology has been designed around cloud solution architecture, which provides scalability into petabyte sized datasets. Additionally, we’re able to easily deploy our application in a low-latency manner across the US and worldwide to include off-cloud offerings that can run behind firewalls, aka secure environments. RAIC technology has dual use applicability for the 16th Air Force 363d ISR Wing and 480th ISR Wing groups who need faster ways to monitor change, extract key insights, and enable automation through AI models with minimal human machine interaction. Our proposal seeks to demonstrate the value and performance of our RAIC technology for enabling rapid object labeling, AI modeling, and object detection tasks across imagery types while minimizing extensive labeling effort. In our previous proof of technology exercise, our cloud-based RAIC evaluated 3-inch resolution EO imagery of a large US metropolitan area (400 sq. km.) and enabled a non-expert labeler to annotate objects of interest, build and run a detection AI from only a handful of selected objects in under an hour.

In skies where air dominance is not secure and where there is a threat from enemy fighter aircraft or advanced missile systems, the option for insertion of supplies via airdrop from C-130 or C-17 becomes problematic. To mitigate this risk. To address these fundamental issues, Freedom Flight and its team propose the development of a long-range powered parafoil air cargo delivery system that can be air deployed from Air Force cargo aircraft: Long Range Precision Aerial Delivery System (LRPADS).  LRPADS will enable launch offset ranges of up to 350 miles, eliminating the need for transport aircraft to enter contested airspace and ensuring critical resupply operations continue unimpeded. LRPADS is configured as a ‘stack’, with the propulsion system, guidance system, and parafoil wing stowed on top of the pallet until deployment. As the pallet is deployed from the aircraft, the parachute releases, pulling the propulsion unit into position from its stowed orientation. As the pallet is deployed from the aircraft, the parachute releases, pulling the propulsion unit into position from its stowed orientation. Once in position, the propulsion unit engages, and the system proceeds to its target destination. The LRPADS configuration is flexible, allowing for propulsion system selection based on mission needs. For more permissive environments, the Signature Optimized Conventional Option (SOCO), consisting of a reciprocating engine and ducted propeller, will enable reduced-signature propulsion with lower cost and greater attritability. For non-permissive environments, the Powered Parafoil Fluidic Propulsion System (PP-FPS) enables maximum signature reduction for missions that demand near ‘silence’ to ensure high-value cargo reaches its destination. Freedom Flight’s cargo delivery system will also enable long offset powered parafoil deployment of other mission-ready cargos. It could be configured to deliver kinetic payloads, such as Raytheon Griffin missiles. In this configuration, palletized munitions could be delivered close to enemy positions while reducing risk to high-value Air Force assets by taking advantage of the reduced signatures and extremely low cost of powered parafoils. Because this weapon system would be ‘attritable’, a multitude of the remotely commanded, strike units could be used simultaneously as an element in long-range precision fires swarming tactics to be added to the forward deployed force structure. This configuration will meet the Strategic Capability need Complexity, Unpredictability, and Mass by augmenting high-end platforms with larger numbers of inexpensive, low-end systems in order to increase adaptability and the capacity to absorb losses. LRPADS has a clear technical roadmap to delivering a extremely low cost, reliable, flexible cargo delivery system in the near term. ",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Austin  Blue,,(619) 881-0111,ablue@freedomflightworks.com,,  ,

In this proposed Phase I, Lux will direct the development of its System-on-Foil platform for the manufacture of lightweight, radiation tolerant microelectronics. With the emergence of proliferated low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations and the increasing interest to further occupy geostationary orbit (GEO) and beyond, there is a growing need to enable complete satellite autonomy. Creating autonomy, however, will require a massive increase in on-board processing given the limitation in communications to ground stations. Due to the harsh radiation environment of space, current space electronics often require boxy metal enclosures that are prohibitively large, heavy, and expensive to be deployed pervasively. These bottlenecks can be mitigated by reducing the size of the electronics, thereby reducing the size, weight, and expense of the metal enclosure. To effectuate this change, Lux proposes a radical departure from the relatively large and rigid printed circuit board (PCB) assemblies in use today. Instead, Lux has developed a flexible, high density interconnect system to integrate semiconductor chips into a single, standalone semiconductor package. This System-on-Foil package offers a replacement option to PCBs, which has the potential to miniaturize equivalent electronics by up to 10X. In this proposed Phase I, Lux will seek to identify a target use case to quantify its expected advantages against PCBs in both size and weight.

Dynamic glass, is a proven approach to reduce the energy consumption in DoD buildings. Unfortunately, COTS dynamic window technologies are expensive (on the order of $100-$150/sq ft installed). Moreover, the installation of dynamic window requires full demolition and replacement of the existing windows. This level of construction activity results in high installation expenses and the displacement of occupant.  What is needed is a technology that is cost-efficient and easily retrofit onto existing windows. Furcifer has developed such a solution – a laminable electrochromic window film that is produced using modern roll-to-roll printing technologies at 1/5 to 1/10 the cost of traditional dynamic glass at the same scale, and is the first EC film that can be directly applied to existing windows as an aftermarket application. By directly laminating the film onto the window glass, existing windows are retrofit into dynamic windows. Furcifer’s utilizes next-generation, flexible electrochromic (EC) film that can be manufactured via standard wet methods such as roll-to-roll printing. Furcifer has created soluble electrochromic inks and electrolytes to enable fabrication directly onto flexible substrates such as ITO (Indium Tin Oxide, a transparent conductor) on PET (polyethylene terephthalate, a common plastic). This  leads to a weight reduction of 100x over glass. By bypassing expensive semiconductor and vacuum deposition and for low-cost printing methods, Furcifer has eliminated 99% of the capital cost of production. The low manufacturing capex and the light weight of the EC films, allows Furcifer to geographically distribute manufacturing further reducing shipping costs and the total energy cost of the installed product. The EC films can be shipped to any DoD’s global facility with minimum shipping cost. Furcifer’s robust, flexible EC film can be laminated onto any flat or curved surface, making it very easy to retrofit the existing DoD’s IGUs. It does not require demolition of the original window or displacement of occupants in operational facilities. In this way, Furcifer’s EC film has the potential to break the primary barriers to adoption of dynamic windows for DoD installations. If broadly adopted, the EC technology could reduce global DoD facility energy consumption by up to 10% with total facilities peak load reductions of up to 25%. Such reductions broadly implemented could ease existing strain on the national grid. Overall, the EC film technology addresses two of DoD’s three key installation energy goals: (1) reduce energy usage/intensity and (2) improve energy security",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Jian  Wang,,(510) 516-6909,jianwang@furciferinc.com,,  ,

The USAF, like the rest of the world, is rapidly adopting IoT devices as part of its commercial systems, including controls and sensors in critical infrastructure to enhance operations and reduce costs, but these devices are unprotected and ignored. Every sensor such as a wall thermostat or pressure gauge offers a way for malicious actors to enter and compromise USAF networks. In April of last year, state sponsored Iranian cyber criminals were linked to a cyber-sabotage of Israeli water supplies. The criminals sought to cripple computers that control water and wastewater treatment in Israel, proof that our adversaries are fully capable of doing the same to us, crippling our operations by attacking USAF critical infrastructure systems. It has and will continue to happen here in the United States. We are not impervious to attacks on critical infrastructure. In fact, a cyber intrusion into an American water treatment facility occurred this month, February 2021. In Pinellas County, Florida a cyber criminal infiltrated and poisoned the water supply by penetrating the treatment facility’s online system.

The current Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) antenna node provides the foundation upon which a flexible, capable and operationally suitable architecture is possible. Users add nodes as required in a building block approach, meeting operational vignette scenarios and technical performance requirements. With each added node, the respective array increases in number of supported contacts and contact reception G/T.  The EMD unit demonstrated the feasibility of taking the LINKS multi satellite electronically steered antenna to TRL7. The current engineering unit demonstrated the capability for telemetry, tracking and collection of mission data from satellites. LINKS is capable of 14-17 dBi/K per beam G/T, multiple simultaneous beams, downlink in LEO and GEO, Auto tracking in LEO and GEO, coherent combining of disjointed panels, digital signal enhancement, and ATLAS Freedom™ Software Platform integration.  The flexible and scalable architecture is made possible by ATLAS’ proprietary signal processing algorithm that allows the user to dynamically reconfigure array layout and resource allocation for maximum mission performance. Signal gain is achieved through a symbol-aware noise removal algorithm that also removes RF carrier effects, reducing RF grating lobes. This enables combining from disjointed, heterogeneous receivers. G/T thus becomes a matter of scheduling, varying with array physical size as well as with downlink signal types.  During the next generation development phase, ATLAS will conduct rigorous systems engineering and product line development tasks which will result in a fully-tested EMD antenna node (or node varieties).  LINKS will be capable of on-demand performance enhancements by scaling to mission requirements up to and including SCN class antenna performance.

Concerningly, the effects of medical worker burnout can be visibly observed in brain scans. Further research shows that burnout often leads to life-threatening medical errors. Medical worker burnout is so severe that it is now being compared to PTSD with its impact on readiness and has only become more severe since COVID. Research shows that adult medical professionals that experienced childhood trauma may experience worse symptoms of burnout. However, this situation can be resolved and prevented with new innovations and insights in psychology and neuroscience. Lamm et al. 2011 demonstrated with brain imaging that the brains of medical workers subconsciously experience the suffering of their patients. The use of empathy by care providers increases the quality of care provided, but it also increases the severity of “burnout” of the medical worker, because he or she is subconsciously experiencing mental suffering.

To date, ultrasonic and thermographic inspection is the only means, aside from visual inspection, that is used to judge the quality of adhesively bonded structures and bond repairs.  The current nondestructive inspection techniques involving ultrasonic inspection are not capable of determining bond strength for certification of bonded structures, limiting bonded joint acceptance for critical structures. Laser Bond Inspection (LBI) offers a method to characterize adhesive bond strength that are absent from traditional NDT techniques (Ultrasonic Inspection).  The LBI method has been matured for evaluating the composite-to-composite adhesive bonds.  LBI can be also used to validate the integrity of adhesive bonds during the repair process by identifying weak bonded repairs and to detect the presence of “kissing bonds.”  The implementation of the LBI method is to verify the adhesive bonding process is under control and the bond meets the intended design requirements.  Laser Bond Inspection (LBI) will benefit the repair process by verifying the repair strength, ensuring aircraft safety and minimize rework of metal-to-metal bonds.

Compared to civilians, veterans are 2.5 times more likely to have diabetes due to the past physical strain with chronic pain and degenerative joint damage, and each year, the Department of VA spends over $1.5 billion to treat diabetic patients. One complication of diabetes is diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), which reduces sensitivity in the feet, affecting 50% of patients and increasing their chances of developing ulcerating wounds (diabetic foot ulcers – DFUs). DFUs have become a silent killer of veterans, with 40% of those diagnosed with the problem dying within 5 years. DFUs precede 85% of diabetes related amputations, and in 2018 alone, over 9,000 veterans had lower extremity amputations (LEAs), with more than 3,000 involving foot loss. In 2019, the V.A. treated more than 75,000 DFUs at an average cost of $47,000 each, translating to over $3.5 billion just for foot care. The lack of sensation by DPN patients leads to catastrophic delays in the identification of foot ulcers. Patients only notice them when they have fully developed and now requiring extensive and costly treatment or, at worst – amputation. For such patients, there is a need for daily skin temperature monitoring to provide early warning signs of inflammation and tissue injury.

The problem is much of this user feedback is acquired inconsistently, with varying levels of quality, and in unstructured formats – interview transcripts or videos, interview notes, qualitative survey answers, observations, and such. This creates a significant challenge for companies to acquire user data that is accurate and dependable, in formats that are able to be shared and searched by multiple teams – at scale. Limited access to users exacerbates this issue, with precious time wasted asking similar questions and poor research techniques making true insights difficult to glean. Rocket Communications (“Rocket”) is developing a commercial solution for this unmet need, which will help designers/developers build better research plans, aid in collection of user data, act as a central, collective repository for all of this research, and provide analytical tools that create actionable insights that can be used across the company. This will not only help with new product development, but can improve training, product usability, customer service, and more. While Rocket is initially developing this tool for internal use, they intend to license it for client use, as a more robust, lower cost, and simpler-to-use alternative to the incomplete tools available today. They call this tool “Arachne.”  In addition to commercial prospects for a solution like this, Rocket has validated that there is a need for an adapted version of Arachne in the DoD. Fast growing software factories such as the Kobayashi Maru initiative within the Enterprise Cross Mission Ground organization at SMC are working to solve operational problems with user-centric, in-house development programs. These teams, however, face the same user engagement problems as commercial developers, perhaps even more so due to the challenges of working in classified environments. Multiple teams need access to the same overworked operators and frequently ask similar questions; less-experienced teams are untrained on user research; and research that is obtained is generally not turned into actionable insights to be leveraged across teams. Utilizing Arachne for user research data gathering will empower our warfighters with better designed software based on actual user engagement which will improve efficiency in training and usage (saving both time and money). Additionally, Arachne will improve user data accuracy through intuitive research workflows and will enable better manpower utilization by allowing user research to be shared across the organization instead of siloed and used only by the team acquiring the data.",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Cathy  Meyer,,(415) 863-0101,cathym@rocketcom.com,,  ,

Sustainably polyols aremade from vegetable oils but their performance is constrained by the oil's polymeric structure.Woody resources including forest products construction demolition wood and paper/cardboardwaste can be pyrolytically depolymerized and repolymerized as polyols. Starting from sugarmonomers instead of from unsaturated oils enables precise control over polyol structure.Polyols based on woody biomass promise both high performance and sustainability.This PhI SBIR will synthesize high performance polyols for polyurethane foams fromlevoglucosan the dominant pyrolysis product of cellulose. Utilizing our existing chemistryplatform levoglucosan will be converted to Cerny epoxides which will polymerize as polyols.The woody biomass based polyols will be characterized for melt temperature melt viscosity andhydroxyl value. Then they will be combined with diisocyantes to make foams. The foams will becharacterized for elastomeric properties. This synthesis-characterization loop informed bystructure-function relationships will iterate to high performance sustainable polyols.Consumer demand for sustainable polyurethane foam will drive demand for levoglucosan. Thehigh value levoglucosan product leverages simultaneous pyrolysis product streams (phenolic oilbiochar and glucose/xylose) to make investment in pyrolysis plants financially attractive.Demonstrating woody biomass based polyols will catalyze organic growth of local pyrolysisplants. The global market of polyols for polyurethane foam is 17B USD/yr. A novel sustainablepolyol could garner large market share. Almost all of this polyol would be exported as the USaccounts for only 12% of global PUR demand. $17B in exports accounts for about 3% of the UStrade deficit. Supplying the world with polyols would sequester 60M tpy of CO or about 1% of2

Atomus’ innovative approach can be adapted for the Air Force to enhance the software inventory practices by adding efficiency through automation, eliminating the current process where Air Force personnel manually inventory applications on each computer. This results in greater cost savings from the identification of duplicate and obsolete software applications while exponentially reducing the number of man hours the Air Force is currently dedicating to manually complete this process. It is believed that duplicative software licenses and technical support which isn’t utilized by the military costs the Air Force tens of millions of dollars each year.

accounting for over 1.7M cases annually just in the US. Characterized by high mortality rates (~20%), prognosis
for septic patients deteriorates hourly in the absence of appropriate treatment. Timely and accurate pathogen
identification is critical to match treatment to the infection. Unfortunately, current diagnostic approaches for
BSIs rely on blood culture, which is slow (1-3 days) and unreliable in the presence of prior antimicrobial
treatment. In the meantime, physicians must rely on broad-spectrum treatment, which often misses the infection,
leads to complications, and drives antimicrobial resistance. New diagnostic approaches are needed which can
quickly detect and identify the infectious agent directly from blood, without culturesTo address this unmet need, HelixBind has developed a sample to answer process which can identify
bacterial and fungal BSIs directly from blood in 3 hours. Utilizing a proprietary detection approach leveraging
synthetic, duplex DNA invading, nucleic acids, the assay provides species level detail at single CFUs/ml
sensitivity. dsDNA invasion-based detection (rather than ssDNA hybridization) affords single-bp specificity and
the ability to reliably differentiate between closely related species and reduce false-positives due to random
contaminations. To date, though, invasion has never been demonstrated in a format appropriate for massively
parallel detection. In this proposal, HelixBind will develop, for the first time, a DNA invasion array which can
detect and identify hundreds of pathogens simultaneously. This array will be incorporated into a sample-to-
answer fluidic cassette operated on a benchtop instrument. The resulting test will provide clinicians with
comprehensive coverage of essentially all pathogens associated with BSIs and unequivocal identification of an
infection within hours of patient presentation, enabling early application of appropriate antimicrobials,
improving care and saving countless lives.HelixBind has previously established the capability of fluid-based invasion to identify BSIs from clinical
samples and in this application, we present preliminary data for solid-phase array-based invasion, allowing
massively multiplexed detection. In this proposal we will address the biophysical challenges associated with
creating a highly multiplexed dsDNA invasion array and the technical hurdles associated with integrating this
array into a sample-to-answer fluidic device. Specific Aims, each with quantifiable deliverables, serve to address
the key risks and progressive steps in the development process. Upon completion of this Phase II project, we
will have a fully functional assay and a product appropriate for manufacturing scale up and clinical testing. We
will also have developed a new, highly multiplexed assay format, with single-bp resolution, which can be
adapted for a wide range of applications requiring sensitive and specific differentiation among closely related
targets.",  ,,,,ALON  SINGER,,(508) 460-1028,asinger@helixbind.com,,  ,

Adulterated or contaminated fuel has poor ignition quality and thermal stability, leading to a substantial increase in engine wear and can result in engine failure for aircraft. Fuel quality testing is essential to Air Force operations, however existing methods of fuel testing require time and sophisticated equipment: two things that are often hard to come by in the field. Samples must be sent to off-site locations or trained fuels quality lab personnel must deploy, delaying flying operations. Freedom Flight’s Fuel Ignition Quality Measurement Tool (FIQMT) is a self-contained single small handheld instrument not requiring lab training or lab facilities to operate that is able to perform jet fuel particulate contamination (particle counter), free water determination, and assess thermal stability properties in field conditions to easily determine whether fuel is of suitable quality. The device contains a miniaturized combustion chamber and piston. Fuel to be tested is injected into the chamber, as the piston completes its compression stroke and sensors within the device measure the fuel’s ignition response time, with the device displaying a simple pass/fail reading to easily determine whether the fuel is acceptable for use. Since the AF started using commercial jet fuel there have been an increase in the number of fuel quality related issues involving jet fuel inventories at bases failing a critical chemical property, Thermal Stability. Aircraft use fuel as a heat sink for their thermal management system. Heat can cause the jet fuel to degrade and form deposits within engine, reducing engine component life. Samples must be sent to off-base labs for testing, which can take days. In addition to determining ignition quality, FIQMT will be helpful in identifying thermal stability issues in fuel. Poor ignition quality is most often a result of substandard storage conditions that cause fuel degradation. These same conditions also affect a fuel’s thermal stability, making FIQMT’s identification of poor ignition quality a strong indicator of the existence of stability issues. FIQMT is inexpensive and portable, making it perfectly suited to widespread adoption by governments looking confirm fuel quality, root out unlawful sellers, and reduce air pollution or logistics companies trying to reduce wear and tear on their vehicles. For the warfighter, FIQMT delivers a fuel testing device that can be used in austere environments, delivers test results rapidly, and ensures fuel suitability for vehicles used in essential operations.

The future of sustainment is in prescriptive analytics: predicting what will fail, when & how it will fail, and, what can be done about it? Prescriptive analytics demands timely, accurate forecasts of a system’s path to failure. PointPro builds on the user’s digital twin physics-based models to deliver forecasts within user defined accuracy. Our software leverages the time-tested robustness and versatility of Monte Carlo simulations in a closed-loop architecture, making it possible to deliver guaranteed accuracy in the forecast of system specific quantities of interest. When prediction errors are detected to exceed user-defined bounds, a sequence of optimization problems are solved, that in effect answer a long-standing question in predictive simulation: to meet a required level of accuracy, how big should the simulation size be? Consequently, a decision-quality, certifiably actionable forecast is generated in a single-shot, in minimal time. The platform integrates equally with physics-based evolutionary models and with data-driven (ML) models; and offers means to improve such models. In benchmark studies conducted so far, up to 3x productivity gain has been demonstrated. Moreover, gains improve with increasing system complexity. In this Phase I STTR, a feasibility study is proposed to elicit feedback from SMEs regarding PointPro use for forecasting complex systems. In particular, the project will focus on optimized asset sustainment needs for USAF jet engines and space assets.

To keep the platform mission ready, the 309th Software Engineering Group (309SWEG), designs, builds, tests, and deploys software upgrades to its multi-function display and pilot vehicle interface (MFD/PVI). The potential for error in their work and the harm it could inflict translates to lengthy test and evaluation (T&E) processes. Those processes add years to software rollout, stagnating both A-10 and more broadly Air Force modernization efforts while our adversaries march forward. Critically, an update to a single line of code for the MFD/PVI can take up-to 2 years to push into operations due to T&E alone. With the 309SWEG, CrowdAI seeks to reduce the time to complete visual inspection of MFD/PVI using computer vision, a form of artificial intelligence, to evaluate that interface during T&E. CrowdAI can address this critical challenge to aircraft modernization by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI). Using computer vision, a subfield of AI, CrowdAI software will evaluate the MFD/PVI, just as a pilot would see them, allowing 309SWEG System Test Engineers to reconcile the flight computer commands to the MFD/PVI with what is visually displayed. But, unlike a human, who tires under cognitive load and prolonged tasks, AI can process video longer and even faster than it can be collected. AI reduces the labor required for manual review of video, freeing personnel to higher-cognitive tasks. Long term, similar capabilities could be applied to other combat aircraft, not just the A-10, as well integrate at all different stages of testing, not just development, but acceptance, and operational.      Under Phase I award, CrowdAI will provide a product demonstration to the 309SWEG, Air Force Test Center (AFTC) and other stakeholders for a potential Phase II. CrowdAI will work with 309SWEG to identify customers and stakeholders key to transitioning the solution into the enterprise, presumably within Platform One.

These models can evaluate greater quantities of imagery than an analyst and in a fraction of the time—and AI never tires, reducing the probability of error.

With so many different efforts offering competing algorithmic solutions and without any standardization between programs it is becoming increasingly difficult to determine what the best solution is for particular common applications. SMC has taken strides recently to foster open OPIR innovation through efforts like the TAP Lab. To date there is no clear way to compare competing algorithms even in such open environments.

WiGL enables wireless charging or remote powering of electronic devices in a way that is as simple as using a WiFi LAN as a means to access the internet. The uniqueness of WiGL is its ability to turn any AC/DC power source(s) or EMR sources into a wireless electrical transmitter, connect the transmitters and form adhoc WiGL networks. With WiGL, AC/DC power or EMR is smartly routed and managed to create smart power wireless power microgrid Local Area Network (LAN), Personal Area Network, (PAN) or Wide Area Network (WAN). This unique capability allows infinite mobility of devices while charging, similar to how mobile phones stay connected to cellular coverage or Wi-Fi. To increase microgrid coverage area, a WiGL transmitter is added to the wireless power network, eliminating the need for close proximity or physical contact between charger and device, effectively disrupting the status quo of wireless power transfer. In addition to charging, WiGL can also pass traditional data and encryption to/from devices simultaneously making a separate power connection redundant. Experiments have demonstrated the technology harvesting Wi-Fi frequency for wireless power.

However, low-cost, high-impulse propulsion for satellite maneuvering that is also safe for ridesharing does not exist.

Resource scarcity and regional considerations must be anticipated in advance in order to ensure that all necessary materials are forward deployed. Operational missions can be further complicated by potentially unpredictable resupply of essential materials and equipment. Consequently, excessive amounts of costly on-demand inventory often must be pre-positioned in case of aging equipment failure or compromised reserve replenishment. These considerations can constrain innovative autonomy, increase supply chain costs and delay fulfilling mission objectives. Recent manufacturing advancements offer potential locally-based alternatives to reduce the dependence on materials and equipment otherwise imported into theater using 3D printing. However, the ability to produce functional 3D prints is contingent on access to input materials, which can degrade over time. Specifically, the ability to source locally available raw material and feed it directly as pellets or shavings/flake into a printer rather than extruded filament could be extremely advantageous for the warfighter by reducing cost and increasing capabilities in prototyping and on demand fabrication. Further, the ability to use plastic waste as a feedstock has the added benefit of reducing supply chain costs, achieving sustainability goals, and allowing plastic waste to become a useful by-product of innovation. The benefits of this innovation are amplified when 3D printing large-scale industrial objects (defined as > 18 inches cubed). First, the production of large-scale products represents a larger investment of time and material costs (pellets are ~ 1/10th the cost of filament). A second reason for the importance of pellet extrusion is the ability to print significantly faster. With domain expertise in large-scale 3D printing, re:3D has developed a pellet extrusion 3D printer capable of printing with pellets and able to accept reclaimed flake as well as non-uniform pellets. This effort includes developing the ability to consistently dry and to easily clean and switch between materials. A novel mechanism for feeding larger volumes of pellets and/or flake into the platform is also being developed with the requisite controls as well as a desktop grinding system.  Possible AF users of this hardware have expressed interest packaging this equipment in footprint optimized for DoD benefit.  This award would allow for the opportunity to customize a full suite of hardware to enable the processing of waste for 3D printing. Specifally, re:3D proposes to analyze the plastic waste created at USAFA, to determine which of those plastics can be printed, and to created a system to allow for the printing of parts, drones and other items directly from trash in a containerized 3D printing Mobile Recycling Facility (MRF).",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Samantha  Snabes,,(512) 730-0033,samantha@re3d.org,,  ,

Where that data reduction is done on board using low-SWaP computers, algorithms must be trained and installed pre-launch before any real-world data has been collected. For over two decades, the industry standard synthetic scene generation tool from Proton Research Associates, PRA Toolkit, has been the gold standard for physics-based overhead persistent infrared (OPIR) scene generation. Unfortunately, the software has not been maintained during much of that time. Intervening years have seen the development of TPUs, GPUs, multi-core processors and high-performance cloud computing resources, none of which can be utilized by PRA Toolkit. SciTec’s proposed OPIR Model Image Creation Responsive to Orbital Needs (OMICRON) is an updated scene generation toolchain based on the FLITES v2.2 simulation engine with expanded background scene capabilities specifically tailored to the simulation of OPIR and similar on-orbit imaging. OMICRON will include the necessary plugins to directly convert PRA Toolkit background scene databases into FLITES backgrounds, as well as the ability to manage large, high resolution tiled imagery (e.g., Vricon/MAXAR) to accommodate modern and future satellite payloads. OMICRON will also include plugins for managing satellite orbital motion, attitude control, and payload commanding to streamline the simulation pipeline.

This challenge is exacerbated in the increasingly common situations where predicted conjunctions or system issues require operators to maneuver spacecraft.  Each maneuver require operators to first assess situations; create multiple potential evasive maneuver options; quickly evaluate those options and their implications on other risks, system status, and mission priorities; and clearly and quickly communicate the entire situation and recommended scenarios across operation centers and to decision makers. Delays in this process or unintended consequences due to imperfect mental models can have significant consequences, including compromised mission success, missed opportunities, wasted fuel, or orbital shifts that create additional downstream conjunction risks. Rocket Communications (Rocket) has a solution: Space Awareness, Communication, and Maneuver Evaluation, or “Space ACME.” Rocket proposes leveraging their commercial 3D modeling engines and their USSF-sanctioned Astro User Experience Design System (Astro UXDS) to create an integrated visualization system to improve decision making related to spacecraft maneuvers. Rocket’s solution, Space ACME will provide an intuitive and visual system for operators to envision system status, orbits, and predicted events; easily create multiple maneuver options and view/compare them to help decision-makers quickly grasp implications and improve decisions. Visualizing predicted maneuvers along with other RSO orbits and mission needs (i.e. changes in earth field of view) will also lead to better outcomes. Utilizing and augmenting the Astro UXDS standardized visual language/formats will enable commonality and greatly improve communication of state of health/alternatives across operation centers. Advanced data visualization for space operations and near-real time course of action (COA) generation tools were noted as a “Top 20” Short Term Objectives for 2020 in the most recent Annual Report on the Space Command and Control Program (“Space C2”) report dated July 2020.

Colorado Circle ,,Denver,Colorado,80231-2924,"To respond efficiently to pandemics and disease outbreaks, the healthcare system requires efficient packaging and shipping processes for temperature-sensitive research materials and treatments. The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 50% of vaccines are wasted globally every year due to temperature control, logistics and shipment-related issues. The global biopharma industry loses about $35 billion annually as a result of failures in temperature-controlled logistics. The cost of cold chain maintenance for biotherapeutics was US$8.4B in 2015, nearly doubled to US$16B in 2019 and is expected to reach $21.3 billion by 2024. About $5 billion will go toward packaging costs . Remedial solutions exist such as wet/dry ice carriage, storage in stationary or portable refrigeration systems, and costly electronic monitoring of shipments. However, it has been reported that shipping products on dry ice is associated with a 15-30% product failure rate. To compound the challenges, dry ice can be a serious hazard in enclosed spaces that are not properly ventilated. There are other published technologies that can stabilize non-enveloped (naked) virions, but these technologies are not commercially scalable. There are currently no known scalable technologies that can be used to dry and stabilize enveloped viruses for a meaningful timeframe. In response, Nanoly Bioscience Inc, a start-up materials technology company that was founded by a group of material scientists from the University of Colorado, has developed a low-cost, biocompatible polymer network that will revolutionize biomedical/protein storage, transport and stability. Our proprietary innovation, DynaShield, is a breakthrough excipient that consists of a polymer material that can stabilize research/human samples, vaccines, and other therapeutics utilizing viral vectors, thereby eliminating the need for dry ice or liquid nitrogen during shipping. We have identified the Air Force Research Lab and the AF Medical Services as some of the potential customers for our solution. Our potential primary end-users are the clinical microbiologists and technicians at the USAF School of Aerospace Medicine’s (USAFSAM) Epidemiology Lab, which is the sole clinical reference lab in the USAF and part of the 711th Human Performance Wing at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. The lab focuses on clinical diagnostics, public health testing and force health screening, performing 5,000 to 8,000 tests per week and capable of processing over 2,000 samples per day. Since early March, 2020, the USAFSAM’s Epidemiology Lab has tested and processed over 130,000 COVID-19 samples, which constitutes 17% of all samples that have been tested across the DoD .

The three keys to our network will be 1) protection circuitry that powers down key components to protect against intense radiation and EMP, 2) an electrically readout sensor that retains critical radiation level information, and 3) a network that reassembles to make that information available to command as well as in-theater personnel. eVader offers: Smart circuitry which causes devices to power-down during dangerous energy and radiation spikes (while still gathering data) Stationary nodes combine with rugged handhelds to produce a real-time threat map. Airmen will have radiation information on the ground, while command and control (C2) units will be able to make response plans from a bird’s eye view.  Low power draw maximizes battery life (battery shelf life is ten years). The device allows resilient information sharing and rapid, effective decision-making.  ",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Paul  Reynolds,,(505) 379-6504,plgrynlds@gmail.com,,  ,

RSA’s partner company, Howe Industries, is currently investigating a thermal capacitor for use on smallsats, as shown in Figure 1. To increase the power channeled to the thermal capacitor and reduce the charging time, RSA will develop a large unfoldable reflector that will be coupled to the propulsion system. This large reflector will be able to steer large amounts of solar radiation to the thermal capacitor which then allows for ~3000K of thrust and will be designed to also conduct/intercept communications. The Ruby Sky effort led by RSA is developing a similar optical-grade mirror for use in hypersonic detection and will expand on past research performed at the Marshall Space Flight Center as shown in Figure 2. RSA believes that SCORPIUS would provide high operational value to USSF by providing the same rapid redeployment and long mission endurance of the DRACO program without the risks associated with nuclear power.   The SCORPIUS propulsion system operates by selectively transmitting different wavelengths of light incident from the sun’s solar rays. The infrared light is reflected, and the visible and UV spectra are allowed to pass through the optical system. The thermal capacitor absorbs these wavelengths and raises in temperature. However, it is unable to reject heat in the IR spectrum because of this series of filters and must continue to increase in temperature. In doing so, it melts a phase change material dispersed in the graphite matrix to store energy. Once reaching high temperatures, a working fluid enters the capacitor to extract the heat and propel the spacecraft.   When performing sustained ?V burns the temperature of the core will decrease quickly if a solid thermal capacitor is used, resulting in large performance difference between the beginning of the firing and end of firing. Using a material that can store large amounts of heat and maintain high temperatures is paramount in having an effective warm gas thruster. Thus, the SCORPIUS propulsion system uses a phase change material (PCM) contained within a graphite or tungsten casing. PCMs require latent heat energy to conduct phase changes. This is an ideal solution, as the phase change material sustains a high temperature for a long duration burn. Past work by NASA has investigated suitable materials for a PCM as shown in Table 2 (English 1986). Although the study in question did not extend their research to the high temperatures desired, an initial materials search revealed that both elemental boron and beryllium oxide have melting temperatures above 2500K and a heat of fusion above 2500J/g. This Phase II effort will expand on work previously performed to find an optimal PCM with a high heat of fusion and melting temperature.",Thomas  McNitt,,(310) 653-9488,thomas.mcnitt.2@us.af.mil,William  Rideout,,(423) 972-2519,beau.rideout@rheaspaceactivity.com,,  ,

PfSPZ Vaccine, supported in clinical development by the International PfSPZ Consortium, is on track to be the
first US FDA-licensed vaccine against malaria or any human parasitic disease. The vaccine has been safe,
well tolerated, and protective against homologous (same strain) and heterologous (different strains) of
Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria in 19 clinical trials in 11 countries. To date, 80–100% vaccine efficacy (VE)
has been shown against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI), VE that has been demonstrated for at
least 8 months against heterologous and 14 months against CHMI, and at least 18 months sustained VE
against intense transmission of heterogeneous strains of Pf in Burkina Faso with a 3-dose regimen. Trials in
Mali, Equatorial Guinea, and Germany have established optimized regimens in preparation for Phase 3 clinical
trials starting in Q1 2021, which will support a Biologics License Application to the FDA in 2022. PfSPZ
Vaccine is composed of radiation-attenuated, aseptic, purified, cryopreserved Pf sporozoites (SPZ). The
PfSPZ are produced in mosquitoes, and attenuated by -irradiation from a 60Co source while in the mosquitoes’
salivary glands. Our goals are to convert to irradiation of extracted, purified, PfSPZ in a suspension termed
vaccine bulk product (VBP) and to convert the PfSPZ attenuation process from -irradiation to X-irradiation.
Real-time ionization chamber dosimetry will be introduced to monitor dose administration and to ensure
attenuation. These three major changes to the process of attenuation will increase efficiency of manufacturing
and decrease the vaccine cost by: 1) allowing for fewer irradiation events of higher numbers of PfSPZ in
smaller volumes, 2) bringing the irradiation process inside the clean room facility; 3) eliminating costly 60Co-
related expenses, training, and security concerns, and 4) provide a more scalable process for mass vaccine
production. It will also establish a method suitable for attenuating in vitro-generated PfSPZ that are planned to
replace mosquito-produced PfSPZ in the next 4 years. X-irradiation was the method used in the 1967 proof of
principle studies demonstrating that attenuated rodent malaria SPZ could protect mice against malaria.
Subsequent studies adopted -irradiation for attenuation because this method was, at the time more accurate
and replicable. However, X-ray technology has vastly improved, and the benefits of X-ray attenuation make
this approach much superior to -irradiation. As Sanaria further scales up GMP manufacturing, plans to build
manufacturing plants in Africa and Asia, and aims to integrate in vitro-produced PfSPZ into PfSPZ Vaccine,
irradiation will optimally occur with the PfSPZ in liquid suspension as VBP. Inherently, X-irradiation is far more
efficient, amenable to scale up and cost effective than 60Co-irradiation. Three Specific Aims outline the work to
be performed: 1) Define the parameters to irradiate Vaccine Bulk Product liquid suspensions; 2) Determine the
minimal dose of X-irradiation required to completely attenuate PfSPZ; 3) Develop the use of ionization
chamber dosimetry for real-time monitoring of irradiation dose.",  ,,,,ERIC R JAMES,,(240) 403-2725,ejames@sanaria.com,,  ,

A useful rule of thumb to fit a task to ML is: could a human do this in under a second? When designing a classifier, for example, decisions need to be made such as: (1) Which classes should be included? (2) What metrics should be utilized to train and evaluate the classifier; should we emphasize some classes at the expense of others? (3) How do the classes relate to one another? (4) Might a given document fall legitimately into more than one of these classes? (5) How obtainable is training data that aligns to these classes? (6) How will low-confidence predictions or potential latent, novel classes be handled? (7) And most importantly: does this classifier correspond directly to a specific problem, or does a more complex system need to be composed utilizing this classifier as one coordinated component among many? Jaxon’s commercial platform utilizes (manually-created) problem specifications to great success for framing the creation of training datasets and their derived ML models. Despite impressive advances in automation with respect to training individual models, this process of specifying a cooperative set of models to address a mission objective or specific problem is still a painstakingly manual one. Data scientists and data analysts spend copious effort and time designing useful systems and experiments - and must frequently revise them as the mission and/or data contexts change. Furthermore, the prototype code is often wasted as it is not reusable.  Jaxon will develop an automated system AutoSpec that will analyze a collection of datasets (optionally with guidance around domains of interest) and propose candidate ML solution specifications. These specifications consist of detailed descriptions of ML models, as well as a graph linking the cooperative application of multiple models in order to compose a system that addresses a high-level problem utilizing these fine-grained models as building blocks.

Power scavenging extends the usability indefinitely, while remote monitoring largely prevents inadvertent full discharge.  Pack Power™ augments and selectively replaces manpack BB-2590 batteries as well as custom chargers equating to less load and complexity, shortened mission preparation and easier dismounted movement.   The goal of this SBIR Phase I: is to investigate the feasibility and associated costs of ruggedizing existing commercial grade Pack Power Unit by re-packaging it to meet the requirements of and be certified to IP67, MIL-STD 810, MIL-STD 461 and MIL-STD 1275, along with DO160. This will allow this multi-use Handheld Autonomous Power Pack to be deployed in the harsh environments that SOCOM operates in extending down-range mission operational time while reducing rucksack weight, giving the Special Operators technological advantage when operating at the tactical edge.  Pack Power™ will also increase the portability of C3I missions and flight-line maintenance/sustainment diagnostic-equipment required for aircraft repair. The Acumentrics Pack-Power™ addresses a lack of compact, easy-to-use portable power by providing complete power autonomy: The ability to operate anywhere in the absence of external power.  More than just a battery, it is a full featured small form factor rugged UPS (uninterruptible power supply). ",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,David  Ponte,,(508) 612-2935,dponte@acumentrics.com,,  ,

Traditional design efforts for large complex systems rely heavily on deterministic methods to approach safety, reliability and maintainability. This results in a damage-tolerant or fail-safe design approach with frequent preventative maintenance built-in, leading to decreased performance and increased system downtime. With the evolving need for high performance and efficient systems, the application of probabilistic methods using analytical tools for predicting reliability and maintainability is the best solution for advancing the design process. The issue with most system engineer approaches for characterizing system availability is the scope of the effort resulting from the complexity of system. Therefore, MBSE offers an efficient approach to managing the many facets of Design for Availability. G2 Ops have demonstrated the potential benefits of utilizing MBSE to support Reliability Management through the automation of Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) and System Reliability Predictions. Through this approach, it is possible to generate the necessary analyses to adequately assess the current system design and make quantifiable improvement to reliability. With the understanding of how and when components fail, MBSE can be leveraged even further to support critical maintainability decisions. With the use of maintenance modeling, component-level mean time to repair (MTTR) can be analyzed to assess the efficacy of current preventative and corrective maintenance actions. This provides critical insight into the logistics of maintaining the system and how to mitigate downtime. Through the automation of these reliability and maintainability analyses, it is possible to evaluate the system’s operational availability. With the goal of improving system availability, G2 Ops has an integrated MBSE change management tool which allows for the analysis of the effects of prospective design changes on the predicted availability of the system. Through the automated RMA analyses provided by the MBSE environment, it is possible to achieve a higher fidelity and more efficient approach to managing system RMA performance.  ",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Jordan  Suls,,(858) 256-4578,jordan.suls@g2-ops.com,,  ,

Increased space domain awareness (SDA) and maneuverability offer benefits that may mitigate certain adversarial strategies, at a relatively small cost to overall size, weight and power. The trajectories of space assets in Earth orbits are largely determined by launch conditions but can be modified at the expense of delta-v. Additionally, a kinetic attack from the ground or adversarial spacecraft requires that the two objects must be near the same location in space at the same time. Because of these two facts, kinetic attacks from the ground or from an adversarial spacecraft are severely constrained by physics and this information can be used to focus SDA coverage. This also implies that agents with more alert SDA and more precise maneuverability capabilities can impose unfavorable conditions on their targets or pursuers, as they can better assess possible intent given observed behaviors and react appropriately to create penalties in position, phasing, or required delta-v.   For the most complex operations, modern space-based platforms require onboard imaging systems to detect, track, and navigate relative to other spacecraft with high precision. Under this development Astrobotic Technology, Inc. and Arizona State University will design an optical sensor that aims to improve SDA provided by space-based platforms and is also likely to offer notable performance benefits for reliable, on-orbit, GPS-denied navigation that powers maneuver sequences needed for satellite servicing and similar operations. The proposed sensor, RetiNav, combines computational imaging algorithms similar to methods used in consumer mobile devices, along with event camera sensor technology, and efficient space-grade computing. Event cameras are bio-inspired passive imaging sensors that measure changes in light intensity asynchronously using independent pixels. They generate streams of binary responses for each pixel when it experiences an intensity change. The high sensitivity and low power requirements will make RetiNav especially well-suited for imaging in HDR environments and in SWaP-constrained systems. Our approach will fuse high performance-per-watt embedded computing with a balance of past and contemporary algorithms and machine learning models to provide low latency, robust system-level processing. The proposed RetiNav sensor development focuses on the interaction of the sensor and neural network for processing events and establishing the feasibility of this processing on space-relevant computing hardware. We believe it has the potential to offer unique advantages for SDA and GPS-denied navigation in commercial and government space systems as a dual-use technology, as described in the 2020 Defense Space Strategy Summary.",Thomas  McNitt,,(310) 653-9488,thomas.mcnitt.2@us.af.mil,Andrew  Horchler,,(412) 682-3282,andrew.horchler@astrobotic.com,,  ,

The challenge with maintaining stable glucose levels is knowing an individual’s glucose, and how to apply different strategies to suit our individual bodies. Low glucose levels lead to fatigue, low energy, weakness, depression, anxiety, nervousness, and consequently lack of focus. High glucose levels lead to fatigue, dehydration, vomiting, nausea, and consequently lack of focus. Rapidly alternating between high and low glucose levels (glucose spikes as a result of constant high carbohydrate intake) results in sluggishness, frequent urination, increased thirst, and headaches.",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Sharam  Fouladgar-Mercer,,(650) 268-4504,sharam@signos.com,,  ,

A significant problem, yet to be addressed in the current design of knee braces, are the number of people that experience performance limitations while braced. Most knee brace frames incorporate standard bilateral, polycentric hinges which provide a stabilizing force to the flexion and extension of the knee.  While this method attempts to mimic the joint’s natural movement, it falls short in allowing the knee the ability to internally and externally rotate.  During the last 30° of extension, the tibia or femur must externally or internally rotate, approximately 10°. While this rotation may seem small, it remains essential for healthy motion of the knee and maximal performance.  Rotation must occur to achieve full flexion and extension. If the tibia or femur is held in a fixed position, this can alter the mechanics of the knee and lead to an increased chance of injury. By eliminating the joint’s ability to rotate, the brace begins to fight against the joint’s true motion, decreasing the ability of the athlete to move with fluidity and increasing the risk of brace migration and injury.  Military personnel have suggested that the current knee braces are bulky and difficult to wear underneath their uniform and lead to a loss of performance. This technology seeks to significantly reduce migration, increase comfort, provide customizable sizing, and ultimately allow for optimal performance.",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Regan  Curtiss,,(402) 680-5828,regan.curtiss@aryse.com,,  ,

This technical innovation is a generic digital model of Phase-based Vaccination Tracking and Efficacy Assessment (PVac) Pathways to enable implementation of effective toolsets to track, monitor, and predict the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination distribution systems and the efficacy and durability of vaccines. Moreover, the same Modeling and Simulation (M&S) framework, once verified, will be applicable to interventions in other applicable use cases for prevalent diseases such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, childhood obesity, military infectious diseases, psychological health/traumatic brain Injury, and combat related rehabilitation. The resulting model will establish a firm mathematical system-theoretic foundation for model-based systems engineering design and implementation of public health-threatening disease management strategies. RTSimPA will be based on the existing RTSync-owned Modeling and Simulation environment (MS4 Me) based on Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS).  Due to its universality of realization, any real world system, or system of systems (SoS) can be modeled in DEVS and simulated in a compliant computational platform. An optimal health and social service delivery system requires methods to model large scale distributed complex systems, a challenge that has been identified under the rubric of Model-based Systems Engineering in that the optimization cannot be based on sub-optimization of the component systems, but must be directed at the entire system itself. People with multiple health and social needs are high consumers of health care services, and are thus drivers of high health care costs. RTSync extended the framework to include the level of population management that employs risk management and pathways of care to provide coordination at the system of systems level. A generic process was defined in which a patient is inducted into coordinated care with a full-scale screening and assessment of medical, social and behavioral health risks and assignment to one of a small set of categories of risk, each with its own distinct portfolio of interventions and care coordination services. A primary distinction with current practice is that a patient is assigned to single Primary Care Provider (PCP, doctor) and connected care coordination team who are responsible for all subsequent patient interactions with the system.. The PCP team is continually updated with results of the patient’s encounters with such interventions and mitigations of risk through system-provided tracking thus enabling monitoring of progress in addressing modifiable risk.   Using RTSimPA, stakeholders and decision-makers involved in epidemic management can get help in areas of information messaging, training, connectivity, and real time monitoring.",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Bernard  Zeigler,,(520) 220-8811,zeigler@rtsync.com,,  ,

The desired approach would allow for the auto-designer tool to apply structural engineering calculations to verify that structural components are adequately sized. Any alterations to the structure size, column spacing, wall span, etc. would result in a change to the structural component sizing. Additionally, the AF would like the result of the effort to be a software tool that is tied into AFRL’s Endgame Framework, for use in existing weaponeering tools. In Phase I, a framework for a novel auto-designer tool - The Smart Target Design Assist Toolkit (STDAT) - was developed. The core programmatic architecture of STDAT was created in Python and designed to interface with Smart Target Model Generator (STMG) metadata. STDAT offers a powerful, yet expedient multi-degree-of-freedom linear and nonlinear structural analysis and design capability that can be leveraged for 15-minute weaponeering cycles and longer duration special studies. Feasibility of the STDAT framework was demonstrated for the reinforced concrete framed light office building construction type. Two case studies were evaluated: a rectangular and non-rectangular multi-story, multi-bay building model generated in STMG and subjected to a multi-column removal scenario to represent model modifications for a first-story lobby space. For both case studies, STDAT was used to automatically analyze and re-design the modified building model in less than 30 seconds. This Phase II effort aims to expand the STDAT framework, both in terms of new capability and construction types, and execute a phased integration approach into the Endgame Framework (EF) platform. A ""smart"" structural design process will couple both existing/improved STMG rule bases and newly developed structural design functions with a design optimization algorithm that will afford the user with control over how and where the building design is optimized. The STDAT framework will be enhanced to handle generalized lateral load analysis (seismic and wind) and expanded to include three (3) additional construction types: reinforced concrete framed high-rise construction, steel framed construction, and masonry construction. A phased approach will then be taken to fully integrate STDAT into EF. Custom STMG/STDAT import and export utilities will first be developed, to facilitate EF compatibility testing, external module testing, and to offer an STDAT standalone usage mode.

The US Government and DoD share many similar requirements with the Commercial business segments, when it comes to satellite communications (SatCom), those primarily of unit cost, availability, and flexibility.  The USSF has made recent calls for SatCom solutions that offer resilient and affordable capabilities, including: - Overcoming adversaries working to deny, degrade, and destroy the satcom capabilities - Delivering capacity flexibility, terminal, and network agility, with cyber and link security - Management capability to view, synchronize and direct The USSF Vision for SatCom is difficult to envision being achieved with the rigid technologies and architecture of today’s SatCom philosophy. Detraxi has recognized the limitations of the SatCom domain and addresses them via a groundbreaking shift from current deployed architecture.  Today’s SatCom architecture relies on complex and expensive high-performance capabilities in-orbit. But space technology is restricted by its high cost, harsh environment, and inaccessibility.  The supply chain perpetuates the mantra of ‘all things in space’ developing higher priced onboard technology that will not keep pace with increasing user demands. But more importantly they place little emphasis on the ground component and how it is vitally critical of resolving the SatCom limitations. Detraxi resolves this two-fold, by removing the shackles of complex space hardware, and the hardcoded RF gateway infrastructure, via an architecture that enables the transformation to a fully software-defined domain. This is achieved primarily through the power, flexibility, and scalability of Cloud Computing and a virtualized SatCom ecosystem.  Detraxi incorporates a patented architecture that results in a softwarization of the gateway to spacecraft segment, enabling an environment that can deliver the government’s needs via digitized capabilities rather than inflexible stovepiped RF hardware. The essence of the architecture involves moving complex onboard capabilities in space down to the Cloud Computing domain, resulting in lower cost spacecraft asset.  Placing higher order functions into the cloud domain enables an adaptive capability not present in today’s SatCom design.  Placing the heavy lifting activities within the cloud provides advantages which can be unlocked through a Thick-Route Optical Feeder Link to the satellite. Such technology is anticipated to be developed and delivered in the next few years with the European Union currently in the lead. However, the US can be the first to establish and lead virtualized cloud computing satellite R&D.  ",Thomas  McNitt,,(310) 653-9488,thomas.mcnitt.2@us.af.mil,Michael  Spytek,,(727) 560-0216,michael.spytek@detraxi.io,,  ,

The long wavelengths used in these systems limit the directionality and focusing capabilities at extended ranges, reducing the total electromagnetic intensity on target. In contrast, propagation of optical frequencies enables much more concentrated energy deposition, especially with recent advances in adaptive atmospheric compensation. While continuous-wave lasers are the primary optical source of directed energy technology, there is merit in pursuing the capabilities of high-average power, high-peak power pulsed optical sources. Pulsed lasers are capable of delivering localized, tunable, and highly-concentrated RF bursts directly to the target. Their high intensities facilitate plasma generation either on the target itself or in the surrounding media; subsequent modulation of this plasma by following pulses results in controllable RF waveforms, which have been shown to possess single-shot denial of small drones and robust circuit disruption.

LIBRA is based on our mature, technology readiness level (TRL)-7 millimeter wave Luneburg lens antenna design and 3D printing lens manufacture technology. Specifically, the innovation in utilizing state-of-the-art 3D printing to fabricate custom designed, high performance Luneburg lens enables low size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C), up to full 4? solid angle field-of-regard (FoR), broadband and simultaneous multi-beam lens antennas, advantageous over legacy dish antennas or phased array antennas. As a result, LIBRA SATCOM terminals offers an resilient, high throughput, yet quite affordable next-generation tactical terminal that supports high-speed connection and tracking of multiple satellites simultaneously in different orbits, with FoR coverage of full 360° azimuth and zenith to below-horizon elevation. A notional LIBRA terminal will cover multi- military and commercial bands with >30 dB antenna gain, link with >2 satellites in LEO, MEO, or GEO simultaneously, and with key specs such as EIRP, receive gain-to-noise temperature (G/T) and MIL-STD compliance meeting Space Force (SF) requirements. With its large FoR, low SWaP, and absence of mechanically scanning, LIBRA terminal is suitable for deployment on both stationary stations and mobile platforms, such as ground vehicles and aerial systems. In Phase I, Lunewave will design, develop, and demonstrate a lens antenna prototype with Ku/Ka dual bands coverage and antenna performances meeting Space Force Phase I requirements. A satellite terminal system will be designed based on this lens prototype, and a functional Ku (and/or Ka) band SATCOM terminal prototype for proof-of-concept may be demonstrated. A Phase II prototype specifications and system integration requirements will also be defined, with inputs from Space Force stake holders. In Phase II, Lunewave plan to refine the design and further develop the lens antenna and terminal prototype. A Phase II final prototype will demonstrate simultaneous SATCOM connectivity over multiple satellites with enhanced link throughput and resilience, and SWaP-C meeting requirements of targeted SF platforms or user groups. The demonstration will be held in laboratory test settings and potentially in initial field test settings, with Space Force participations.",Thomas  McNitt,,(310) 653-9488,thomas.mcnitt.2@us.af.mil,Ziran  Wu,,(520) 245-6221,ziran@lunewave.com,,  ,

These ground segments have many of the same software vulnerabilities that plague other computer networks. If the ground segment should be breached, the space segment is virtually unprotected. Moreover, given the remoteness of space assets, remote software update and mitigation are very challenging.

Just this year, OneWeb, a commercial broadband company with a constellation of 650 satellites, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, threatening the U.S. Space Force’s access to commercial broadband in the Arctic region. Yet despite this critical dependency on an innovative private company, the US Government had no prior warning of OneWeb’s declining corporate health before its sudden bankruptcy. On the other hand, commercial companies around the globe are driving innovation in strategic fields, such as artificial intelligence (AI), command & control (C2), and space, presenting an opportunity to help the AF maintain its technological edge. Indeed, numerous national security experts have recognized the increasingly central role of the new innovation landscape, including senior Air Force leader Christopher Benson, in his Master’s thesis “Cross-domain comparison of quantitative technology improvement using patent derived characteristics.” The problem, in essence, is the same as that faced by most Fortune 100 companies: survival requires rigorous market intelligence of company-level risks, and industry-level technology trends, around the globe.

Although considered more secure compared to their software counterparts, hardware implementations of crypto algorithms are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks such as side-channel attacks and reverse engineering. It is imperative to equip such hardware crypto modules with higher level of security in mitigating such attacks.  The goal of this project is to develop a polymorphic crypto module, e.g., AES, which is capable of using two sets of keys based on the supply voltage provided by the system. For example, in GF12nm process, if 800mV is provided, the AES module will use key#1 for encryption/decryption; if 450mV is provided, the module will use key#2. When incorporated into an ASIC/SoC, since this supply voltage is internal, attackers do not have access to this information, making their attacks to the crypto module extremely difficult. This module can be incorporated into any ASIC/SoC, e.g., microprocessor, microcontroller, machine learning accelerator, etc., which requires crypto capabilities with high security.  Polymorphic circuits refer to special circuit designs where a fixed CMOS digital circuit is capable of carrying out two or more distinct functions based on changes in the supply voltage. Since these functions are embedded into logic gates, the area is much smaller compared to if all functions are standalone due to the sharing of transistors inside each gate. Unfortunately, the clocked, synchronous polymorphic circuits are impractical to design due to their strict timing requirements. Timing closure is hard enough for modern digital ASICs possessing only one function. Having multiple functions at different supply voltages is a much worse scenario for timing analysis. A timing-robust design paradigm is needed to make polymorphic circuits practical.",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Matthew  Leftwich,,(479) 215-9438,mleftwich@nanomatronix.com,,  ,

Tuberous sclerosis (TS), also called tuberous sclerosis complex, is a rare, multi-systemic genetic and often life-
threatening disease that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys,
heart, eyes, lungs, and skin. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a TS-related tumor-like disorder. Both occur as a
consequence of an inherited or sporadic mutation in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, which function as negative
regulators of the mTOR pathway. Uncontrolled mTORC1 activity leads to the neoplastic proliferation of abnormal
smooth muscle cells (LAM cells) in the lungs, progressive shortness of breath, recurrent pneumothoraxes, and loss of
pulmonary tissue structure and function. TS affects as many as 25,000 to 40,000 individuals in the United States and
about 1 to 2 million individuals worldwide. LAM is a rare disease affecting women in childbearing age. The first and
only FDA-approved treatment for LAM is the immunosuppressant sirolimus (Rapamune©), marketed since 2015 by
Pfizer. It is the current standard-of-care and acts by inhibiting mTORC1. Sirolimus has several clinical disadvantages,
including a considerable number of non-responders, severe adverse events due to its immunosuppressive properties
and pregnancy category C, limiting its use in women of childbearing age. Thus, there is a high unmet medical need to
develop alternative and safer treatment options for LAM and TS.
We have identified Nitazoxanide (hereafter NTZ; Alinia©), an antiprotozoal FDA-approved and safe therapy for the
treatment of diarrhea caused by Giardia lamblia or Cryptosporidium parvum in patients 1 year of age or older, as a
potential novel therapy for LAM/TS. Using Capture Compound Mass Spectrometry technology, we discovered
NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) as the human target of Nitazoxanide. Furthermore, we have shown that
NTZ is effective in inhibiting mTORC1 related cellular signaling in three different LAM related murine and human cell
lines addressing the underlying pathological mechanism of LAM/TS.
Our goal for this grant is the investigation of NTZ’s efficacy for the treatment of LAM/TS. Aim 1 will be the in vivo proof
of concept comparing three dose levels of NTZ in a TSC2-null murine model developed at the laboratory of Prof.
Krymskaya at the University of Pennsylvania. It will evaluate prevention of TSC2-null lesion growth,
immunohistochemical and lung morphology changes and animal survival in a murine LAM model.
Aim 2 will cover an in vitro study, investigating underlying cellular effects on mTOR and related signaling pathways.
The in vitro study will investigate NTZandapos;s effects in LAM-derived AML (LAMD) cells and immortalized TSC2-null cell
cultures of human origin followed by more detailed mTORC1 interactions studies. In addition to the monotherapeutic
NTZ approach, dose reduction potential for dose-toxicity prone rapamycine with NTZ add-on will be explored.
This project aims to develop a novel therapy for patients with the devastating diseases of LAM/TS. Based on NTZandapos;s
excellent safety profile as an approved antiprotozoal drug, positive efficacy results in our studies would enable an
accelerated clinical development under FDA section 505 (2)(b) approval pathway and orphan disease designation.Project Narrative
Pulmonary Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and Tuberous sclerosis (TS) are multi-system and often
life-threatening genetic diseases affecting thousands of people in the United States and approximately
1 million worldwide. We identified the human molecular target of the antiparasitic FDA-approved
therapeutic nitazoxanide, which may provide a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of LAM and
TS. Our proposed in vivo and in vitro mechanistic research will investigate nitazoxanide as a novel
monotherapy in a LAM mouse model and human cell cultures to validate our hypothesis and take the
first step to fast-track nitazoxanide’s development for its clinical use in LAM and TS.",  ,,,,DIRK  PLEIMES,,(646) 455-8495,dirk.pleimes@biosputnik.org,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,  ,

Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a novel intelligent data browser that will enable
medicinal chemists developing new drug compounds to more efficiently browse and organize experimental
data in an intuitive way. The proposed browser will essentially “hyperlink” chemical space and allow chemists
to navigate easily among compounds in a chemical lead series following the same pathways that lead from one
compound to the next in the mental models that they intuitively map in their heads. Navigating through and
extending a lead series to discover the optimal drug candidate to advance into animal studies and clinical trials
comprises a critical stage of the drug discovery pipeline: the success of large subsequent investments depends
on making the right decision. This stage also especially emphasizes creative and intuitive thinking. Existing
software that assists scientists engaged in this task tabulates data in formats that make it difficult to assemble
and compare the essential data needed to rapidly explore ideas about how to further optimize promising
candidates. Our proposed intelligent browser will support more natural and intuitive workflows.A key enabling innovation for this technology is a methodology that we have developed to organize
molecular structures through a partial ordering based on the substructure-superstructure relation as a Hasse
diagram. Our semilattice representation provides a machine computable format that can capture the
relationships among related chemical entities that a medicinal chemist intuits.Expected key impacts include (1) faster development of lead series into drug candidates, (2) cost savings due
to more efficient use of synthesis and assay resources, and most importantly (3) better scientific decisions
about which compounds to pursue and advance into the clinical pipeline. Better decisions at this stage in the
drug discovery process should increase the probability that drug candidates that are chosen will successfully
emerge through the clinical pipeline as FDA approved drugs, and improve the effectiveness and safety profile of
those drugs. Even a small increase in these probabilities multiplied by the size of the investments required to
take drugs through clinical trials translates into a large value. We have validated this perception of value in
preliminary market research with potential pharmaceutical company customers.

The sensors provide surveillance information to the DAA trackers which in turn provide the location and velocity of nearby aircraft to the DAA’s alerting and guidance algorithm.  Advanced DAA tracker capabilities, such as those developed by AFRL, can further estimate the traffic’s horizontal turn rate, but cannot reliably predict upcoming turn-ins, roll-outs or changes in vertical profiles.  This limitation is exacerbated when applying DAA in the terminal area where traffic tends to flow in geographically prescribed patterns. Applying the current Transit DAA tracker for departure or arrival operations is expected to lead to elevated nuisance/late alert rates, flow interruptions and decreased safety margin in the terminal area. Arrival and departure traffic tend to follow patterns. These patterns are embedded in historical data which can be analyzed and extracted to improve DAA tracker prediction of future aircraft location and intent in terminal areas. As such, Bihrle Applied Research (BAR), proposes the use of machine learning to extract these embedded patterns to enhance and provide aircraft intent to tracker outputs. The DAA Tracker Augmentation (DAATA) system will take current tracker outputs, assess these outputs with respect to historical data, statistical modeling of the terminal airspace, and known terminal airspace procedures, and provide enhance DAA alerting and guidance to CA systems and AVOs. By design, DAATA will be sensor, tracker, and CA system agnostic, therefore applicable in a variety of deployment scenarios. BAR anticipates that there is enough underlying structure in the terminal airspace trajectory data to both categorize the aircraft trajectories as arrivals, departures, or transits, and predict where the aircraft will be in the future with an accompanying probability of accuracy. The structure in the data content that is expected is related to the procedures for arrivals and departures. Because of this, it is anticipated that a machine learning model will need to be trained for every deployment scenario and to be regularly updated as arrival and departure procedures change.  However, it is anticipated that the machine learned categorization will be agnostic to deployment scenarios as it is examining the overall shape of the aircraft trajectory and not predicting positions in time.  While this effort is focused on the development of DAATA for terminal areas, DAATA technologies can be applied to other situations and use cases.

Liv Labs has developed a novel, reusable, self-administered silicone pessary for patient-controlled treatment of
female stress urinary incontinence (SUI), a bothersome condition that affects some 27 million American women
over the age of 25. Unlike the fitted and disposable pessaries available on the market today, this patent-
pending Soft Spring Continence Pessary is a symmetrical, hollow, resilient form placed above the pelvic floor—
not to kink the urethra, as other effective devices and surgical procedures do, but rather to gently compress the
urethra through soft, vaginal tissue. The device compresses down into a 10mm cylinder for applicator-assisted
insertion and features an integrated finger loop for easy manual removal. Comprising only soft, rounded
surfaces, the spring pessary can be lubricated and is intended for patients with vaginal atrophy who sometimes
experience pain, lacerations, or injury with existing devices. The Liv Labs team has already completed bench
testing, focus groups, caregiver assessments, design review with clinicians, and a two-week, IRB-approved,
pilot feasibility study with nine symptomatic women. Directional efficacy and safety were reported, as well as
high user satisfaction. During Phase II, Liv Labs will ensure the pessary meets all requirements for pre-clinical
design validation. Output will include engineering specifications and drawings; quality system framework; risk
assessment; and results for biocompatibility, toxicity, and forces testing. First a controlled, single-use human
factors study will be held to confirm safe and accurate device use (Aim 1). Then a single-arm, open label,
interventional efficacy study will be conducted at Northwestern University’s Integrated Pelvic Health Program
Clinic (Aim 2). The study will enroll 50 women diagnosed with SUI by means of an in-clinic Cough Stress Test.
Enrolled patients will participate in an 17-day pad weight test, to confirm device efficacy. Upon completion of
evaluative questionnaires, the same participants will then immediately enter a prospective, descriptive study of
patient-managed device use for a period of six months (Aim 3). The team at Liv Labs comprises late-career
product developers with experience inventing medical devices and software, branded consumer products and
services, and technology-enabled, proactive care models for aging in place. The team is closely advised by a
panel of practicing urogynecologists and OB/GYNs. The extended development team has collaborated closely
with Liv Labs for three years and includes top-tier consultants in engineering, manufacturing, quality systems,
clinical testing and regulatory strategy. Once commercialized, the first-ever Soft Spring Continence Pessary will
provide millions of women, from all walks of life, a practical, affordable way to self-treat their SUI symptoms
and increase their inclination toward fitness.",  ,,,,MELODY A ROBERTS,,(630) 373-1471,melody@liv-labs.com,,  ,

These types of hemorrhages result from bleeding that cannot be controlled with a tourniquet or application of direct pressure. Additionally, within the civilian US sectors, bleeding from trauma creates a significant death toll among survivable injuries.   With the advent of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) lives are now being saved. However, the current form of REBOA creates a full blockage of blood flow, resulting rapidly in organ damage distal to the occlusion balloon. In addition to such severe tissue ischemia, there is possibility of metabolic derangements upon reperfusion. New research has led to the opportunity to create partial blockage to extend the survival window by allowing a minimal amount of blood past the balloon and mitigate the ischemia-reperfusion metabolic injury. Currently, no device exists that can perform this ""partial REBOA"" automatically, thus trauma clinicians and medics must manually manipulate the device and guess at the amount of blood to allow past the occlusion. While REBOA has been recognized as a breakthrough procedure for saving lives, recent research on the clinical impact of REBOA has led to several observations that highlight the limitations of the current protocol and give rise to need for further development, training, and education. These findings provide evidence of the need for a more automated system that will create better opportunity for use in trauma scenarios as well as make the procedure more widely available to medics and first responders.    Hence, the requirement identified and opportunity created for Autonomous Healthcare is to automate the procedure through the use of a feedback control system and an accompanying balloon integrated with pressure sensors to further facilitate the deployment of this technology.      We propose to develop an automated hemorrhage control and resuscitation technology to be used at the point of injury. The technology includes a closed-loop algorithm embedded in a compact (credit card-sized) computing device that continuously receives invasive blood pressure data from a custom integrated catheter/balloon/sensor. The computing device computes the required occlusion balloon inflation to regulate aortic blood flow to a desired value set by the clinical user. The inflation/deflation is performed automatically by a computer-controlled infuse/withdraw syringe pump connected to the computing device.",Jean Paul N Chretien,program manager,(703) 526-2053,jean-paul.chretien@darpa.mil,Behnood  Gholami,,(678) 886-6400,bgholami@aretexeng.com,,  ,

Approximately 4% of people in the US are either deaf or hard of hearing, equating to more than 13 million people.
Of these, approximately 12 million people over the age of 5 years have difficulty hearing normal conversation
even when using a hearing aid. Hearing difficulties affect all age groups and present significant challenges in
daily life. These challenges are particularly acute in healthcare settings, where miscommunication results in
suboptimal treatment and can lead to serious and potentially life-threatening outcomes for patients. Errors in
interpersonal communication are an important contributing factor in medical errors, and the wearing of surgical
masks by healthcare personnel and patients increases the likelihood of miscommunication. The surgical mask
is an essential item of personal protective equipment, preventing the transmission of infectious agents such as
bacteria and viruses, but conventional surgical masks can muffle speech and prevent patients and healthcare
workers with hearing difficulties from being able to lip read. Lip reading is an important visual aid to
communication for everyone but is particularly important for those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Our goal is
to complete the development of a transparent surgical N95 respirator mask that prevents infectious disease
transmission and improves communication among healthcare personnel and patients with hearing impairment.
In Phase I, we successfully developed and tested a prototype surgical N95 respirator mask with a transparent
window that enables patients and healthcare workers to see each other’s lips while maintaining the protective
barrier function of the mask. A collaborative study with Dr. Sam Atcherson of the Department of Audiology and
Speech Pathology at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock validated the mask as a visual aid, showing that
groups with either moderate or severe-to-profound hearing loss benefitted from the visual input from the
prototype mask. The patented FaceView Mask™ combines the transparent window with both N95 filtration
capability and a unique antimicrobial coating to kill bacteria. In Phase II, we propose to optimize the mask design,
establish a scalable production process, and conduct further testing to support 510(k) clearance, NIOSH
approval, and commercialization of the FaceView Mask™ surgical N95 respirator. Specifically, we will 1) optimize
the FaceView Mask™ and conduct a survey study with end users to ensure comfort and an effective seal around
the airways; 2) conduct comparative product testing with healthcare professionals, including American Sign
Language interpreters to gather their perceptions of the FaceView Mask™ vs. a leading opaque surgical N95
respirator mask; 3) perform testing required for 510(k) clearance and NIOSH approval of the FaceView Mask™;
and 4) test its antimicrobial performance both in a standard laboratory test and in use by healthcare workers.PROJECT NARRATIVE

MINOTAUR applies decades of empirical research and expertise from our team in minimalist spatial haptics to the design of two distinct haptic cueing and alerting profiles to support: (1) land navigation (i.e., cueing Operators to waypoints, POIs, AOIs); and (2) threat alerting and localization. These haptics cueing profiles will be implemented using a custom haptic actuator configuration as an enhancement to Pison’s proven (TRL7-8) GAMBIT wrist-worn wearable (which enables gesture control of digital systems). Phase I will validate MINOTAUR’s feasibility, via access to end-users from our AFSW MOU signatories, through hands-on technology demonstrations that are made possible by our existing wearable form factor and haptic experimentation prototype test rigs. Working MINOTAUR's intended end users, we will identify promising haptic cueing profiles, and establish requirements for a full-scope MINOTAUR system to serve as a Phase II foundation. MINOTAUR’s haptic cueing capabilities will improve Special Operator situational awareness, while preserving lethality and survivability by promoting heads-up, eyes-out, ears-open, and weapon-ready mission execution. By providing intuitive and resolved haptic cues informed by battlefield ATAK data, Special Operators will be able to better maintain mission focus and reduce decision times for tasks such as land navigation / maneuvers and threat prioritization and response / COA selection. To further mitigate risk of Phase II execution, we will also plan and secure IRB approval to conduct human subjects research in Phase II, which will focus on quantifying the anticipated benefits of MINOTAUR technology under ecologically representative operating conditions. The overall result of the proposed Phase I effort will therefore be a set of established requirements and approved human testing plan to validate the performance of a full-scope MINOTAUR system informed by Phase I feasibility testing.

Many cancers are recognized to have an inflammatory etiology. Gastric cancer, the third leading cause of cancer
deaths worldwide, is the prototype- it is caused by infection with the bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori in
90% of cases. For colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths, inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) is a frequent precursor lesion. This STTR Phase I proposal is a partnership between the Wilson
Lab at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), which is focused on gastrointestinal inflammation-
associated carcinogenesis, and MTI BioTech, Inc. (MTI), who are together developing a new therapeutic strategy
to prevent cancer. Under conditions of chronic mucosal inflammation, increased enzyme activities result in
formation of dicarbonyl electrophiles, products of lipid peroxidation that include isolevuglandins (isoLGs),
malondialdehyde, 4-oxo-nonenal, and acrolein, all of which can form adducts with DNA, histones, and proteins.
This adduct formation may lead to somatic genomic abnormalities and risk for neoplastic transformation. The
compound 2-hydroxybenzylamine (2-HOBA) can serve as a scavenger of all electrophiles, thus preventing
adduct formation. 2-HOBA is a natural product derived from buckwheat seeds. It has been shown to be highly
bioavailable, with no toxicity, in rodents and in recent human Phase I clinical trials. 2-HOBA protects mice from
oxidative damage in models of hypertension and Alzheimer’s disease. The Wilson Lab has discovered that isoLG
adducts are increased i) in gastric tissues of patients and mice infected with H. pylori; ii) in the colon of humans
with chronic colitis from inflammatory bowel disease, and colitis-associated cancer (CAC), and mice treated with
azoxymethane-dextran sulfate sodium (AOM-DSS), a model of CAC. The Lab has found that a 2-HOBA analog,
EtHOBA, which also scavenges electrophiles, markedly reduces gastric dysplasia and carcinoma in two models
of H. pylori-induced gastric carcinoma, transgenic FVB/N insulin-gastrin (INS-GAS) mice and Mongolian gerbils,
and reduces colonic tumorigenesis in the AOM-DSS CAC model. However, unlike 2-HOBA, EtHOBA has not
reached development for human use. We hypothesize that electrophiles have a key role in inflammation-driven
gastrointestinal carcinogenesis via formation of adducts to macromolecules and are new molecular targets for
cancer prevention by 2-HOBA. We will determine the protective effect of 2-HOBA on H. pylori-induced gastric
carcinogenesis in INS-GAS mice and gerbils (Aim 1) and on colitis-associated carcinogenesis in the AOM-DSS
mouse model (Aim 2). Primary endpoints will be reduction in dysplasia, carcinoma, and tumor formation, and
secondary endpoints will be effects on DNA damage and isoLG adducts. A successful STTR Phase I outcome
will be a protective effect of 2-HOBA on gastric and colon carcinogenesis and will be the primary go/no go
endpoint to a Phase II STTR project. We envision future studies testing 2-HOBA in animals in which disease is
already fully established; further assessment of molecular mechanisms underlying protective effects, including
in human organoids; and human clinical trials in patients with precancerous gastric and colon lesions.NARRATIVE:
Many human cancers are caused by chronic inflammation, and this is especially true in the gastrointestinal tract,
where most cases of stomach cancer are caused by a bacterial infection with Helicobacter pylori and colorectal
cancer is often caused by inflammatory bowel disease, due to colitis-associated carcinogenesis. Our data
implicate a novel pathway for gastrointestinal cancer development due to oxidative injurious agents called
electrophiles, and we hypothesize that removing these electrophiles with 2-hydroxybenzylamine (2-HOBA), a
natural product from buckwheat seeds, will reduce development of stomach and colon cancer in rodent models.
This Phase I partnership between MTI BioTech, Inc. (MTI), the developer of 2-HOBA for future commercial use,
and the Wilson Lab at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where the animal experiments and subsequent
analyses will be conducted, is expected to provide essential preclinical data needed for future Phase II studies
with 2-HOBA defining molecular mechanisms of protection and for human clinical trials in patients at high risk
for inflammation-induced stomach and colorectal cancer.",  ,,,,JOHN A RATHMACHER,,(515) 296-9916,rathmacher@mti-hmb.com,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,  ,

The prevalence of asthma in the United States is approximately 8% (andgt;25 million people). In African Americans,
the prevalence is andgt;11%. A majority of asthma sufferers are sensitized to allergens, including those shed in the
feces, saliva, and exuviae of cockroaches. Thus, exposure to cockroach infestation is recognized as both a
significant risk factor for the development of allergic asthma and a potent trigger of asthma attacks. The
asthma risk from cockroach exposure is particularly high in inner-city residences where elevated levels of
cockroach allergens are common. For example, some studies have shown that cockroach allergens are found
at high concentrations associated with asthma in andgt;45% of high-rise apartments in the U.S., and andgt;60% of
asthmatic children in U.S. inner cities are sensitized to cockroach allergens. Treating active cockroach
infestations can significantly reduce allergen levels within structures and is one strategy to improve asthma
symptoms that is recommended by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Board. The German
cockroach, Blatella germanica, is the most widespread and problematic cockroach pest in urban environments.
The use of insecticidal baits has traditionally been the most effective method for control of this species.
However, the spread of insecticide resistance across populations of B. germanica can reduce the efficacy of
insecticidal interventions, creating a need for improved tools. Our research team recently reported that the gut
microbiota contributes to insecticide resistance in B. germanica. We also found that disrupting the gut
microbiota decreases reproductive fitness. Accordingly, we predict that targeting the microbiota of German
cockroaches by incorporating antibacterial metal oxide nanoparticles into insecticidal bait formulations could be
an effective strategy to improve control of insecticide-resistant infestations in the field. We propose three
specific aims to test the viability of this approach against cockroaches resistant to diverse insecticides using
two types of metal oxide nanoparticles with known antibacterial properties (ZnO and CuO). In aim 1, we will
determine if antibacterial nanoparticles can increase the efficacy of several commonly used bait insecticides
against resistant cockroach strains. In aim 2, we will determine if antibacterial nanoparticles in bait can
adversely affect cockroach life history. In aim 3, we will determine if nanoparticle-insecticide combination baits
can eliminate resistant cockroach populations under semi-field conditions. It is expected that the results of our
work will inform the development of novel insecticidal bait formulations to mitigate insecticide resistance and
improve cockroach control, which has been demonstrated to reduce asthma morbidity and improve outcomes
in human populations.STATEMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE
There is a clear relationship between exposure to cockroach allergens and allergic asthma morbidity in both
children and adults. Prior studies have established that interventions to reduce cockroach allergen levels,
particularly insecticidal treatments that decrease cockroach populations, can significantly reduce morbidity and
improve outcomes in asthma sufferers. Results from our work will enhance the efficacy of insecticidal
formulations for more efficient control of cockroach infestations, thereby directly reducing cockroach-
associated health risks and improving environmental hygiene in human homes.",  ,,,,JOSE E PIETRI,,(605) 658-6391,jepietri@ucdavis.edu,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH DAKOTA,  ,

The World Health Organization estimates that each year influenza causes serious illness in 3 to 5 million
people and up to 650,000 deaths globally. While seasonal vaccines to prevent influenza infection are available,
frequent mutations in the virus require manufacturers to guess which strains will circulate each season and
reformulate the vaccine annually. As a result, the public health benefit of seasonal vaccines is hampered by
poor efficacy (estimated at 36% for the 2017-18 season). This challenge highlights the critical need to improve
influenza vaccines to boost humoral responses (onset, magnitude, and breadth) and generate additional
cellular immunity. Our technology focuses on engineering the sustained release of seasonal influenza vaccine
antigen to mimic natural infection kinetics over 2 weeks, resulting in greater diversity of anti-influenza
antibodies and improved T cell responses. This is accomplished using silk fibroin biomaterial in a microneedle
array format that can be easily administered to the skin. After a brief 5 minute wear time, the silk microneedle
tips are released from the patch and implanted within the dermis. These silk tips are engineered to stabilize
vaccine antigens at body temperature while slowly releasing the antigen payload over 2 weeks. In animal
studies comparing conventional injection to our sustained release approach, we demonstrated a 4-fold
increase in protective T-cells, a 5-fold increase in antibody titers, and significantly higher survival following
lethal challenge. Patch administration was also well tolerated in dermatological models (hairless guinea pigs
and yorkshire swine). Building upon these preclinical proof-of-concept results, the objective of our proposed
work is to prepare for clinical translation and commercialization of this technology through implementation of a
Quality Management System, optimization and finalization of device design, establishment of GMP
manufacturing and other CMC-related activities, and regulatory engagement to ensure compliance with FDA
requirements. Having completed these aims, Vaxess will be positioned to file an IND and begin a Phase 1
clinical study on a path to commercialization of our microarray patch for broadly protective seasonal influenza

Approaches include parallel single mode (ex. more fibers), multi-level modulation coupled with direct detection (ex. four-level pulse amplitude modulation or PAM-4), and wide channel spacing (i.e. coarse WDM or CWDM). Bandwidth and computing demand is increasing at an unprecedented rate, and power consumption cannot practically scale at this same rate. We propose to avoid or limit complex and power-hungry concepts such as dense WDM (DWDM), optical phase-locked loop (OPLL) based coherent detection, narrow channel spacing, and high Baud rate, and instead leverage an untapped approach to minimize energy consumption, namely Multi core fiber (MCF)-based Space Division Multiplexing (SDM). To further the development of energy efficient integrated photonic networking technologies for datacenters and high performance computing (HPC), we propose to revolutionize chip-to-chip interconnects with massively parallel photonic channels based on photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology and spatial division multiplexing (SDM).Enabling this approach is the world record ultra-low loss Silicon Photonics (SiPh)-compatible silicon nitride (SiN) waveguide technology developed by Ultra-low Loss Technologies (ULL).

Project Summary/AbstractProject Title: The purchase of an alternate feed in support of land-based oyster farming.PD/PI Name:Tap PryorInstitution: Maine Shellfish Developers LLCProblem/Opportunity: Closed containment farming of large numbers of certain intertidalshellfish at non-coastal sites appears to be economically feasible given suitable tankage flawlesswater quality a high level of automation and - crucially - an inexpensive bulk source ofmicroalgae as a key feed component. It is noteworthy that the biofuel and omega-3 foodindustries culture microalgae in bulk both in ponds and with fermenter-bioreactors - commonindustrial methods not yet co-opted by aquaculturists. It is serendipitous that this should be thecase at a time when near-shore oyster farming is struggling to survive let alone expand burdenedby regulatory and environmental constraints. It presents an opportunity for a breakaway to land-
based farming of oysters although not without fresh technical challenges. The newcomer willrequire a complex supply chain demanding attention to transport storage and delivery todensely loaded stock on a reliable schedule.Project Objectives: We call it a ""farm"" although really it is a ""feedlot"" a type of animal feedingoperation used for intensive animal grow-out. Feedlots are faulted for behavioral reasons butoysters are literally brainless in effect compact eating machines. Accepting the feedlot analogychallenges the land-based shellfish industry to reach its full potential eventually harvesting in thebillions like greenhouse tomatoes. The overarching objective is to determine if it's possible totransport and store industrial-cultured algae without significant degradation of nutritional valuesdevelop feeding protocols to optimize nutritional uptake and confirm the cost effectiveness ofusing an outside source of feed production vs. growing on site.Description of the Effort:Maine Shellfish Developers (MSD) will be transporting algae from asingle supplier long enough to identify types of equipment needed and any biological constrains.Not all modes of algae that are offered can be trialed but even one - pressed algal residuals -will allow ample data collection from two-tank experimental comparisons of growth and survivalof different densities. Intermediate to these investigations will be obtaining nutritional profilesenergy demands and the manpower versus automation cost factors. Conclusions from these datawill inform the Phase II objectives as well as MSD's overall business plan.Anticipated Results: By the end of Phase I we will have demonstrated feasible sourcing anddelivering of a low cost and effective feed for land-based shellfish culture. We proposeemulating the cattle feedlot model i.e. purchasing not developing our own feed. By doing so wewill expand faster sooner and with lower costs per unit thanks to economies of scale and moreto the point focusing on that which we know best - growing shellfish.Potential Commercial Applications: MSD has identified several potential bulk algae sourcesconfirmed that at least pressed algal residual is inexpensively available and needs now to testseveral for cost effectiveness.It seems therefore that intertidal shellfish are on the path togenuine domestication. Capable of remaining out of water in good health at room temperaturethey are already semi-terrestrial and can be routinely washed sorted weighed counted and evenlaser branded. This is more agribusiness than aquaculture. It portends a mini revolution inseafood security. Some of our favorite and most health-giving foodstuff becomes available to allin effect everyman's cheap luxury. The land-based concept portends offering excellent oysters athalf the cost. Moreover they will be sustainable traceable and harvested weekly year around.",  ,,,,Taylor  Pryor,,(207) 406-2669,pryor.tap@gmail.com,,  ,

These structures have highly complex three-dimensional surface geometry, which can result in misalignment of the nut plate and the bolts that are used to fasten the panels. These structures may be exposed to high vibration and extreme thermal changes resulting in loss of bolt preload and eventual failure of the assembled structure. Current nut plates rely only on friction for the bolted joint. To overcome the above stated constraints, Enduralock proposes a project to develop a self-aligning nut plate technology with a mechanical locking mechanism that is magnetically actuated. The technology provides for a positively locking solution that is highly vibration resistant with easy reversibility and reusability. The axially spring-loaded nut element design allows for engagement of an off-axis bolt, and it then self-aligns during tightening. It also provides for a fixed position panel bolt retaining ring, which reduces the chance of breakage and foreign object debris (FOD). The nut plate is ideal for in-space robotic assembly and for reducing maintenance time with access panels on aircraft and spacecraft. ",AFWERX  AFWERX,,() -,AFWERX@US.AF.MIL,Igor  Komsitsky,,(310) 299-6431,ikomsitsky@enduralock.com,,  ,

In support of critical operational mission infrastructures, there exists a need for Army warfighters to be able to share mission critical information from the battlefield to operational units and base stations. These systems also typically operate in spectrum-limited environments overseas, requiring new uses of spectrum efficient designs to support mass data transfer. The next generation of Army and Joint Service tactical communication systems will be required to operate under more restricted, congested, contested, and denied environments in full duplex operations to support “data at speed” to the warfighter in the field.

The SF-STAR approach allows for extremely efficient use of spectrum resources and allows for full duplex operation of communications systems, where radios are exposed to both untethered intended and unintended interferences. The key operating challenge for such a system is to minimize the amount of cross-channel interference between the high-powered transmitter and the highly sensitive receiver. Performance advancements in mixer, analog filter, and channel isolator (e.g., circulators) components have been a major enabler in the development and implementation of SF-STAR systems.

To increase spectral efficiency further, the Army needs new ways to both increase the spectrum efficiency and reduce the degrading effects of interference. The objective of the proposed program is to develop tactical radios with same-frequency simultaneous transmit and receive (SF-STAR) capability. In Year 1 of the program, Photonic Systems, Inc. (PSI) and subcontractor General Dynamics - Applied Physical Sciences (GD-APS) will design and assemble tactical radios based on software-defined radios (SDRs) that simultaneously transmit at the same frequency as they receive, and that suppress the transmit signal at the receiver while also suppressing interference signals. A portion of the required suppression will be performed in the analog domain prior to digitization, and the remainder will occur in the digital domain, with the most advantageous apportionment between these domains to be determined via modeling. Year 1 will end in a demo at an Army site of two such radios communicating in the presence of Electronic Attack (EA) signals. At each receiver this will require suppression of both the “self” interference (that radio’s own transmit signal) and “untethered” interference (the EA signals). In the portion of suppression to be performed in the digital domain, suppression of the self-interference will involve an algorithm that subtracts from the input signal a weighted portion of a reference copy of the known transmit signal so as to maximally suppress the residual transmit signal – i.e., the portion remaining after the suppression that was performed in the analog domain. Suppression of EA signals, however, will require the use of PSI's “self-isolating reference (SIR)” algorithm that suppresses signals without the need for a reference copy of the interferers. In Year 2, the team will adjust the design of the Year 1 tactical radios so that, in addition to its previously demonstrated capabilities, one radio can receive the signal transmitted by a second radio while in the proximity of third and fourth transmitting radios. The team will assemble these 4 radios and demonstrate them at an Army site. At each radio’s receiver the suppression of “untethered” interference will now involve suppressing both the EA signals and the signals transmitted by two other radios. Whereas the SIR algorithm that was used in Year 1 to isolate the EA signals for suppression was what PSI calls the “Y/X” version of the SIR, the Year 2 demonstration will also require the use of what PSI calls the “X/X” version of the SIR to isolate and suppress the third and fourth radios’ transmit signals, which have the same frequency and format as the desired signal.",German  Cortes,Team Lead,(443) 395-7468,german.cortes5.civ@mail.mil,Charles  Cox,,(978) 670-4990,ccox@photonicsinc.com,,  ,

This allows carbon capture from streams of any concentration (including air at ~ 400 ppm), and its release into any carrier stream, including pure CO2, with a low balance of plant. The electro-swing basis of our process allows its linear scaling with desired capacity and lends it geometric flexibility. Also, the electrical nature of the process allow its seamless integration into the renewable energy grid, where energy can be stored as captured CO2, mitigating the effect of renewable energy intermittency.

Influenza virus (INFV) results in global seasonal and pandemic outbreaks estimated to cause
severe illness in 3 to 5 million people annually resulting in significant morbidity and up to 650,000
deaths. The influenza burden also results in substantial economic loss. The goal of this program
is to develop a therapeutic antibody offering effective treatment with broad heterosubtypic
specificity for influenza viruses without inducing resistance. Our therapeutic antibody (3I14) has
shown broad neutralizing activity against 14 strains of INFV A Groups 1 and 2 and both
prophylactic and therapeutic protection in BALB/c mouse models of H1, H3, H5 and H7 serotypes.
This Fast-track proposal is intended to establish a stable expressing cell line for manufacturing,
identify an optimal product formulation, characterize the dose response and tolerability of the
product in nonclinical studies, and complete the mouse efficacy data package. Completion of
these milestones are critical for advancement to IND-enabling studies and clinical development.
3I14 binds the stem of both the uncleaved HA precursor and two mature forms of HA, either after
trypsin activation alone or when followed by low-pH trigger. 3I14 prevents both the dissociation of
HA1-HA2 and the pH-dependent HA rearrangement necessary for membrane fusion. Targeting
the highly conserved HA stem epitope is also expected to drastically reduce the likelihood of viral
resistance, a significant barrier to developing effective therapeutics for influenza.
Integrated Biotherapeutics (IBT) has extensive experience in preclinical model and antibody
product development for infectious diseases. Dr. Holtsberg and his team have extensive
experience in providing services to pharma companies over the past 8 years in the development
and use of in vitro assays and animal models for testing influenza therapies. This expertise is
complimented by a strong strategic partnership with AbViro LLC with subject matter expertise
specific to influenza and focus on integrated program management skillsets, extensive knowledge
of preclinical product development and clinical science, regulatory expertise, and business and
commercialization strategy for broad-spectrum antibodies capable of advancing 3I14 into clinical
studies. IBT will also collaborate with MassBiologics, IIT Research Institute (IITRI) and La Jolla
Institute for Allergy and Immunology (LJI). MassBiologics offers strong competency in stable cell
line and manufacturing process development. IIT Research Institute (IITRI) provides relevant
highly pathogenic influenza strains and animal models essential for rigorous evaluation of product
efficacy. LJI provides core research functionality with next-generation sequencing capabilities.
This development team has successfully advanced another broad-spectrum human monoclonal
antibody targeting dengue virus to IND-enabling studies.",  ,,,,FREDERICK W HOLTSBERG,,(240) 778-6523,rick@integratedbiotherapeutics.com,,  ,

Using a combination of both teams’ techniques, we expect to meet and/or exceed the key goals of this BAA.

Kumu Full-Duplex LTE Relays have at their core Analog + Digital Self Interference Cancellation modules that are already commercially deployed in US mobile operator LTE networks serving live network traffic and meet commercial performance KPI’s. Separately, MITLL has demonstrated the use of Antenna Cancellation and Adaptive Digital Receive Beamforming techniques to enhance cancellation performance and dynamically create beamforming null patterns that can be used to enhance co-located and non-co-located interference cancellation. Our technical solution offers superior cancellation performance of >100dB self-interference cancellation (excluding antenna isolation) as well as the ability to mitigate interference from friendly co-located in-channel interferers and not friendly, non-co-located interferers (e.g. electronic attack). The first component of our solution is Antenna Cancellation that has been proven to achieve >25dB cancellation. Second, for Analog Cancellation we have field proven, chip-scale solution that achieves >40-45dB self-interference cancellation and can already support a wide range of bands using appropriate external mixers. Third, our Digital Canceller has demonstrated >40dB of isolation enhancement including across 400MHz bandwidth in 28GHz mmWave band.

This phenomenon is affecting food distribution system across the country. Due to theurban space constraints food needs to be grown in less populated rural areas and transportedoften over long distances to reach consumers. The transport negatively affects the quality andfreshness of the food and contributes to the high food waste levels across the country. Currentlyin the United States between 30-40% of the food supply is wasted.Vertical farming has a high potential for tackling the above problems as it significantlyshortens the distance between farm and consumer reduces the travel distance improves thefood's quality and freshness and decreases the food waste levels. However all currently-
available vertical farming solutions rely on artificial lighting to drive the process ofphotosynthesis. This results in approximately 30%-higher energy usage up to 20%-higher priceof the grown food products and significant CO emissions compared to the traditional field2farming. Consequently unit economics are not favorable for this type of technology.In response to these problems FEN Technology is developing a vertical farmingcontainer with an innovative daylighting system.The daylighting system collects the sunlightand transports it through a low-attenuation optic fiber illuminating plants inside the container.FEN Technology will use the Phase I funding for creating a proof-of-concept for the daylightingsystem based on an optic fiber. This solution will allow stackable vertical farming containers tooperate without a significant reliance on artificial lighting therefore significantly reducingoperating costs thus eliminating a considerable hurdle preventing the vertical farmingtechnology from reaching a full commercial success.The research will focus on designing and testing an optimum daylighting system basedon Fresnel lens and optic fibers that allows to transport natural light with 6 times lower lossescompared to the existing daylighting systems used for illuminating offices that are based onplastic fibers.The system will be able to illuminate the plants inside the vertical farm containerwith an intensity of 1500 lux allowing them to grow efficiently.This would drastically improvethe unit economics of the indoor vertical farms so that the produced food can compete with thetraditionally soil-grown products in terms of price and quality. We believe that this daylightingsystem is well-suited for vertical farming due to the high economic returns of efficient lighting inthis application and the reduced environmental impact.",  ,,,,Stephen  Horowitz,,(786) 449-0590,fentechnologyusa_grants@outlook.com,,  ,

In MD a hydrophobic porousmembrane separates a warm fermentation product feed and a permeate stream.As thefermentation products pass on the membrane the ethanol is partially transformed to its vapor.The hydrophobicity of the membrane prevents the aqueous solution from entering the membrane.However freed from hydrogen bonding the ethanol passes through and is collected as aconcentrate. The novel membrane referred to as carbon nanotube immobilized membrane(CNIM) will be developed by immobilizing functionalized CNTs into membrane pores toselectively transport ethanol vapor. The CNIM along with a modified MD process thatincorporates air sparging (or CNIM-MD) will be used for the economic recovery of biofuels. Ourpreliminary data shows that the CNIM-MD can be carried out at relatively low temperatureso o
between 40 to 70 C as compared to 80 to 90 C for thermal distillation. CNIM-MD will lead tothe lowering of capital expenditure operating cost and it will facilitate the recovery of ethanolfrom low concertation waste streams.

AbstractWhile vaccines and antivirals may be long term solutions to the current coronavirus pandemic, it is now
widely appreciated that the pandemic can be managed before these emerge by rapid, point-of-sampling andquot;public
space entry testsandquot; (PSETs), given appropriate FDA regulatory relief. PSETs will be even more important if a
good vaccine never emerges, a possibility given experience with other coronaviruses.In the 2003 SARS crisis, we delivered a andquot;best in classandquot; PCR kit for SARS that targeted coronaviral RNA. This
was possible due to our first generation nucleic acid innovations, which were also used in respiratory pathogen
panels and cystic fibrosis tests, inter alia. Luminex acquired EraGen in 2011 for $34 million. Since then, the PI
generated 2nd and 3rd generation innovations that supported tests for MERS, arboviruses, norovirus and, this
year, CoV-19 itself. These include a PSET that gives 10 minute results using proprietary displaceable probe loop
amplification. Intrinsic chemistry suggests, however, this is the fastest any RNA-targeted test can be.Here, we will use our 3rd-generation DNA innovations not to target coronaviral RNA, but the coronavirus
itself. Firebird will create reagents (AEGISZymes) from an artificially expanded genetic information system
(AEGIS) that catalyze covalent acylation of lysines on the surface of ~300 spike proteins per virus. Each
acylation will generate ~300 redox active moieties on an electrode surface per virion. The test is conceptually
advanced over antibody tests, as it uses stable covalent bond formation, rather than non-covalent antibody:
antigen interactions, and exploits electrochemical detection rather than a lateral flow. Our Phase 2 partner,
MightyGate, has shown with standard aptamers detection in less than a minute with such architectures.
With andgt;100x sensitivity over Abbott BinaxNOWTM, the assay should detect virus in any contagious individual at
entrances to arenas, schools, and other spaces as fast has handbags and are checked. Specifically, we will:
Aim 1. Under IRB 2020001, we will use AEGIS-LIVE to evolve AEGISZymes in saliva that acylate lysines inspike proteins and peptide loops of CoV-19, SARS, and MERS.
Aim 2. Metric the AEGISZymes that emerge, measuring their binding affinities, acylation rates, and specificityamong the 3 homologous surface loops. The metrics are:M1. Acylation with kcat ≈ 1 sec-1. This should be readily achieved based on pmolar affinities that are nowroutine with AEGIS-LIVE; similar rate constants are now routine in analogous catalysts.M2. Specificity with kcat/Kdiss ratios andgt;103, to ensure that CoV-19 is distinguished from other coronaviruses.If the metrics are met, MightyGate has committed itself to participate in Phase 2 work that will incorporate
AEGISZymes onto its kiosk-style instrument. The kiosk has been proven with standard aptamers to give
electrochemical readouts in less than 1 minute. Firebirdandapos;s AEGISZymes will immediately improve the sensitivity
of that kiosk, and immediate commercial value. However, our approach is general to any virus target.Reagents to Chemically Tag Specific Coronavirus Spike Proteins

tag covalently coronaviral proteins for use in a kiosk-style PSET instrument that our partner, MightyGate, has
shown to be able to generate true/false readouts in less than a minute, the time it takes to check a backpack

Augmenting the Power of Physical Models with Interactive Digital Media
Science and STEM education requires more effective tools that will engage student attention, challenge them to think
critically, and help them learn critical science literacy concepts to create a stronger workforce and citizenry. The primary
objective of the project Augmenting the Power of Physical Models with Interactive Digital Media, is to transport
students further into the molecular world by developing augmented reality (AR) modules that seamlessly extend the
value of 3D Molecular Designs’ (3DMD) models. With 3DMD AR, students will engage with 3DMD’s models in a new
way, intuitively navigating at their own pace and constructing their own knowledge while being guided by seamlessly
integrated interactive digital media. Immersed in the intrinsic dynamics of molecular structures, they will manipulate the
physical model – moving, rotating, adjusting – while digital features move in concert revealing new layers of complexity.
3DMD AR will allow educators to engage more students at middle school, high school, and undergraduate levels by
piquing their interest with cutting edge technology and game-based learning applications. The addition of AR features
to these instructional materials will not only expand the range of molecular concepts that can be taught with each
modeling kit, but will also engage a broader range of today’s students from both economically disadvantaged schools
and remote learning environments. 3DMD AR has broad STEM commercial and educational potential. The augmented
reality modules described in this proposal can be deployed with any smart mobile device (phone or tablet), making
3DMD AR accessible to a wide range of schools and budgets.
Phase I of the project will focus on the feasibility of using augmented reality with our current physical models. The
Specific Aims of the project are:1. Test the feasibility of augmented reality software to identify and track the movement with 3DMD’s five types ofphysical models: 2D-printed graphics, die-stamped foam, plastic injection-molded molecules, 3D-printed proteins,and a flexible foam-covered modeling wire (mini toober).2. Focusing one type of physical model – injection-molded water molecules – 3DMD will test the feasibility ofaugmented reality software to: overlay a variety of types of digital media, allow user actions to trigger responsesfrom the AR software, and determine optimal techniques to interact with physical models and digital devices.
By following an internal process of iterative design, the research team will test augmented reality targeting techniques
to identify and track physical models. After targeting is achieved, the team will continue this process to develop digital
overlays, trigger responses, and ergonomics. The Education Advisory Group will inform the research team of the most
useful content to augment the physical models and critique the initial usability of the applications.Project Narrative
Augmenting the Power of Physical Models with Interactive Digital Media
The research described in this Phase I proposal will explore the use of augmented reality (AR) media to enhance the

These hardware attacks allow key extraction from cryptographic implementations, and fault injection specifically allows complete takeover of devices. Current commercial chip design tools do not offer integrated analysis to verify resistance against these attacks at design time. The effect is that countermeasure design is a manual and error-prone process: multiple tape outs may be required, and even for experts it is nontrivial to pinpoint and mitigate sources of vulnerability. The tools we are creating allow an EDA designer without specific side channel and fault injection knowledge to create a design with countermeasures and validate them pre-tapeout. We enable secure design space exploration by allowing the designer to analyze the security and PPA impact of various countermeasures. This Phase 2 effort extends the results from the Phase 1 data that indicates the feasibility of this approach, with several challenges to still overcome. By bringing this type of analysis and countermeasure insertion into the design flow, security joins power, performance, and area in the ASIC design flow. The goal is to significantly bring down the cost of creating chips with side channel and fault attack resistance, by enabling non-expert designers to create a resistant chip without having to perform multiple tape-outs. At the maximum security setting, the chip will have 10x less leakage and 10x smaller fault probability than without this technology, and we target an iteration time of 24 hours. The result is a design process and commercializable tooling to enable a non-security-expert designer in creating a side channel and fault resistant design. The effect of this tooling is massive cost savings through reduced tape-outs, and significant increase in security.",Serge N Leef,program manager,(703) 526-2823,serge.leef@darpa.mil,Mark  Beal,,(508) 735-1500,mbeal@intrinsix.com,,  ,

This actuator can be scaled from millimeter level to 10s of centimeters; is composed  of a bundle of microfibers that produce tension like natural muscles, with clear superior properties versus hydraulic and electrical actuators used today. This project will miniaturize fiber dimension, dramatically reducing the operating voltage and allowing  the control electronics to be  easily miniaturized as well. Through this SBIR Elysium will deliver to DARPA > 10 sample actuators composed of 100 bundled fiber, where each fiber will have an OD  1% at less than 300V.   Conventional actuators for robotics are electric motors and hydraulic drives. Both are complex, heavy, inefficient, unsafe, and expensive. Motors are terribly inefficient when operating at low speeds—which are needed to actuate robots—a problem that worsens with smaller size. Hydraulic actuators have higher torque density, but the mass of the valves, pumps, and accessories limit system-wide torque density. Hydraulic pistons and electric motors date back two centuries and are technological dead-ends.   Dielectric Elastomers (DE) were identified in the early 2000s as the most promising materials to make artificial muscles capable of solving the robotics actuation problem due to their fast response time, high energy density, large strains, low-cost, noiseless operation, and long lifetimes. Research has mostly focused on DE actuators that consist of an elastomer film–which acts as an insulator–sandwiched between two compliant electrodes forming a parallel plate capacitor. Actuators based on DE films have been difficult to integrate into robotic systems. Elysium Robotics’ core innovation is a DE microfiber actuator that implements a coaxial capacitor and can overcome the limitations of film-based DE actuators. DE microfibers can easily be integrated into robotic applications because they produce tension just like muscles. By leveraging  textile and cable coating manufacturing technologies, these fibers can be scaled down to a few micrometers and produced at low cost.   For this SBIR project, Elysium intends to continue refining hollow silicone dielectric elastomers microfibers via a proprietary process, to further miniaturize, integrate and demonstrate fiber bundles to meet the Phase II objectives.   Similar to the basic architecture of muscle,  DE fibers can scale from the micro to the macro scale.

accessible single cell (SC) mapping technology for histone post-translational modifications (PTMs). SC analyses
enable the study of rare cell types that are masked when analyzing heterogeneous tissues. Further, SC analysis
allows investigators to reliably cluster and analyze specific cellular subpopulations in situ (i.e. without cell
sorting), which will be key for (pre)clinical applications. Histone PTMs are the focus of many drug development
programs and correlate with unique chromatin features (e.g. promoters, enhancers). Thus, SC analysis of
histone PTMs will provide a powerful new tool to study chromatin structure and gene regulation,
delivering novel insights that are not possible to discern with current SC approaches (e.g. scATAC-seq or scRNA-
seq). Existing mapping assays for histone PTMs, specifically Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-
seq), require thousands of cells to achieve adequate signal over noise (S/N), and thus have poor resolution for
SC analysis. In contrast, our scCUTANA assay platform leverages EpiCypher’s ultra-sensitive Cleavage Under
Targets and Tagmentation (CUTandTag) technology, which uses antibodies to bind PTMs in situ, and then applies a
protein A-protein G fusion protein to tether hyperactive Tn5 transposase (pAG-Tn5) to these sites. Controlled
activation of Tn5 results in fragmentation and ligation of sequencing adapters for paired-end sequencing. This
ultra-sensitive method can generate high S/N mapping data using as few 1-3 million reads. Dr. Ahmad (with Dr.
Steven Henikoff) has recently developed CUTandTag-based methods for SC chromatin mapping using nanowell
array- and droplet-based systems. However, these nascent approaches require significant instrument
investments, large sample inputs (rt100K cells), and/or are not readily amenable to workflow automation, limiting
their widespread commercial utility and potential clinical application. The innovation of scCUTANA lies within
1) the development of a combinatorial cellular indexing approach that mitigates the need for expensive
instruments / reagents and streamlines sample processing, 2) the ability to scale while requiring minimal cellular
inputs, and 3) the use of DNA-barcoded recombinant nucleosomes to identify specific and ultra-efficient “SC-
grade” antibodies that dramatically increase assay sensitivity and reliability. In Phase II, we will continue
development of this “benchtop” SC genomic mapping technology, by scaling manufacturing of our pAG-Tn5
library (Aim 1), optimizing robust protocols using a range of cells and tissues (Aim 2), and developing automated
workflows and scCUTANA beta kits for internal / external validation (Aim 3). The commercial scCUTANA product
will comprise two 96-well plates, containing 96 uniquely barcoded pAG-Tn5 complexes (Plate 1), barcoded PCR
oligos for library enrichment (Plate 2), and other reagents for sample processing. This disruptive assay platform
will be economical for laboratories of all resources, providing immediate, wide access to SC genomic mapping

and firefighting applications as a component of aqueous film forming foams (AFFFs). Because members
of this class of chemicals are persistent, they are prevalent in nature and are detected across the globe in
water, air, soil, plants, animals, and even in human milk and blood. They are toxic to human health, and
even at lower levels are linked to developmental effects in infants, liver toxicity, increased risk of certain
types of cancer, immune system impacts, thyroid disease, and many other health issues.
Therefore the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has recently set health advisories level for two PFAS,
perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) at 70 ng/L individually or combined.
In response to the need for remediation of PFAS contaminated water many technologies have been
scrutinized, including adsorption-based remediation technology. Most notably, the use of granular activated
carbon (GAC) and ion exchange resins sorbents. Among these, GAC is the most widely accepted and
commonly used treatment technology for PFAS contaminated groundwater and drinking water. However,
GAC has many drawbacks for example its susceptibility to fouling by natural organic matter, expensive
intensive high energy regeneration process, and inferior in removal of short chain PFAS. Additionally, since
GAC is not designed for PFAS adsorption it displays only low affinity towards PFAS, thus, it requires
significantly large amounts of GAC to achieve the desired PFAS levels. Therefore, there is a need for
adsorbents that are specifically designed for the PFOA/PFOS removal in efficient, cost-effective, and
recyclable manner.
In ongoing research, Weaver Labs has designed novel PFOA/PFOS specific adsorbents that leverage an
advanced solid support platform. In the preliminary adsorption studies, the adsorbent demonstrated superior
PFOA/PFOS affinity compared to GAC technology using PFOA/PFOS contaminated real world
groundwater. Weaver labs’ long-term goal for this project is to develop commercial PFAS specific
adsorbent filter that is highly efficient, effective, recyclable and economical which can be utilized to purify
PFAS contaminated water. Ultimately, it would allow pure water to be delivered to the public, thus
decreasing the health risk associated with these chemicals. To meet the long-term goal this proposal’s
objective is to develop and screen novel adsorbents, carry out the required kinetic adsorption study
experiments, and optimize its regeneration and reuse. The completion of proposed study will position us
for phase II studies, including a rapid small-scale column study, and eventual pilot study.Project Narrative
Perfluorinated chemicals (PFAS) are ubiquitous in the environment and many municipal
public drinking water systems across the US are contaminated. As several studies have
associated PFAS to a number serious diseases such as cancer, thyroid disease, changes
in liver enzymes, increases in cholesterol levels, and many other diseases, there are clear
public health concerns. Current technology was not designed for use with PFAS. In
response to PFAS contamination, this project will design a PFAS specific novel adsorbent
filter based on fundamental principles that can efficiently remove these toxic chemicals
from the contaminated water, thus, providing safer public drinking water, improving the
quality of the environment, and ultimately enhancing public health.",  ,,,,ANURADHA  SINGH,,(405) 740-3165,anuradha.singh@weaver-labs.com,,  ,

Arima Genomics
Project Summary/Abstract
Precise regulation of gene expression is paramount to establishing cellular identities, and mis-regulation of genes
causes human disease. Cells regulate gene expression using regulatory elements (REs), short DNA sequences
embedded throughout the genome, who are bound by transcriptional proteins to facilitate their regulatory
function. Molecular mapping tools, such as Chromatin immunoprecipitation and next gen sequencing (ChIP-
seq), produce “maps” of REs along the genome and have been a ubiquitous approach towards understand gene
regulation and define cell types and states based on unique RE signatures. However, these locations of REs are
only understood in context of a linear genome. In reality, REs execute their gene control within a three
dimensional (3D) genome. Therefore to truly understand gene regulation – gene regulation must be mapped in
3D. Indeed, high throughput chromatin interaction capture (HiC) was developed to produce 3D interaction maps
of all 3 billion bases in the human genome. HiC has facilitated discovery of several fundamental principles DNA
folding in 3D, including cases where DNA mis-folding contributes to disease. However, HiC does measure
transcriptional protein binding, nor whether a chromatin interaction is regulatory, thus having limited utility in
advancing our understanding 3D gene regulation. Recently, novel approaches attempt to combine the molecular
steps of ChIP-seq and chromatin interaction capture to measure transcriptional protein binding and mediated
chromatin interactions in a single assay. However these approaches, termed ChIA-PET and HiChIP, do not
efficiently capture chromatin interactions or transcriptional protein binding, respectively. Therefore, there is dire
need for improve methods that truly facilitate mapping of gene regulation in 3D.
We satisfy this unmet need via our highly optimized, first generation HiChIP solution, Arima-HiChIP (A-HiChIP),
that demonstrates efficient and reproducible mapping of transcriptional protein binding and chromatin
interactions in cell lines, with higher cellular inputs and a limited set of transcriptional proteins. Our team has
unmatchable expertise in the science of chromatin interaction capture and its commercialization. First, we
commercialized Arima-HiC kits in 2018 for studying general principles of chromatin interactions and generated
$1.2M in revenue in the 1st year of commercialization and $2M in revenue in the 2nd year, with 500+ customers,
and 100% growth from 2018 to 2019. Based on VOC analytics, we shifted our focus to develop a more relatable
product to the gene regulation market – A-HiChIP - that customers wanted and that represented a larger market
opportunity. Indeed, after our self-funded phase-1 RandD and commercial developments, we launched our first
generation HiChIP solution into the market and have seen remarkable success – measured by HiChIP growing
from 19% to 40% of our revenue contributions, increased quality of revenue, and traction with KOLs, large
consortia, and COVID research. However, these kits are limited in terms of the capabilities – they are not robust
to a range of transcriptional proteins, they are not optimized towards tissue samples, and they are not optimized
towards lower sample input quantities. To enable broader adoption and discovery, we have shown the
development towards our second-generation A-HiChIP solution, with advancement towards low sample inputs,
tissues, and a broader range of transcriptional proteins. We validate the technology on internal samples provided
by academic collaborators and externally in customer hands via prototype beta kits.
As part of this direct-2-phase II program, we propose to further develop our technology into truly robust, low input
compatible, end-to-end kitted HiChIP solution for concurrent analysis of transcriptional protein binding and
chromatin interactions in tissue samples and across a host of important transcriptional proteins. We also propose
rigorous and essential product development experiments, to ensure commercialization of a robust, premium-
performance kit-based product that is optimally integrated into the ecosystem. Upon successful completion of
the technical and commercial developments in Aims 1 and 2, we propose to benchmark and validate the our next-
generation HiChIP solution through collaboration and prototype (beta) kit and bioinformatics evaluations with key
opinion leaders (KOLs) across customer segments.",  ,,,,ANTHONY  SCHMITT,,(617) 842-9022,anthony@arimagenomics.com,,  ,

The technical objectives of this Phase II effort focus on the development of a flexible, wearable fabric interface for tactile arrays that are scalable in size and complexity, and suitable for the TSAS application. We leverage advancements in printed conductive inks that are laminated onto flexible garments. Our Phase I effort demonstrated the potential our Flex-Fabric Tactile interface (F2Ti) to provide a scalable, low weight and reliable garment that can comfortably and correctly situate multiple tactors (tactile array) against the body of a user. The F2Ti technology offers the potential of lower cost, allowing a pathway to production, maintenance, and meet washability and military use requirements, thereby enabling the deployment of EAI’s enhanced Tactile Situational Awareness System (eTSAS) and many related wearable tactile applications. During Phase II, the F2Ti approach will be integrated into user identified specific clothing designs such as a belt, compression undershirt and body garment. We will test the usability, environmental specifications, EMI, and washability, and will refine and prototype working eTSAS systems based on our Phase I technology demonstration concepts. We will explore and implement options for battery-powered, umbilical-free wireless integration and transition the wearable electronic garment to the flight environment. We will also incorporate feedback from users and stakeholders in our design phase and conduct usability and subject matter expert evaluations of our completed products, and will demonstrate product durability to include at least 100 wash cycles. EAI proposes a multitask effort, together with a team of industrial designers, flex printed ink fabricators, pattern designers and specialist garment fabricators, and plan to have working prototypes at the conclusion of the effort.",Will  Bell,,,william.bell.30@us.af.mil,Bruce  Mortimer,,(407) 645-5444,bmort@eaiinfo.com,,  ,

enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) sandwich assays that simultaneously measure 6 or moredisease-defining biomarkers and provide an automated result to the practitioner within 10 minutesof receiving a biofluid from the patient.The practitioner will only need to add sample to theinstrument snap the SERS applicator into place press start and receive test results.The Phase Iobjective will be to demonstrate the ability of a SERS sandwich assay to simultaneously detecttwo prostate cancer biomarkers in urine at medically relevant concentrations. Signal linearitylimits of detection reproducibility and false positive/negative rates will be quantified.The PhaseII program will extend the original SERS sandwich assay to simultaneously monitor six prostatecancer biomarkers and to create a pancreatic cancer biomarker assay.Program results will create cost effective disease diagnostic tests that can be performed quickly bythe practitioner.Based on patient information the practitioner can choose the appropriate SERSprobe and rapidly verify disease presence/absence.Not only will these tests close the urban/ruralhealth care gap they can be an efficient prescreening tool in any environment lowering overallhealth care costs.EIC will commercialize the instrument software and SERS sandwich diseasedetection assays.This program can be extended to a wide variety of diseases and infectionsunlocking a significant commercial market.1",  ,,,,Kevin  Spencer,,(781) 769-9450,spencer@eiclabs.com,,  ,

These estimates are based on the 21,000 health care organizations accredited by the Joint Commission but ignore errors in combat casualty where these numbers are likely to be higher due to the harsh nature of combat environments. Why do patient handoffs matter? Patient handoffs are critical for facilitating and informing decisions about the next level of care and can impact treatment throughout the continuum of care. A standardized approach can help mitigate known risks related to information loss. In addition, the written information transferred during a handoff serves as a patient record. This record informs the patient’s long-term care and determines disability benefits for life. Handoffs are conducted by teams of at least two; and in combat casualty care, there are many known challenges. First, these teams could have little or no previous interactions and may even involve transport teams with no medical background, further complicating communication and coordination of care. Operational experience suggests that context/environment, experience, expertise, and state of the individuals involved in the care of the wounded are among the many factors that could affect successful handoff. These factors impact the way in which information is captured and communicated, which drive the success of the handoff. Imagine a common scenario in recent engagements involving a Marine unit on a foot patrol in Afghanistan—one explosion, then another. This routine procedure of transferring care from one provider to another is fraught with challenges. On the bird, the medic gives the patient more morphine because he appears to be in extreme pain. Unfortunately, the patient immediately deteriorates as his heart slows and blood pressure drops. The patient dies due to a combination of morphine overdose and blood loss. The ultimate goal of this proposed work is to improve combat survivability and reduce preventable deaths by focusing on the challenges that revolve around communication during patient handoffs in combat situations. Products of this work will be a patient handoff protocol based on science and operational requirements and associated training linked to existing Tactical Combat Casualty (TCCC) training. The Effective Combat Casualty Care Handoff Operations (ECCCHO) protocol incorporates the science of effective team communications as well as current best practices in the field.

Tilapia are the second most important farmed finfish worldwideand the emergence of this pathogen already in 16 countries is an indication that efforts should beintensified to provide an effective biocontrol methodology. There have already been three outbreaks ofTiLVD in the US.During the Phase I research we will perform a bioinformatics study of all availablegenomes of this negative sense RNA virus in order to determine the most conserved regions of criticalproteins. Since this is an RNA virus and known to mutate the bioinformatics study will be critical inselection of regions for production of a subunit vaccine based on recombinant peptides. We will use theprotein from segment 8 as our first potential vaccine target. We will also clone three of the mostconserved peptide regions identified in the bioinformatics study into yeast (single peptide containingyeast) to be used as an oral vaccine in rapid testng. The transgenic yeast containing the segment 8protein will be induced to produce the recombinant protein harvested and lysed by cavitation andfreeze dried. The freeze dried yeast will be encapsulated in the proprietary MSPâ„¢ system(Matrix/Scaffold/Payload) with an oral immunostimulator derived from Lactobacillus for a formulationsuitable to oral delivery to tilapia. During Phase I we will deliver the vaccine both orally and by injectioninto tilapia (versus control) and look for stimulation of specific antibodies against TiLV upregulation ofimmune related genes and determine by histology if any unexpected damage is induced by thisapproach. A successful Phase I will demonstrate a robust oral stimulation of an immune response intilapia and set the stage for an expanded study in Phase II.,  ,,,,F C Thomas  Allnutt,,(443) 878-4957,tom@nulode.com,,  ,

First, the throughput
capacity of in vitro genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs, especially for early, high volume
screening environments that need to prioritize chemicals for further testing and/or development. Second,
conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or
no information provided about genotoxic mode of action. This is severely limiting, as it does not generate key
information necessary for prioritizing chemicals for further testing, guiding subsequent assays’
endpoints/experimental designs, or conducting risk assessments. Finally, most current assays do not place
requisite emphasis on dose response relationships, and therefore do not contextualize the results in terms of
potency. These deficiencies prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments,
where all of these capabilities and high information content are essential. We will solve these issues by
developing, optimizing, and validating a two-tiered testing strategy based on multiplexed DNA damage
responsive biomarkers and high-speed flow cytometric analysis. The first-tier focuses on throughput and is
used to prioritize likely genotoxicants for more comprehensive analysis in second tier testing. Specifically, it
involves a collection of several multiplexed biomarkers that will be used to identify likely genotoxic agents and
provide a preliminary assessment of genotoxic mode of action. The gH2AX biomarker detects DNA double
strand breaks, phospho-histone H3 identifies mitotic cells, nuclear p53 content reports on p53 activation in
response to DNA damage, the frequency of 8n+ cells measure polyploidization, and the ratio of nuclei to
microsphere counts provides information about treatment-related cytotoxicity. The second tier focuses on
information content and considers many more concentrations as well as additional biomarkers, including
micronucleus formation. Collectively, the tier two results provide definitive predictions about test chemicals’
genotoxic potential, mode of action, and potency. Over the course of this project we will study more than 3,000
diverse chemicals in order to understand the performance characteristics and generalizability of the two-tiered
testing strategy. An interlaboratory trial will be conducted with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability
of the methods, with the ultimate goal of providing the Nation with commercially available kits and testing
services.Project Narrative
Some chemicals in commercial use and in the environment can cause DNA damage and this damage can
contribute to the development of cancer and other severe diseases. We will develop, optimize, and validate an
improved testing strategy based on highly automated processes tracking several DNA damage biomarkers that
can be analyzed without the need for animal testing. These methods will be configured into commercially
available kits and testing services.",  ,,,,STEPHEN D DERTINGER,,(585) 442-0930,sdertinger@litronlabs.com,,  ,

entering the atmosphere. One promising version of these technologies is carbon mineralization.
Carbon mineralization reacts CO2 gas with minerals containing magnesium and/or calcium. When
CO2 reacts with these minerals, it forms solid carbonate which may be sold for use in building
materials. One plausible source of these minerals is waste produced at mining facilities. This
project aims to optimize the mineralization process with mine wastes using a two-step process: (1)
a high-temperature reaction of mine waste with a reactive salt and (2) aqueous carbonation.
Experiments in the laboratory will be followed by demonstration at a larger scale with a specialized
reaction vessel, specifically engineered to promote the optimal reaction conditions. An economic
and locational analysis of the process will reveal locations where the optimized process can be
implemented, based on the location of suitable minerals and CO2 sources. These CO2 sources can
include industrial emitters, such as power plants, facilities where CO2 is captured directly from air,
or air itself. The work proposed here will enhance the rate of carbon mineralization, as well as
provide a process to use minerals that have not been widely tested in scientific literature. This will
increase the amount of available minerals used to capture CO2. Finally, the carbonates produced
in this process can be used as value-added building materials, such as aggregate for making
cement. This can offset some of the carbon footprint associated with the cement industry.",Hai  Duong,,,,Jennifer  Wilcox,,(508) 831-6309,jlwilcox@wpi.edu,Worcester Polytechnic Institute,  ,() -

genome, which can cause seasonal or pandemic flu with high morbidity and significant mortality.
Vaccination is the most prevalent prophylactic means for controlling influenza infections. However, an
effective vaccine usually takes at least six months to develop. Furthermore, vaccination has limited
effectiveness in the treatment of immunocompromised patients, and its effectiveness is also limited
during a pandemic. The current therapeutic options for flu infections are all based on the neuraminidase
inhibitors (NAIs; oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir), while the influenza M2 ion channel blockers
(amantadine and rimantadine) are not now recommended since all of the circulating influenza strains
have acquired resistance. (Xofluza, a polymerase acidic endonuclease inhibitor, has just been approved
in 2018 and is yet untried during a flu season.) The rapid emergence of the NAI-resistant strains of
influenza A viruses strongly suggests that NAIs alone may not be sufficient as effective therapies, and
thus new treatment options targeting the other viral/host factors are urgently needed. This application
defines a plan to develop potent, small molecule inhibitors, which block entry of influenza A viruses. We
have identified compounds that inhibit entry of infectious influenza A viruses, with IC50 values in the
nanomolar range. We have synthesized structurally diverse analogs of the anti-influenza hit series using
structure-activity relationships (SARs) to improve potency and selectivity; validated the lead inhibitor
candidates in the infectious assay and investigated the mechanism of action (MOA) of the these
inhibitors; and selected anti-influenza inhibitors with excellent in vitro potency and selectivity values and
druglike in vivo pharmacokinetic properties. In this Fast Track STTR Phase I andamp;II application, we propose
four specific aims: (1) optimize the lead scaffold and select development candidates; (2) investigate the
mechanism of action (MOA) of the advanced lead compounds with HA proteins; (3) evaluate the
pharmacokinetics/toxicokinetics of the advanced lead compounds; and (4) preclinical development.Project Narrative

(FE-PTIR) imaging and spectroscopy. The proposed FE-PTIR will use fluorescence microscopy to map the distribution of
fluorescently labeled regions of cells and tissue and then provide chemical structural analysis of the labeled regions using
photothermal infrared spectroscopy. Fluorescence microscopy is a cornerstone technique in biological research, allowing
sensitive and highly specific mapping of target biomolecules within cells and tissue, but it does not provide information
about the chemical structure of those molecules. Infrared spectroscopy can provide rich analysis of chemical structure
and has been used in life sciences research to study tissue classification, drug/tissue interaction, neurodegenerative
diseases, cancer research and other areas. Conventional infrared spectroscopy, however, has a fundamental limit on its
spatial resolution (i.e. roughly how small an object it can analyze) of around 10 micrometers, similar to the size of an
average biological cell. Thus conventional infrared spectroscopy has been extremely limited for many biomedical
applications where the structures of interest are smaller than the size of a cell.
The proposed FE-PTIR technique will overcome the limitation of both fluorescence microscopy and infrared spectroscopy
to provide highly specific mapping of target biomolecules along with chemical structural analysis of those molecules, both
with the same spatial resolution as fluorescence microscopy. This project will achieve this breakthrough by using a novel
form of optical photothermal infrared spectroscopy to measure infrared spectra of fluorescently labeled regions of a
sample. Specifically, the FE-PTIR technique will illuminate a sample with an infrared laser source that can be tuned to
excite molecular vibrations a sample of interest. A separate ultraviolet/visible light source will be used for two jobs: (1) to
excite fluorescent emission in fluorescently labeled regions of the sample; and (2) measure a localized heating resulting
from absorption of infrared radiation. By measuring the intensity of fluorescent light emitted from different regions of the
sample, it is possible to map the distribution of fluorescently labeled biomolecules. Then by measuring subtle changes in
the amount of UV/visible light collected from the sample resulting from the local IR-induced heating, it is possible to
generate infrared absorption spectra of the same locations and with the same spatial resolution. The infrared absorption
spectrum can then be used to analyze the chemical structure of the fluorescently labeled regions of the sample. This
project is well aligned with NIH goals as it incorporates several key thrusts of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging
and Bioengineering, including optical imaging and spectroscopy, IR imaging, confocal microscopy, and multimodal
imaging. FE-PTIR will be extremely useful for example in localizing specific proteins with fluorescence microscopy and then
analyzing using photothermal IR spectroscopy to analyze their structure, for example how the protein is folded. Protein
misfolding is a root cause of many neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer’s) and FE-PTIR will offer new insights.
Demonstrating the FE-PTIR technology will enable a new multimodal microscope with sub-cellular resolution that will offer
profound benefits for biomedical research including neurodegenerative diseases and antimicrobial resistance research.Project narrative
Fluorescence microscopy is a cornerstone technique in biological research that maps the distribution of
fluorescently labeled biomolecules but does not provide information on their chemical structure. Infrared
spectroscopy provides detailed chemical structural analysis on biological materials, but fundamental
resolution limits have constrained its application in biology. This SBIR project will overcome these limits
to enable both mapping and chemical analysis of target biomolecules with sub-micron spatial resolution,
thus enabling research to provide fundamental insights into neurodegenerative diseases and
antimicrobial resistance.",  ,,,,CRAIG  PRATER,,(805) 680-5150,craig@photothermal.com,,  ,

Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) contribute to more than 1.5 million deaths worldwide each year and pose a
serious and continuous health risk to immunocompromised individuals. The rate of mortality associated with IFI
is high, and there are only four major classes of antifungal drugs available to treat IFI, of which the triazoles find
greatest use. Posaconazole (PCZ; Noxafil®) is the newest triazole and is the broadest spectrum, demonstrating
activity against Aspergillus, Candida and Cryptococcus species.PCZ is indicated in the U.S. for prophylaxis of invasive Aspergillus and Candida infections in patients at
high risk for these infections, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, those with hematologic
malignancies, and other immunocompromised patients. It is also indicated for treatment of oropharyngeal
candidiasis (OTC), a condition common among HIV patients. While PCZ is not associated with significant
toxicities, it displays high inter- and intra-individual variation in plasma drug concentrations, with subtherapeutic
levels associated with poor efficacy. There is significant evidence to demonstrate that inadequate exposure to
antifungals is independently associated with increased hospital mortality, and the Infectious Diseases Society of
America recommends therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of PCZ to ensure adequate treatment. Unfortunately,
there are currently no FDA approved assays available for performing PCZ TDM. Available assays remain limited
to institutions or laboratories that have developed in-house laboratory-developed tests that rely on high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or HPLC with mass spectrometry. These complex assays are
expensive and lack harmonization, making it impossible to compare results from one test to the next. Most
importantly, the turnaround time can range from several days to a week, making routine dose adjustments based
on timely results impossible. Affinergy plans to develop a novel locking assay for the direct measurement
of PCZ levels in plasma that is compatible with common clinical chemistry analyzers to facilitate routine
TDM. Our assay with its lower cost and rapid turnaround will open access to a majority of patients to ensure that
therapeutic levels are achieved to prevent life-threatening breakthrough infections and help control the rise of
resistant strains.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Invasive fungal infections contribute to more than 1.5 million deaths worldwide each year and pose a serious
and continuous health risk to immunocompromised individuals. Therapeutic drug monitoring of the triazole
antifungal, posaconazole, is recommended to ensure effective therapy, prevent mortality, and limit the
development of resistance. We propose to develop a novel assay that is compatible with common clinical
chemistry analyzers to directly measure levels of posaconazole in plasma and facilitate therapeutic drug
monitoring in routine care.",  ,,,,JONATHAN A HODGES,,(919) 433-2289,jhodges@affinergy.com,,  ,

(progesterone receptor), HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) and AR (androgen receptor), is the
breast cancer subtype with the worst prognosis, and QNBC disproportionately afflicts African
Americans. It has no standard-of-care treatment targets and thus efficacious and safe treatments must be
urgently sought for this unmet medical need, and to address the disparity in breast cancer outcomes.
The current proposal is motivated by data showing elevated expression of proteasome subunit RPN13 is
associated with both African American race and lower survival in QNBC patients, that RPN13 targeted by our
Up284 inhibitor, a strong ongoing collaboration with Dr. Karanam (TU), and the guidance of Dr. Yates (TU) in
health disparity research and Dr. Davis (Weill Cornell) in breast cancer subtypes. Both triple negative breast
cancer and QNBC cell lines show evidence of greater vulnerability to proteasome inhibitors. However, licensed
20S proteasome inhibitors, e.g. bortezomib, have proven ineffective against solid tumors, with emergence of
resistance, and dose limiting toxicities including thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. Up284 has a target and
structure designed to overcome the limitations of the licensed drugs with respect to drug resistance (Up284
blocks substrate recognition and deubiquitination rather than just one of the three 20S catalytic
activities), poor activity against solid tumors (Up284 has a novel spiro structure with evidence of
improved drug access to tumor as compared to peptide-based 20S inhibitors), key toxicities of
thrombocytopenia and neutropenia (unlike 20S inhibitors, Up284 does not target the immunoproteasome
expressed by hematopoietic cells and does not show these toxicities). Up284 shows broad anticancer
activity in vitro, including against QNBC lines with a robust therapeutic index, a promising safety profile and
pharmacodynamics, and the ability to control xenograft tumor. This promising data reflects our extensive
medicinal chemistry effort to achieve drug-like properties and a patent has been filed globally to cover the
novel backbone and lead compounds. By inhibiting proteasome ubiquitin receptor RPN13 function and its
associated deubiquitinase activity, Up284 triggers more rapid accumulation and increased molecular weight
polyubiquinated protein aggregates than is induced by 20S inhibitors. These toxic misfolded protein
aggregates produce an unresolved ER stress, activate the canonical Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)
signaling cascade and more rapidly triggers apoptosis than 20S inhibitor. The safety parameters and promising
efficacy of Up284 against breast cancer lines encourages us to validate Up284 efficacy in more QNBC lines
and xenografts, and examine key mechanistic and drug pharmacologic questions. This proposal will address
questions critical for the development of QNBC as the lead indication for our iRPN13, Up284, and to support a
pre-IND application to FDA.Quadruple Negative Breast Cancer (QNBC) is a particularly aggressive form of breast cancer that
disproportionately afflicts African Americans. Although the licensed peptide-based proteasome inhibitors are
effective against multiple myeloma, unfortunately they have not proven useful to treat solid tumors (e.g. QNBC).
Up Therapeutics is developing a novel drug with a structure designed to improve uptake into solid tumor, and
targeting a different component of the proteasome (RPN13), as candidates to better treat QNBC.",  ,,,,RAVI K ANCHOORI,,(443) 827-2083,rkanchoori@uptherapeutics.com,TUSKEGEE UNIVERSITY,  ,

The U.S. EPA has issued a lifetime drinking water Health Advisory Level (HAL) for the perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorosulfonic acid (PFOS), two of the more than 3,000 PFAS compounds, based on their potential toxicity. Many states have also developed both enforceable and non-enforceable standards and guidance values for PFAS in drinking water and groundwater. Costeffective management technologies are sought to address the estimated market of over 2,000 PFAS sites.

Conventional sorption/filtration technologies to separate PFAS from groundwater are viable for addressing PFAScontaminated groundwater; however, approaches such as sonolysis that destroy PFAS can offer a permanent solution and avoid residuals management following separation strategies. While destruction technologies for treating PFAScontaminated groundwater have been identified, their intended application is currently focused on ex situ treatment of extracted groundwater. Groundwater extraction with ex situ treatment is expensive and energy intensive.

Recent developments in horizontal well drilling and application provide a means for implementing destructive technologies in situ. Horizontal wells passively capture and focus flow from a wide capture zone upgradient of a horizontal well. RemWell has developed the InSRT reactor, which when installed within a horizontal well in situ, destroys PFAS in groundwater captured by the horizontal well using sonolysis. InSRT avoid expensive and energy-intensive pumping and incineration, and ultimately reduces a site manager's annual operating costs by 40%.

Lung fibrosis is an important step of normal lung injury-repair process. However, uncontrolled injury and repair,
and excessive deposition of collagen in the lung parenchyma is the pathological hallmark of chronic pulmonary
fibrosis, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The disease exhibits a median survival time of only 3 to 5
years from the time of diagnosis. Currently, there is no suitable drug for the treatment, except two drugs:
Nintedanib and Pirfenidone, approved by FDA. However, adverse and off-target effects, and failure to
demonstrate increased longevity in treated patients indicate the urgent need for new and better therapeutic
agent(s) to treat this devastating disease. Epithelial-mesenchymal (EM) and fibroblast-myofibroblast (FM)
transitions have been implicated in the initiation and the progression of fibrotic lung pathogenesis. The EM and
FM transition phenomena, important pathogenic events associated with cancer malignancy, are primordially and
mainly mediated by receptor-mediated tyrosine kinase (RTK) and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways. We have shown
before the elevation of phospho-MARCKS in lung cancer tissues/cells associated with EM transition and the use
of a peptide inhibitor, MPS (MARCKS PSD/ED Sequence), to suppress EM transition and lung cancer
malignancy through tackling the aberrant MARCKS-PIP3 circuit associated with cancer pathogenesis. The
elevated phospho-MARCKS phenomenon is also seen in tissue sections and isolated fibroblasts derived from
IPF lungs, but not seen in any normal, non-fiberotic ones. Our recent publication had shown the therapeutic
potential of MPS peptide in the suppression of the fibrotic lesions in bleomycin-induced fibrotic mouse lungs. In
vitro, MPS tackles the aberrant MARCKS-PIP3 circuit to suppress MARCKS phosphorylation and also selectively
inhibits the EM/FM transition and myofibroblast fibrogenesis, as well as the alteration of M1/M2 macrophage
polarization. The selectivity occurs only on IPF-derived fibroblasts and activated macrophage, but not on the
normal and inactivated monocytes. Through peptide optimization, we have developed further a stable, more
biosafe, and high potency of a novel MPS-derived peptide, MPS-6413DTM. Initial studies have shown the efficacy
of this peptide on the suppression of bleomycin-induced lung fibrotic lesions and deceased in mice, but not on
the control ones. We hypothesize that MPS-6413D is a potent anti-fibrotic lung drug on the inhibition of fibrogenic
progression of chronic lung fibrosis through tackling the MARCKS-PIP3 circuit. To test this hypothesis and the
therapeutic potential of this peptide, two aims are proposed. Aim 1 is to determine further the therapeutic effects
of MPS-6413D peptide on bleomycin induced lung fibrotic lesions in aged 32-week old (equivalent to 42 years
old human) mice. The therapeutic potency will be determined on the inhibition of the expression of profibrogenic
marker proteins and their RNA, and the inhibition of MARCKS and its phosphorylation in total lung homogenates,
matrix deposition, pulmonary function, and also the overall survival and well-being in these age mice after
bleomycin exposure. Aim 2 is to evaluate an inhibitory effect of MPS-6413D peptide on fibrogenic activity of IPF
lung fibroblasts in humanized mouse model. To better reflect clinical scenarios, IPF human lung fibroblasts
(HLFs) will be adoptively transferred to C.B-17 SCID/bg mice in order to test the therapeutic potential of MPS in
lung fibrosis. Success of these studies will lead to the submission of the Phase II SBIR study on animals with
spontaneous lung fibrosis, the pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic analysis, an IND-based study to FDA for
future clinical drug development to attenuate chronic pulmonary fibrosis.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Chronic pulmonary fibrosis, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, currently have no available
drugs for the treatment. We will test the therapeutic potency of a novel MPS-6413D peptide to
suppress chronic fibrotic mouse lungs.",  ,,,,REEN  WU,,(530) 219-1717,reenwu@gmail.com,,  ,

Falls from standing height and other low-energy trauma account for 87% of all orthopedic fractures among the
elderly. Distal radius fractures (DRF) are one of the most common types of these fractures, with approximately
40% of the more than 675,000 DRF cases reported annually in the U.S. occurring in people aged 65 years or
older. Unfortunately, these injuries result in difficulty performing the most basic daily tasks and, for elderly
patients, can lead to a loss of independence, a reduction in quality of life, and even increased mortality.
The current standard of care for DRF injuries is open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) procedures that involve
placement of metal hardware such as volar plates and/or K-wires. Results of these open surgical approaches
have been mixed; complication rates have been reported to be as high as 36% in the elderly and involve the
onset of carpal tunnel syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, and have led to tendon irritation and rupture,
deep infections, and the need to re-operate to remove the plates.
To address this issue LaunchPad Medical (LPM) has developed Tetranite® (TN), a novel bone adhesive
biomaterial that can bond bone fragments together, fill bone voids, and adhere bone to metal. Over time this
innovative material acts as a scaffold, promoting healing and allowing bone to grow through it to ultimately
replace it with new, vital bone. TN’s robust bond strength, when subjected to shear loading to the various
substrates, has been shown to be significantly greater than non-adhesive bone cements on the market. Yet
when properly mixed, TN’s flow properties make it ideal for percutaneous delivery. Uniquely, TN can be loaded
with BaSO4 without significant degradation to its mechanical properties, making it possible for a surgeon to
monitor its placement in vivo via fluoroscopy in real time and without the need for open surgery.
In Phase I of this project the TN adhesive chemistry was characterized and optimized to yield a product with
sufficient mechanical and microstructural properties to fixate upper extremity bone fractures on a stand-alone
basis (without the use of metal fixation hardware). Preliminary cadaver studies have demonstrated the effective
percutaneous treatment using the optimized formulation. Building on this successful Phase I project, and other
preliminary R and D, TN’s translation to a clinical indication for treating DRF injuries will continue in the proposed
Phase II study through the completion of the following: Aim 1: Optimization of the Percutaneous Delivery of
TN for DRF Procedures and Aim 2: Demonstration of the Safe and Effective Use of TN in a Large Animal
Study.
The results from this translational animal study, complemented with surgeon validated simulated use cadaver
testing, will be used to as the basis for filing an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) with the FDA to initiate
human studies. Long term, LPM’s mission is to provide surgeons with a novel product that will enhance fixation,
reduce complications and revision surgeries associated with DRF procedures in the elderly.",  ,,,,BRIAN  HESS,,(617) 460-6675,bhess@revbio.com,,  ,

impact (EHI) device that will aid clinicians in treating patients with peripheral artery chronic total occlusions
(CTOs). CTOs represent the complete blockage of the blood vessels and are difficult to recanalize using
traditional percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) techniques and apparatus. The presence of
calcifications and fibrotic tissues within CTOs, together with the vessel size and tortuosity, are the causes of
multiple complications during treatment. Therefore, a significant number of CTOs are treated using an invasive
bypass surgery, which has significant morbidity and requires extensive recovery time. The central challenge to
catheter based nonsurgical percutaneous CTO treatment is that it often is incredibly difficult to cross the
calcified and resistant chronic blockage with an angioplasty wire. Although efforts have been made to use
excimer lasers or rotational atherectomy devices (rotablator), these plaque modification devices require a wire
to cross the CTO, which limits their utility if no wire crossing is established. To address this clinically important
problem of difficult CTO crossing, Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) in collaboration with Brigham and Womenandapos;s
Hospital (BWH) and Impact Vascular (IVAS) proposes to develop and pre-clinically evaluate a novel and safer
method and device for CTO management. The proposed device uses an electrohydraulic impactor that creates
a directed impact pressure of several hundred bar to penetrate the CTO plaque without damaging normal elastic
arterial tissue. Therefore, EHI will facilitate CTO crossing and distal guide-wire passage to enable definitive
treatment with balloons and stents.Project Narrative
Globally more than 200 million people suffer from peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and the number

This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a ""DC-COV19"" probe system to eradicate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which killed more than 400,000 people in the United States. Our long-term goal is to develop a potent COVID-19 T cell-based immunotherapy (vaccine-like) for high-risk populations to stop or reduce SARS-CoV-2 infections. The SARS-CoV-2 vaccines target neutralizing antibodies but only rely on the endogenous production of T cells. Major Gap: COVID-19 patients showed a significant reduction in the number and function of T cells and required robust vaccine or immunotherapeutic strategies to boost SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. NeyroblastGX LLC (NGL) proposes to develop a probe from dendritic cells (DCs) derived from established genetically engineered human embryonic stem cells (hESC) transfected with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Sp). This ""DC-COV19"" probe will be used to produce high numbers of functional SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells ex vivo. Autologous immune T cells will be transferred into COVID-19 patients as a rapid and robust adaptive T cell-based immunotherapy. NGL works with world-class immunologists and clinicians to develop several Sp constructs engineered to transfect DCs to selectively activate SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to fight COVID-19.

cancer. Advanced techniques such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), image-guided RT (IGRT),
stereotactic body RT (SBRT) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) improve outcomes and are delivered using
medical linear accelerators (i.e., ‘linacs”). SBRT is especially appealing given that the precise treatments are
delivered in 1-5 daily treatment fractions, as opposed to the 20-40 fractions required for conventional
techniques. Providing SBRT in rural settings can improve access by administering these precise, abbreviated
treatments to patients who have difficulty traveling to large, regional medical centers. Further, adoption of
automated techniques for quality control and enhanced tele-dosimetry can support peer review, improve
quality, reduce dependence on (local) expertise and reduce operating costs.The quality assurance (QA) that medical physicists provide is critical for safe treatments, yet there is a
shortage of qualified medical physicists (QMPs), both in the US and globally. At the same time, more centers
are introducing modern techniques that are more precise but intrinsically have more risk, due the high doses
and geometric precision required. There is widespread noncompliance with industry standard QA protocols in
the US and internationally. Existing QA devices have not evolved sufficiently to provide the precision, versatility
and efficiency that is needed for high precision RT. Given these exacerbated safety risks, the market needs a
paradigm shift in how QA is performed in modern RT.Wild Dog Physics (WDP) proposes to design and test a new-generation QA device that addresses these
unmet medical needs. When complete, it will be more precise, efficient, and comprehensive than any QA
solution currently on the market. The proposed project seeks to develop a clinical prototype to be tested in the
Radiation Therapy clinic at the University of Kentucky, as well as regional partner organizations located in
rural, underserved areas. The prototype will be developed using the following milestones: Design and build i)
a novel, a small-form-factor optical tunnel (SFFOT), ii) a laminated side wall with a scintillating phosphor
screen and ‘switchable film’ outer layer to facilitate ambient light rejection and iii), a hybrid beam quality /
compact CT phantom. The project will culminate with the construction of an integrated prototype that will be
tested for technical and clinical performance.Towards this end, the specific aims of this project are:
Specific Aim 1: Build and test the 3 primary subcomponents of an integrated device; a) a SFFOT that can
collect an image(s) of the entire useful interior surface, transmit the image(s) to an electronic camera sensor
through a small form-factor (lt 5 cm diameter) passive optical chain; b) a laminated side wall consisting of an
outer, electronically polarizing optical layer, and an inner radio-luminescent layer, and c) a hybrid ‘dose
phantom’ to be integrated onto one side of the device which will serve as a tissue-equivalent phantom so that
beam quality metrics can be monitored and to host CT image quality test objects.
Specific Aim 2: Construct and test a clinical prototype; The system’s ability to monitor machine performance in
a clinical setting will be validated. Sensitivity to detecting changes in relative and absolute radiation output, as
well as field edge positioning will be measured, with success criteria defined as 0.5% and 0.5 mm. Data
acquisition time for monthly QA tests will be measured and success defined as less than 30 minutes.The consolidation of multiple device functions combined with the ease of use and measurement
precision enable a paradigm shift in how medical physics services and quality assurance are rendered. Sparse
but efficient daily QA protocols will be replaced with comprehensive data collection and automated analysis, at
no additional cost in time or staffing. High precision radiation treatments can be safely brought to rural and
underserved areas, with safety, efficiency and precision improved in any center using the innovation.To date, we have established the feasibility of constructing a single device that can acquire
comprehensive QA metrics in less than 60 minutes. Presently, all subsystems have been tested and found to
perform as required. A three-dimensional prototype has been built and is being validated by our clinical
partner at the UK Radiation Medicine department. WDP is in the process of seeking SBIR Phase 2 funding to
further develop the technology to the point of commercialization.",  ,,,,JANELLE A MOLLOY,,(859) 257-7616,janelle.molloy@wilddogphysics.com,,  ,

Teliatry proposes to build world’s smallest (0.75cc), most cost-effective, minimally invasive single
incision surgery, 16-channel, rechargeable, Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS) system to bring proven
SCS therapy to mainstream chronic pain management. It eliminates the need for creating an IPG
pocket, eliminates tunneling, exploits a novel shape memory polymer (SMP)lead that can be inserted
percutaneously without altering current surgical technique but “unrolls” into a paddle in epidural space. It
also softens to conform to the epidural space mitigating issues with lead migration and lead breakage. The
electrodes on the paddle are high surface area, low polarization, fractal topology Titanium Nitride (TiN) that
further reduce the energy required by up to 70% of percutaneous cylindrical electrodes. This in turn reduces
the battery capacity requirement and allows us to exploit a miniature, multi-stack solid state battery (SSB)
architecture that is manufactured at wafer level on a glass substrate. It is intrinsically safe, MRI compatible
and has extremely high charge andamp; discharge rate (20C) and high recharge cycle (2000+) equating to 10+
years lifetime. This further eliminates the need for repeat battery replacement surgery every few years. In
recent times, miniature, battery less SCS systems have entered the market but they limit patients comfort
and lifestyle by forcing external power andamp; communications module(PCM) to be worn at all times and also
have issues with alignment of the PCM with the implant for proper power coupling. Our proposed system is
even smaller than these batteries less system and with an average recharge time of andlt;10 minute/day in the
worst case, it eliminates the external wearable PCM and long recharge cycles wait time that hinder patient’s
lifestyle. In addition, our systems low production costs due to parallel fabrication of multiple implants on one
glass wafer will improve the short-term cost effectiveness (currently @ 40%) to its long term cost
effectiveness (80%) making this a mainstream electroceutical for pain management and in turn reducing
dependence on Opioids for chronic pain sufferers. We will perform feasibility study on all critical
components and aspects of the system architecture in Phase 1 allowing us to build a successful prototype
during Phase 2. We propose a system design including IPG architecture, battery and lead design that are
all based on our proven technology and will enable us to realize a novel SCS system by synergistically
combining advantages and on-going advancements of these core technologies 1) glass IPG, 2) glass SSB,
3)new softening and unrolling leads. SCS therapy for chronic back pain is our prime target specially
because there is high level of evidence for safety, efficacy, and long-term cost-effectiveness of SCS with
more than half of all patients experiencing sustained and significant levels of pain reduction following SCS
treatment. We believe we will not only bring SCS to mainstream pain management, but our modular
technology platform will impact the entire neuromodulation industry.Project Narrative
Teliatry, Inc., proposes to build the smallest (0.75cc), rechargeable, cost-effective, minimally invasive, 16

The lack of a means to quantify soft tissue manipulation (STM) motion and dose as delivered in the clinic is a
critical problem in the reproducibility and therapeutic potential of this non-invasive and non-pharmacological
modality. STM is a form of manual therapy used to evaluate and treat musculoskeletal pain, inflammation, and
dysfunction. Different soft tissue forces have differing biological effects and outcomes. Evidence suggests STM
may serve as a surrogate or augment to exercise, which has important implications in rehabilitation. Like exercise,
objective parameters are needed for optimal STM dosing. However, initial research indicates a high level of
inconsistency in STM force application, both within and between therapists, while quantitative feedback significantly
improves its accuracy and consistency. Unfortunately, current STM practice relies mostly on subjective treatment
variables and vague descriptors of soft tissue quality and pain. Unwarranted variation in assessment and treatment
can compromise outcomes and diminish the value of the practice. There is a strong need for technology that can
generate STM metrics to improve practice by providing a common language to optimize STM examination and
intervention, enable dose prescriptions, facilitate training, study its effects, and evaluate outcomes.Our team has developed a novel medical device system, Quantifiable Soft Tissue Manipulation (QSTM™)
as a solution to address this void in manual therapy. QSTM™ includes a device (Q1) for the application and
sensing of localized forces in smaller regions (e.g., finger or elbow) and another device (Q2) for dispersive forces
in larger regions (e.g., back or thigh), along with custom software for recording and analysis of treatment data,
including STM force magnitude, angle, rate, and direction. The primary purpose of this proposal is to
demonstrate the feasibility of QSTM™ for clinical use. The central hypothesis is that QSTM™ will improve the
reproducibility of STM examination and intervention. Project objectives aim to optimize the design of the device
system; quantitatively characterize basic STM stroke motion patterns; test the reliability of STM force application
using QSTM™ data output; and determine its usability for pain assessment. A large market exists for use of
QSTM™ in multiple health disciplines, sports, education, research, and veterinary medicine. People and payers
seeking precise, patient-centric care will eventually drive the market. QSTM™ represents a significant improvement
over its competition of traditional manual methods, with or without rigid instruments, or mimetic devices. QSTM™
offers an alternative or complement to other approaches. We have consulted with experts on our business model
and marketing and sales strategies. This project aligns with the National Center of Complementary and Integrative
Health priorities. NIH support will accelerate commercialization. QSTM™ is to manual therapy what the Fitbit is to
exercise. QSTM™ better enables individualized rehabilitation through objective measures and goal setting,
recording, monitoring, and reproducibility. This progressive technology will integrate patient feedback and clinician
perception with quantitative metrics, creating a positive shift to the digital era of soft tissue manual therapy practice.PROJECT NARRATIVE
The lack of a means to quantify soft tissue manipulation (STM), a form of manual therapy, is a critical barrier to the
reproducibility and optimization of this non-invasive and non-pharmacological modality in the management of acute

Using a novel fermentation process, called the WheyAway, Capro-X converts lactose-containing dairy industry process streams into treated water and a mixture of valuable fatty acid chemicals. The WheyAway provides a promising opportunity to solve waste issues experienced by the dairy industry both in the US and abroad. The company envisions an initial multi-sided revenue model: installing and operating WheyAway systems through Treatment as a Service (TaaS) contracts to a beachhead market of Greek yogurt producers; and selling fatty acids as sustainable specialty chemicals targeted to the flavor and fragrance industry. With economies of scale, Capro-X will pivot away from the servicebased model and towards a managed biorefinery model of purchasing dairy byproducts and upcycling them to useful chemicals, as well as system sales and licensing.

In the recently completed Phase 1 project, Capro-X significantly improved the WheyAway process by: a) validating a novel high performance bioreactor architecture, which will increase fatty acid production and waste treatment rates; demonstrating the ability to valorize mixed wastes from dairy plants containing lactose and sucrose, which will expand addressable market opportunities; and identifying opportunities to improve extraction chemistry to harvest fatty acids at higher rates, which will increase overall bioprocess productivity and market value for the food ingredient industry.

With award of this Phase 2 project, Capro-X will scale the entire bioprocess by 10x from the bench-scale, optimize operating conditions and reactor dimensions for the novel bioreactor architecture, evaluate optimal conditions for treating mixed plant dairy wastes, and identify optimal extraction chemistry to maximize extraction rates of fatty acids. With these improvements, Capro-X is confident that the research efforts will be directly implemented into the first commercial WheyAway installation, which is planned to be installed at a local Greek yogurt plant at the close of this Phase 2 project in 2023. Upon entering the market, Capro-X expects to: save early Greek yogurt customers at least 25% on their current expense, entirely eliminate diesel consumption due to trucking production wastes hours off-site, increase water reuse opportunities by producing potable water from the WheyAway output, decrease dependence on foreign oleochemicals, and provide training and development opportunities in rural areas of the US.",April  Richards,SBIR Program Manager,(202) 564-6462,richards.april@epa.gov,Juan J Guzman,CEO,(508) 353-9514,guzman.juan@capro-x.com,,  ,

range of pathologies. One of the most common procedures is heart valve replacement and is required when the
valve fails due to regurgitation or is unable to open fully during the cardiac cycle. Causes include congenital
defects, calcification and prolapse, but regardless of origin there are limited options to repair valves and surgical
treatments are focused primarily on replacement. It is estimated that each year more than 150,000 patients
receive heart valve replacements at a mean cost of ~$200,000 per procedure, corresponding to andgt;$30B cost to
the healthcare system. The heart valve market has continued to grow over the past decade due to advances in
surgical and minimally-invasive technologies associated with heart valve placement. However, current valves
represent some compromise in fit, biological performance, durability and surgical procedure, with unique
advantages and disadvantages associated with current mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valves. In this
proposal our objective is to develop a new bioprosthetic heart valve using advanced manufacturing approaches
that has the durability of mechanical valves, the non-thrombogenicity of biologic valves, the soft deformability for
minimally-invasive transcatheter delivery, and the ability to custom fit the anatomy of any patient. To do this
FluidForm, Inc in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University will develop a new freeform reversible embedding
of suspended hydrogels (FRESH) 3D printed heart valve using collagen type I that recreates the laminar and
anisotropic extracellular matrix (ECM) architecture in native valves. Our preliminary data shows that FRESH 3D
printing can be used to manufacture functional tri-leaflet heart valves entirely from collagen and can support
physiologic flow rates and pressure for short periods of time. Here we will improve valve performance by
recreating the collagen fiber arrangement and mechanical properties in native valve leaflets via two research
aims. First, we will demonstrate that FRESH 3D printing of collagen type I can recreate the collagen fiber
architecture in the different layers of the native aortic valve leaflets with andlt;10% difference in mean orientation
angle. Second, we will prove that FRESH 3D printed collagen valve leaflets can be engineered to have radial
and circumferential elastic modulus, non-linear stress-strain response, creep, and fatigue life within 75% of native
aortic valve leaflets. Phase I proof-of-concept success will provide a strong foundation for a Phase II SBIR project
that will validate the complete FRESH printed, bioprosthetic aortic valve in an in vitro flow system that simulates
human pressure and flow rate and in a pre-clinical ovine model to assess hemocompatibility and biological
response.Each year more than 150,000 patients receive a replacement heart valve at a mean cost of ~$200,000 per
procedure, corresponding to andgt;$30B cost to the healthcare system. However, current valves represent some
compromise in fit, biological performance, durability and surgical procedure, and some patients are not
candidates due to high surgical risk. Here we will develop a new bioprosthetic heart valve using advanced

The research project outlined in this SBIR submission will develop the Realize, Analyze, Engage (RAE)
platform into a tool to promote sustained recovery in individuals receiving treatment for substance use disorder.
In this proposal, the investigators intend to deploy the RAE system- consisting of a wearable sensor, a
smartphone app, and a clinical portal- to provide individuals in recovery and their treatment providers with an
opportunity to identify moments of high risk for relapse and to access real time intervention opportunities.
Wearable biosensors are small, noninvasive devices that continuously record physiology. These sensors have
the ability to detect digital biomarkers of drug use and stress, the latter of which herald an increased risk of
relapse. RAE aims to utilize this capability to create a real-time solution for individuals in recovery. The
components of RAE are: 1) The Empatica Embrace, a wrist mounted sensor similar in form factor to a smart
watch, that continuously monitors skin temperature, electrodermal activity (EDA) and locomotion. Detection
algorithms for stress and drug use will be embedded on the Embrace firmware. 2) The RAE smartphone
application (app), for the individual in recovery. The app will be triggered either by detection of an event on the
Embrace or manually by the user when needed and will provide multiple options for annotations, stress
reduction techniques and immediate contact with individuals in the pre-defined support system via call or SMS
text. The app will also log sleep, physical activity, and geographic location of events. 3) The RAE Portal, for
the treatment provider, will deliver immediate alerts when an event is detected on the user’s device for the
opportunity to intervene in real time and will also provide metrics on the user’s recorded activities. The
research plan has two Specific Aims: Aim 1) To deploy and optimize the RAE system in a population of
individuals in treatment for substance use disorder and Aim 2) To demonstrate the impact of the RAE system
on outcomes in substance use treatment. To achieve these aims the investigators will first deploy the
technology in a population of individuals in recovery and collect data on accuracy, usability and functionality
(Aim 1). The data from Aim 1 will be used to optimize the system and achieve millstones prior to transition to
Aim 2 which will include sensitivity, specify, accuracy and user compliance targets. The investigators will then
undertake a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (Aim 2) to evaluate the efficacy of RAE on key outcomes
including rates of relapse, retention in treatment programs, and psychosocial wellbeing. The investigators
have assembled a leadership team and advisory team with the necessary expertise in business, medicine,
wearable technology and engineering to develop RAE into a tool that dramatically improves the success of
treatment for substance use disorder, promotes sustained sobriety, and reduces morbidity and mortality from
relapse to substance use.",  ,,,,MEGAN R REINHARDT,,(207) 380-6197,meganr@raehealth.com,,  ,

Nearly half of
all pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended, and globally there are rt85 million unintended pregnancies and 2
million new HIV infections each year. Not surprisingly, unintended pregnancies occur most often in women
who are non-users of contraception: many women are averse to using exogenous hormones due to real and
perceived side effects, and frequently discontinue hormonal contraception. This underscores the need for a
non-hormonal contraceptive method that does not require coitally-timed actions, nor daily intervention. We
believe adding contraception to an HIV prevention method would also strongly improve user adherence, since
few couples self-identify as at risk of HIV, while nearly all self-identify as at risk of pregnancy.Inspired by nature, where some infertile women express antibodies that bind surface antigens on sperm
and block sperm penetration through their cervical mucus, we have investigated a fully human monoclonal
antibody (mAb) that can quickly bind a unique antigen present only on the surface of human sperm; we refer
to this mAb as human contraceptive antibody (HCA). Importantly, HCA agglutinated rt90% of sperm within
seconds in all 100 fresh semen samples tested from men spanning diverse demographics. A similiar mAb that
binds rabbit sperm reduced egg fertilization by ~95% in the highly fertile rabbit model. Major strides have been
made with discovering and testing broadly neutralizing mAb (bnAb) against HIV, including protection against
vaginal HIV transmission. Indeed, members of our team led the first clinical trial of VRC01 delivered vaginally.To realize the vision of a mAb-based MPT product, the next step in our development is to (i) formulate
mAb into a delivery system that maintains effective levels of mAb in the female reproductive tract, and (ii)
further validate efficacy in large animal models. Thus, during Phase I of this Fast-Track application, we will
formulate sustained release polymeric capsules encapsulating a cocktail of mAbs (HCA and VRC01+N6 for
HIV prevention), and can be embedded into intravaginal rings (IVR). The goal is to demonstrate that loaded
mAbs will remain sufficiently stable and active (neutralize/trap HIV and agglutinate/trap sperm) when exposed
and released into human cervicovaginal secretions over a 35 day period. Pending successful completion of
Phase I milestone, we will perform repeated low-dose vaginal SHIV challenges to confirm if mAb released from
the engineered polymeric capsules can effectively reduce vaginal transmission. If successful, our proposed
work will strongly support clinical development of our combination contraceptive and HIV-prevention MPT-IVR
that could address a major unmet need in the marketplace.",  ,,,,KEIICHIRO  KUSHIRO,,(919) 813-8691,kushiro@mucommune.com,,  ,

Monitoring fish health for earlydetection of diseases is paramount to secure a safe and sustainable aquaculture industry.Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a promising tool that has not yet delivered its disruptive potentialfor aqualcuture health moniring. While sensitive and reliable eDNA detection techniques such asPCR are widely available the major limitation today is the quality and reliability of eDNAsampling techniques in aquaculture environments. Current sampling tools still use nitrocellulosefilters that are not designed for that purpose. As a result the sampling effort is significant and thecollected samples contain low eDNA concentrations and high amount of PCR inhibitors resultingin unreliable disease detection. In this SBIR Phase I proposal we offer the demonstration of thefeasibility and proofof concept of a novel eDNA sorbent kit that relies on chemical affinity-basedeDNA sorption rather than size exclusion used by conventional techniques.

Members of this
family are known to be persistent and bioaccumulative. PFAS are associated with unfavorable health outcomes
in human and animal models. Several public health agencies as well as scientists have published articles that
indicate the presence of PFAS in human blood, serum, milk, cord blood, and tissues. Currently, detection of
about a dozen of these chemicals out of more than a thousand of this class is performed using LCMS/MS.
However, prior to analysis many purification steps are required to eliminate interfering species. Furthermore, the
necessity of internal standards for the detection of PFAS, and the lack of pertinent internal standards dramatically
reduces the scope of PFAS-detection. Currently, PFAS testing is a lengthy and costly undertaking that
represents a major scientific bottleneck. Thus, there is an urgent need for a real-time detection technology that
can sense a broad range of PFAS without pretreatment of sample, or expensive instrumentation. Implementation
of such a product will allow better understanding of the fate of PFAS within the environment and their impact on
human health.This proposal’s objective is to develop the pre-treatment free detection of PFAS in environmental matrices by
coupling the key fluorous phase property with a highly sensitive fluorescence technology. In phase 1, we will
apply the specific fluorous-fluorous interaction strategy to provide the adequate selectivity to preclude any
associated purification steps. Fluorous tethered fluorescent dyes will be covalently immobilized on a glass
surface. Initially, prior to exposure to PFAS, these fluorescent dyes will exist as excimers resulting from their
close proximity to each other, the fluorescent probe turns the fluorescence on. Upon exposure to PFAS analytes,
the analytes will be sequestered to the fluorous region of the probe due to specific fluorous-fluorous affinity. This
will cause a physical disruption of the excimers, resulting in the fluorescence turn off of the excimer and a
simultaneous turn on of the monomer emission. To achieve the proposed goal, in phase I the following specific
aims will be pursued: specific aim1: 1) attachment of the fluorescent dye to the fluorous molecule, 2)
immobilization of fluorous-dye array on glass surface, and 3) evaluation of fluorescence on-off of fluorous-dye
glass surface with PFAS-samples. Ultimately the approach developed here will lay the groundwork for the
development of a product that is expected to enable a broad range of researchers to study many types of effects
on human health caused by PFAS.Project Narrative
Rapid detection and quantification of PFAS is an immediate need for better understanding their properties such
as their partition in different environmental matrices, health risks, exposure routes, fate and transportation, etc.
In order to drive advancement of such study a novel approach will be applied for generation of chip-based PFAS
sensors that can rapidly detect and quantify a broad range of PFAS in environmental matrices such as ground
water, surface water, soil, etc. This technique is eventually expected to lead to a portable device that can enable
the generation of bountiful information that will facilitate regulatory decision making, monitoring of PFAS sources,
and ultimately reducing future exposures that benefit society.",  ,,,,ANURADHA  SINGH,,(405) 740-3165,anuradha.singh@weaver-labs.com,,  ,

related deaths were estimated at over 9.6 million. Of these cases, the vast majority were solid tumors, accounting
for more than 16 million new cases and 8 million cancer deaths. This includes soft tissue sarcoma (STS), a
heterogeneous group of aggressive malignant tumors that have a poor 5-year survival rate of only 65%. In the
U.S., an estimated 13,000 people will be diagnosed with STS in 2020, and more than 5,000 will die of the
disease. For patients diagnosed with STS, treatment often involves chemotherapy with a cytotoxic agent such
as doxorubicin (Dox), an anthracycline that has been used to induce tumor regression in a variety of neoplastic
conditions. Dox is also known to induce immunogenic cell death and enhance tumor responsiveness to immune
checkpoint blockade therapies. Unfortunately, the extended use of Dox in patients is limited by severe toxic side
effects—most notably irreversible cardiotoxicity and bone marrow suppression—which can be life threatening.
Therefore, there is an immediate need for new methods to reduce the systemic toxicity and off-target effects of
Dox while maintaining its antitumor efficacy Shasqi has developed SQ3370, a novel drug product that will
improve the treatment of patients with injectable solid tumors undergoing doxorubicin (Dox)-based
chemotherapy. Preclinical studies done to-date have shown that SQ3370 results in significant inhibition of
tumor growth (both injected and non-injected tumors), immune activation, prolonged survival, and
protection against tumor rechallenge, while exhibiting reduced systemic side effects compared to
conventional Dox. Extensive preclinical data with SQ3370 has led to an open investigational new drug (IND)
application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A Phase 1, first-in-human, dose-escalation study
is currently enrolling, to evaluate the safety/tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of SQ3370 in patients with
locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This Direct-to-Phase-2 application has two main objectives: 1) To
gain additional mechanistic insight of SQ3370 immune activation to support further clinical development; 2) To
support both clinical and commercial development through manufacturing process optimization and stability
studies, that is further described in 5 Specific Aims. These aims will accelerate development of SQ3370, a novel
therapy that promises to ultimately result in improved treatment and outcomes for millions of patients with solid

Hemoglobin (Hb) disorders are among the worldandapos;s most common monogenic diseases. Nearly 7% of the
world’s population carry Hb gene variants. Sickle cell disease (SCD) arises when Hb mutations are inherited
homozygously (HbSS) or paired with another β-globin gene mutation. Globally, an estimated 400,000 babies
are born annually with SCD, and 70%-75% are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is estimated that 50-90% in
SSA die by their 5th birthday, 70% of these deaths are preventable. Effective management of SCD involves
early diagnosis, and genetic counselling, and, importantly, nationwide newborn screening (NBS). NBS
programs utilizing centralized laboratories have dramatically reduced SCD mortality in high-resource countries.
NBS requires sensitive detection of relatively low levels of Hb variants in the presence of high fetal Hb (HbF).
Normal HbA and sickle HbS should be accurately identified in the presence of high levels (up to 90%) of HbF.
The current gold standard for Hb variant testing is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which
requires expensive equipment and reagents, highly trained personnel, and modern laboratories. In low-
resource regions, very few centralized laboratories can perform costly Hb testing. Testing is not available to the
large percentage of infants born outside of a major hospital or city. There is an unmet need for affordable,
portable, easy-to-use, accurate, point-of-care (POC) tests to facilitate decentralized Hb testing to enable
nationwide NBS programs. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed Hb electrophoresis as an
essential in vitro diagnostic in low- and middle-income countries. We have developed a POC microchip
electrophoresis Hb variant testing system, MicroChip Electrophoresis (MCE), under the product name “Gazelle
Hb Variant” by Hemex Health, Inc. MCE reports Hb phenotype, Hb quantification (%Hb), and an interpretive
statement showing genotype (such as SCD, Sickle Cell Trait, or Normal). MCE has been extensively validated
for hemoglobinopathies, including SCD, hemoglobin E disease, and thalassemia. Newborns and infants below
6 weeks of age have very low concentrations of Hb variants other than Hb F which is high, therefore an
improvement to lower the limit of detection (LoD) is needed to support NBS programs worldwide. By
decreasing the LoD from the current 10% to 2%, newborns and infants can be screened with this affordable
system. The innovation in this SBIR Phase I is the integration of multi-spectral imaging and machine learning based
data analysis capability to MCE to develop MCE+ to accurately screen newborns for common Hb variants. We
propose the following aims: Aim 1: Integrate multi-spectral imaging and machine learning algorithm into the
MCE platform to enable identification and quantification of hemoglobin variants in newborns. Aim 2: Perform
clinical testing of the MCE+ multi-spectral newborn screening system. Significance of this project is that MCE+ is
the only affordable POC system for quantitative and objective hemoglobin variant testing that allows screening at
birth.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Up to 50 to 90% of children born with sickle cell disease (SCD) in economically disadvantaged
countries (over 400,000 per year) die before the age of five, although the WHO estimates that 70% could be
saved through simple, cost-effective treatments. Early diagnosis starting at birth is critical for implementing
effective disease management, but newborn screening is a challenge for low resource environments where a
decentralized, point-of-care solution is needed. This project enables our affordable, point-of-care platform based
on microchip electrophoresis technology to accurately perform newborn screening.",  ,,,,PETER  GALEN,,(503) 560-5607,p.galen@hemexhealth.com,,  ,

This combination of factors has limited the adoption of composite materials in mass markets such as construction and automotive, despite strong demand for lightweight solutions. This project proposes implementation of low-cost composite materials in construction products is projected to reduce the lifecycle cost of utility and infrastructure projects through a combination of lower initial installation costs and lower service and maintenance costs over the life of the installed equipment. In automotive applications, vehicle weight reduction translates to reduced energy consumption, meaning better fuel economy in combustion vehicles or improved electric vehicle range, both of which reduce pollution. Weight reduction, enabled by lightweight composite materials, is a significant component of automaker compliance strategy, as a 10% vehicle weight reduction can achieve a 6-8% fuel economy improvement. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project involves the design, fabrication, and testing of a continuous composite forming machine that uses ultrasonic welding to achieve high throughput of composite materials. Replacing infrared heating for thermoplastic consolidation with ultrasonic welding can achieve an 82-85% reduction in embodied energy (energy per unit mass of material produced), while matching or exceeding the production speed of the infrared system. The research activities proposed for Phase II will translate the embodied energy reductions into production speed improvements through the fabrication and testing of a next-generation continuous composite forming machine that is suitable for high-volume automotive production, with the goal of demonstrating a minimum production capacity of 250,000 door-panel-sized units per year. The key objectives to be addressed are: 1) scale-up and integration of a continuous ultrasonic welding system, 2) fabrication of a 1-meter-wide production machine capable of composite production at a line speed of 200 linear meters per hour, and 3) implementation of process controls suitable for automotive quality standards.

Treatment requires neutralization of acidity followed by precipitation and management of the metals. Conventional mine water treatment systems use lime (CaO) or caustic (NaOH) to generate acid-neutralizing alkalinity. The high cost of these conventional technologies has contributed to the bankruptcies of hundreds of mining companies and significantly limited the ability of public reclamation groups to treat polluted mine water at abandoned sites. Lime and caustic are mature technologies and there is little opportunity for substantial cost-decreasing technical advances.

Limestone (CaCO3) is a commonly available alkaline material that can provide acid neutralization at 1/8 to 1/40 the cost of lime and caustic, respectively. However, limestone’s use is subject to solubility and kinetic constraints that limit its application to a small subset of the Nation’s mine water problems. The Phase I project investigated whether these constraints could be overcome through carbonation of the mine water. The limestone+CO2 technology that was developed was able to double concentrations of alkalinity produced from limestone and quadruple that rate of alkalinity generation. The Phase I findings were implemented at an existing underperforming limestone treatment system where carbonation was able to produce an alkaline discharge from the limestone system for the first time in 30 years. The results indicate that carbonation could improve the treatment effectiveness of existing limestone systems and significantly decrease the size and cost of future limestone systems.

Phase II will advance the technology by developing an improved carbonator device and applying the technology to low pH mine water contaminated with ferric iron, aluminum, and toxic metals. The limestone+CO2 technology will be demonstrated at four full-scale under performing limestone treatment systems in Pennsylvania and at an experimental system at a metal mine site in southwestern Colorado.

The customers for the limestone+CO2 technology are local, state, and federal mine reclamation programs, non-profit watershed restoration groups, private mining companies, and engineering companies that design treatment plants. The technology will compete with lime and caustic based on price. The Phase I results suggest that the primary cost driver for the technology is CO2 utilization and price. Phase II will increase the efficiency of CO2 utilization. CO2 availability and price will be determined through a market analysis that relates potential sources of industrialquality CO2 to acid mine drainage producing regions in the US and provides pricing for various production and transportation scenarios.",April  Richards,SBIR Program Manager,(202) 564-6462,richards.april@epa.gov,Robert S Hedin,President,(412) 571-2204,bhedin@hedinenv.com,,  ,

This proposal focuses on translation of ice-free cryopreservation by vitrification employing a novel approach of
volumetric heating by nanowarming using Fe nanoparticles in an alternating electromagnetic ?eld. Vitrification,
sub-zero storage below the glass transition temperature in a “glassy” rather than a crystalline frozen phase, is
a form of cryopreservation that avoids ice formation. Vitri?cation can be achieved by quickly cooling the
material to cryogenic storage temperatures, where ice cannot form. Vitri?cation can be maintained at the end
of the cryogenic protocol by quickly rewarming the tissue to temperatures above the temperatures where ice
nucleation may occur. The magnitude of the rewarming rates necessary to maintain vitri?cation is much higher
than the magnitude of the cooling rates that are required to achieve it in the ?rst place. The most common
approach to achieve the required cooling and rewarming rates is by convection based boundary warming in
which the the specimen's surface is exposed to a temperature controlled environment, such as a fluid bath.
Due to the underlying principles of heat transfer, there is a size limit in the case of surface boundary heating
beyond which crystallization cannot be prevented at the center of the specimen. Furthermore, due to the
underlying principles of solid mechanics, there is also a size limit beyond which thermal expansion in the
specimen can lead to structural damage and fractures. Volumetric heating by nanowarming during the
rewarming phase of the cryogenic protocol can alleviate these size limitations. Vitrification is already an
important enabling approach for reproductive medicine with the potential to permit storage and transport of
cells, tissues and organs for a great variety of biomedical uses. Unfortunately, practical application of
vitrification has been limited to smaller systems such as cells and thin tissues due to diffusive and phase
change limitations that preclude use for blood vessels, larger tissues and organs. To circumvent this problem
we demonstrated that nanowarming effectively rewarms blood vessels in our preliminary research. Our
experiments demonstrated that this innovative rewarming technique rewarmed vitrified femoral and carotid
arteries in volumes ranging from 1 to 50mL with retention of cell viability and physiologic function.
However, warming of thick arteries was suboptimal. We propose using large animal blood vessel, models
for further optimization and evaluation of nanowarmed vessels using a combination of in vitro and in vivo
studies. In Phase 1 in a single specific aim we will optimize ice-free vitrification of thick walled arteries,
aorta and pulmonary, with a go/no go objective of achieving rt 90% viability for progression to Phase 2. In
Phase 2 specific aims, we propose using porcine vascular models in a combination of ex vivo and in vivo
studies. The magnetic nanoparticles will be distributed around and within the internal spaces of vessels.
The large vessel lumen space makes them a good choice for optimization of vitrification and
nanowarming. In Aim 1 we will evaluate cryopreserved arteries after real time shipping, comparing methods
and validating the transport conditions that are finally approved based upon absence of tissue cracking. In Aim
2 we will characterize the post-ice-free cryopreservation state of arteries preserved for at least 2 years. In
addition, during this aim we will characterize the chemistry and biomaterial properties of ice-free
cryopreserved blood vessels. Effective vitrification will be evaluated using cryomacroscopy to detect ice
formation and cryoprotectant residuals by Raman spectroscopy. In Aim 3 we will perform short-term
transplant studies (28 days) in two porcine vascular models (femoral and pulmonary artery into the carotid
and pulmonary, respectively) in order to validate our technology for a future Phase IIb SBIR proposal using
clinically relevant preclinical non-human primate models and human tissues.",  ,,,,KELVIN G BROCKBANK,,(843) 514-6164,kgbrockbankassoc@aol.com,,  ,

The goal of this project is to develop a novel oral drug, R-5780, which engages microbiome-associated Pattern
Recognition Receptors (PRRs) to enhance the activity of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy for the
treatment of cancer. R-5780 is based on a unique enzyme known as secreted antigen A (SagA) identified from
Enterococcus faecium which our research team showed can engage microbiome-associated immunological
pathways of the gut and potentiate the effects of PD-1 and CTLA4 pathway targeting agents [19, 29, 30].
Gut microbiota are associated with remarkable effects on host health and disease, and discrete species of
commensal bacteria have been correlated with improved patient responses to cancer immunotherapy [7-14]. The
molecular mechanisms underlying these beneficial bacterial effects remain poorly understood. In particular,
specific strains of Enterococci have been linked with improved response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in
patients with metastatic melanoma, lung, and kidney cancers, but their mechanism of action has not been
elucidated nor employed to improve cancer immunotherapy. Recent work from our laboratory demonstrated
that these beneficial strains of Enterococci express the SagA peptidoglycan remodeling enzyme which, when
delivered recombinantly via a probiotic that does not endogenously express SagA, can potentiate the anti-
tumor effects of PD-1 checkpoint therapy in murine tumor model studies. The peptidoglycan metabolites
generated by SagA directly engage host PRRs activating key host immune signaling pathways [19].
While defined microbiome commensal strains may offer an interesting alternative to prevent and treat cancer in
combination with ICI therapy, many strains are not suitable for human use (including certain SagA positive
Enterococci), and the mechanism of action is difficult to characterize making drug development challenging.
However, recent studies suggest that improved probiotics engineered to carry specific recombinant biological
targeting agents to the gut can be an effective approach to target intestinal microbiome pathways. Indeed, our
recent results demonstrate that engineering or ‘reprogramming’ of probiotics to recombinantly express and
deliver SagA to the intestinal tract can impact immune responsiveness of cancer and greatly enhances the
effects of ICI therapy. These anti-tumor effects occur via intestinal PRR engagement. Our goal is to develop a
novel probiotic strain to deliver SagA (referred to as R-5780) as an orally administered drug that synergizes
with ICI agents to enhance effectiveness of immunotherapy. The key objectives of are to: 1) finalize R-5780
validation by determining activity in a second tumor model, and demonstrating preliminary manufacturability, 2)
perform necessary scale up process development to prepare for GMP manufacturing, 3) assess R-5780
activity in dose escalation studies and identify novel biomarkers that could be use in clinical trials, and 4)
complete an IND-enabling GLP pharm tox study.
Successful commercialization of R-5780 will profoundly advance immunotherapy treatment of cancer.Project Narrative
The microbiota of cancer patients is correlated with their response to immunotherapy drugs, but the mechanisms
of specific commensal bacteria strains have not been elucidated and limit their translation into new therapeutics [7-
14]. We recently discovered that beneficial Enterococci strains express a unique enzyme, Secreted Antigen A
(SagA), which generates peptidoglycan fragments to engage immune anti-tumor mechanisms. These exciting
findings reveal fundamental microbiota mechanisms in cancer immunotherapy and afford a new opportunity to
engineer a novel recombinant probiotic drug to delivery SagA, R-5780, to improve cancer immunotherapy.",  ,,,,GARY  FANGER,,(443) 248-2796,gfanger@risetherapeutics.com,,  ,

By promoting the use of bamboo in construction industry via offering a sustainable alternative to 3D printed concrete, this project intends to reduce industry's contribution towards future carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Current trends show that 3D printing could replace a large share of construction industry due to high efficiency, low labor, and reduced material requirements. This project would speed that transition with its sustainable alternative to concrete. Since bamboo can absorb as much as 12 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare per year, compared to 6.4 tons for a mature forest, broader use of bamboo in the construction industry benefits the environment. This SBIR Phase I project is focused on creating a structural bamboo filament that could replace 3D printer filaments made of concrete. This project will use bamboo for a rival filament to concrete to be used in structural applications. Non-structural wood filaments already exist and are mixed with Polylactic-Acid (PLA). This project plans to incorporate some of those techniques in its design by breaking the bamboo into rectangular, dust-like particles for combination with a soy-based adhesive and PLA. The most challenging problems anticipated in this project are optimizing that glue ratio to maximize spread properties and ultimate strength, and orienting the anisotropic bamboo particles during the deposition.

With the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic situation and the recent emergence of the coronavirus variants, one common concern is that the virus variants are more contagious than their predecessors, and will likely spread quickly within communities without early detection and warning. Other concerns are that future mutations may not be covered by existing vaccines, in which case early monitoring through high resolution wastewater-based epidemiology will become one of the only effective means of providing early alerts of the presence of such mutated virus variants within local communities. With a wide adaptation of the proposed instrumentation by municipalities, large and small communities such as college campuses and senior care facilities, the project enables the early detection and monitoring of the current coronavirus and its variants during the pandemic. The technology can also be extended to other emerging viruses with risks of community spread in the years to follow, not only in wastewater but also in widespread environmental and recreational water quality monitoring. The proposed project is a highly-optimized reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) approach for in-situ sampling and analysis, and the realization of a corresponding instrumentation platform that is applicable to the early detection and monitoring of different viruses, including the current coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), its variants, and other emerging viruses. The proposed technology aims to reduce the time-to-result compared to current wastewater-based epidemiology approaches while minimizing cost and logistics. The effort will include the testing of several protocols that are amendable to adaption for automated in-situ SARS-CoV-2 measurement, followed by the selection and optimization of the most suitable one. The protocols will be subsequently tested and validated using spiked samples, along with appropriate positive and negative controls. The approach will implement, for the first time in an automated device, the latest advances in molecular biology protocols, such as extraction-free single-step RT-qPCR. The project strives to achieve the first in-situ RT-qPCR available, with the potential to completely revolutionize the fields of wastewater-based epidemiology, general environmental testing and source tracking.

Combining cutting-edge nanotechnology, concentrating solar power, and innovative and compact design, the technology can convert any saline water or wastewater to potable quality fresh water using sunlight as the only energy source. The research will evaluate a novel reactor design that allows the thermal energy converted from sunlight to be recovered and reused multiple times for desalination and purification of saline water, all in one compact, low cost device. If successful, this technology could provide a low-cost, energy-efficient, and environmentally sustainable solution to a wide range of water challenges: providing reliable and affordable drinking water for communities that lack access to fresh water or reliable power supplies; supplying clean water at off-grid industrial production sites; recovering clean water from municipal and industrial wastewaters; minimizing discharge of contaminants-laden waste streams to the environment. This SBIR Phase I project aims to develop a high efficiency, low cost desalination technology directly powered by sunlight. The research pursues two innovations that greatly enhance the performance of a novel desalination process: nanophotonics enhanced solar membrane distillation (NESMD). First, a novel membrane module design (patent pending) could achieve multi-effect solarthermal membrane distillation in a compact, low-cost module; second, coupling the multi-effect module design with a low-cost solar concentrator would deliver high intensity solar irradiation necessary to drive a multi-effect process while maintaining high membrane flux. The goal is to increase in the gained output ratio (GOR) by a factor of 5. The high GOR value will reduce the specific energy consumption for desalination, and enhance water production rate per irradiated area. Proposed research includes (1) constructing a multi-effect NESMD module that demonstrates multi-stage heat recovery, (2) modeling the nonlinear, and coupled heat, momentum, and mass transfer in the module, (3) determining the effect of solar concentration, and (4) determining the effect of operating conditions and feed water quality. Model simulations will guide design, prototype testing, and optimization, while experimental research results will be used to improve the process model.

This proposal aims to address this critical clinical issue. We advance that asophisticated automated online referral system would resolve all of these problems, but there is noexpert-trained system for psychiatric referrals. We propose to automate the referral process,designed for college-age youth, by bridging online, mental health assessments and curated,up-to-date, mental health provider networks. To this end, the non-profit Child Mind1nstitute is partnering with the for-profit MiResource. Assessment expertise is providedby the Child Mind Institute, which treats children and adolescents with mental healthdisorders, conducts mental health research, has acquired large assessment datasets, has in-houseexpertise in mental health assessment, and through its MATTER lab has developed novel assessmenttechnologies such as the Mindlogger data collection and assessment platform.

water problems. This leads to at least 16 million cases of acute gastroenteritis directly linked to pollution at
community water systems, with tens of millions more directly impacted by chemical and organic pollutants.
Impacts are further exacerbated in locations dealing with water scarcity, in under-served populations, and
within other vulnerable populations already suffering from health disparities. Many of these water problems are
the direct result of managerial negligence, inconsistent monitoring, and a lack of the ability to anticipate where
problems may arise next. While the reasons for drinking water problems are complex, if we could anticipate
where health-based drinking water problems were to occur in the future, it could have an immediate
and positive impact on tens of millions of Americans annually. Interestingly, extensive data about water
quality and the performance of municipal water systems already exists in large, disparate databases. These
databases are largely ignored and, when used, are typically used only anecdotally and retroactively.
Preliminary evidence suggests that these existing databases, which contain histories of administrative
violations and sub-threshold water-quality results, can be mined to accurately predict future drinking water
crises. The Superior Statistical Research Randamp;D team is an internationally recognized group of water experts
with cross-cutting expertise in statistics/data analysis/modelling/computing, water-quality monitoring of
biological and chemical contaminants, and the ability to clearly and compellingly translate water-quality and
health information to actionable steps for individuals, organizations and communities. In this Phase I project,
we will show that it is possible to predict water-related, health-based problem areas utilizing already collected,
historical data on water quality and municipal water system performance. We will begin by harmonizing the
disparate water quality and municipal water system performance in two different states (Michigan and Iowa).
We will then utilize machine-learning techniques to predict health-based violation histories and will evaluate our
methods by comparing predicted violations to actual health-based violations in the previous 5 years. Finally,
we will identify at least 10 municipalities determined by our algorithm to be at the highest risk for future health-
based water problems and will do systematic sampling to confirm our model-based predictions. We will then
demonstrate how making these predictions can be leveraged to profitability by exploring how our model-based
predictions can be presented to customers in an economical, usable form. Proof of our concept and profitability
models in two states (Phase I) will set us up for widespread (multi-state) database harmonization and
improvement of the proposed machine-learning/modelling effort in Phase II. With multi-state harmonized
datasets, identification of key data gaps in particular states/areas, and proven financial models, our technology
will ultimately lead to dramatic reductions in the number of health-based drinking water problems annually.Project Narrative
Up to 45 million people per year in the U.S. are directly impacted by health-based drinking water problems, but
predicting where and when these health-based drinking water problems will occur remains a large and
complex obstacle. Current approaches focus on a reactive approach to health-based water-quality violations in
community water systems, rather than a proactive one that seeks to anticipate where problems will occur in the
future. The overall goal of this project is to leverage large and disparate historical datasets of water quality to
accurately predict locations of future health-based water-quality violations, validate the predictions, and
commercialize our proprietary predictions as a practical and cost-saving approach to anticipating and heading
off future health-based water problems.",  ,,,,NATHAN L TINTLE,,(712) 722-6264,nathan.tintle@dordt.edu,,  ,

Abstract
Each year, 20 million patients are diagnosed with infections leading to over 100,000 deaths and costing the US
healthcare system about $70B. Antibiotic resistant infections are increasingly common, causing about 3 million
infections and 35,000 deaths annually in the US. Patients, even those with life-threatening infections, can be
quickly cured if, near the onset of infection, they can be treated with an antibiotic that specifically targets the
pathogen causing the infection. Unfortunately, today’s diagnostic methods require 2-4 days to determine tar-
geted, or definitive, therapies. For this reason, physicians must treat patients empirically using broad-spectrum
antibiotics that are often less effective than definitive treatments and sometimes even completely ineffective.
Furthermore, treatment with these powerful drugs causes the spread of antibiotic resistance. This is exacerbated
by the fact that at least 30% of antibiotics are prescribed unnecessarily to patients that are in fact uninfected.
Current antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods for determining the definitive therapies take days to deliver
results because they require multiple lengthy steps including a day-long step to purify the pathogen cells in large
numbers by microbiological culture. This proposal develops novel products that detect whether patients are in-
fected, identify the pathogen in 30 minutes, and determine the definitive treatment in just a few hours rather
than the days required today. The proposed tests thus have the potential to dramatically improve patient out-
comes and attenuate the spread of resistance. The new tests identify (ID) pathogens and perform antimicrobial
susceptibility testing (AST) directly from patient specimens, eliminating the lengthy culture steps required by the
current methods. The novel MultiPath technology underlying the tests uses inexpensive digital imaging to rapidly,
sensitively, and affordably count individual microscopic bacterial cells without magnification. The MultiPath AST
tests can determine the definitive treatment for a much broader range of infections than other emerging rapid
susceptibility methods because they can determine antimicrobial susceptibility for specimens with commensal
bacteria and from patients with polymicrobial infections. The easy-to-use tests run on the automated random-
access MultiPath analyzer that is currently under regulatory review. This Phase II proposal develops rapid ID and
AST tests for urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs account for about half of all infections which are increasingly
caused by resistant pathogens. The proposed work builds on work presented in the preliminary results demon-
strating the feasibility of AST directly from urine specimens. Specifically, we will (1) Complete UTI ID/AST product
development; (2) Complete alpha UTI/AST analytical and preclinical studies; and (3) Complete external beta pre-
clinical studies and prepare for regulatory submission. Completion of the proposed project will deliver MultiPath
UTI ID/AST tests ready for verification and validation studies for regulatory submission in Phase III.",  ,,,,LAWRENCE  BURG,,(781) 271-0122,larry@firstlightdx.com,,  ,

Antibiotic-resistant Clostridioides difficile is responsible for more than 29,000 deaths in the US each year and
the infection is an urgent threat (as designated by CDC) to public health. The incidence of C. difficile infection
(CDI) and disease severity is increasing in recent years due to the emergence of hypervirulent and antibiotic-
resistant strains. CDI is caused by the exotoxins TcdA and TcdB secreted by C. difficile in the colon of the
host. Current standard treatment with antibiotics is not optimal and is accompanied by a high recurrence rate
due to the disruption of host colonization resistance. Moreover, there is no approved prevention against the
infection. Our goal is to develop a novel yeast-based immunoprophylactic/therapeutic against both primary and
recurrent CDI. We have developed a therapeutic lead by engineering a probiotic yeast, Saccharomyces
boulardii (Sb), to secrete an antitoxin ABAB (Sb-ABAB). ABAB is a fusion protein of 4 VHHs targeting 2 distinct
neutralizing epitopes in TcdA and 2 in TcdB respectively. ABAB is ultrapotent in neutralizing both TcdA and
TcdB and broadly active against toxins from 64 clinical isolates. Our preliminary data showed that oral Sb-
ABAB protected mice from both primary and recurrent CDI. The objectives of this Fast-track SBIR are to: 1)
phenotypically and genetically characterize Sb-ABAB to ensure its identity and quality; 2) determine
pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of Sb-ABAB; 3) develop clinic-compatible formula of Sb-ABAB capsules;
and 4) perform IND-enabling efficacy study in a piglet model of CDI. All proposed activities will be guided by an
exceptional advisory/consultant team with specialized expertise in business development, biologics regulation,
product development and planning, and clinical development. Upon the completion of the proposed studies, we
will pursue Phase IIb for GMP manufacturing of Sb-ABAB, GLP toxicology and IND submission in the future.",  ,,,,ZHIYONG  YANG,,(443) 543-5547,zhiyong_yang@fzata.com,,  ,

We have developed genetically modified second-generation probiotics for the localized delivery of known
mitigators to the GI tract in order to reduce damage and regenerate tissue after exposure to ionizing radiation.
Mitigating the effects of ionizing radiation exposure is critical for improving survival in the event of a radiological
or nuclear (RAD-NUC) incident, where exposure could lead to hematopoietic or gastrointestinal (GI) acute
radiation syndrome (ARS). While Neupogen and Neulasta have been granted label extensions by the FDA to
treat casualties of a RAD-NUC incident, these drugs do not prevent GI-ARS-related mortality. There currently
are no FDA-approved mitigators for GI-ARS. To address this critical need, we have engineered Lactobacillus
reuteri to produce therapeutic cytokines (IL-22 or INF-β) and target these mitigators to the small intestines to
recover intestinal stem cells, regenerate the radiation-sensitive intestinal crypts, and dramatically improve
survival from 0–10% to 70–80% after exposure to GI-ARS-inducing radiation doses. This is a new strategy for
therapeutic drug delivery, using a probiotic can be administered orally, facilitating its use in the context
of a resource-limited mass casualty scenario. In addition to mitigating injury following a RAD-NUC incident,
this approach is also applicable to radioprotection of the intestine during abdominal radiotherapy. Symptoms of
GI toxicity affect 60–80% of the andgt;300,000 patients that receive pelvic or abdominal radiation therapy per
year. This project is based on an entirely new concept that addresses the fundamental major limitations
associated with delivery of any potential radiation mitigator of GI syndrome, including (i) non-invasive
administration, (ii) targeted delivery of the therapeutic, (iii) maintained bioavailability of the therapeutic
at efficacious dose, (iv) trivially scalable to produce, and (v) no need for formulation. The goal of this
project is to develop an FDA-approved mitigator for radiation-induced GI injury. We propose critical studies to
characterize the maximum effective dose, establish the rate of clearance from the body, and address safety by
examining the effect of the drugs on the intestinal microbiome. In parallel, we will meet with the FDA to develop
a strategy for IND approval that will guide subsequent studies. Successful completion of this work will place
these probiotic drugs on a strong path towards eventual FDA approval.Project Narrative
Mitigating normal tissue toxicity after exposure to ionizing radiation is critical to reduce mortality and morbidity,
both for patients that receive pelvic or abdominal radiation therapy, and in the context of a RAD-NUC incident.
We have developed second-generation probiotics engineered to express the therapeutic cytokines IL-22 or
INF-β that have been shown to increase survival from 0–10% to 70–80%. The goal of this project is to continue
to optimize and characterize these probiotic drugs for pivotal IND-enabling pre-clinical studies, which, if
successful, will lead to the only FDA-approved radiation mitigators for GI toxicity.",  ,,,,CLAUDE J ROGERS,,(626) 381-9974,jaxtelle@chromologic.com,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH,  ,

Leading to over 270,000 deaths in the US annually, septicemia is the systemic inflammatory response to a
bloodstream infection (BSI). Early diagnosis and treatment of BSIs have demonstrated improved patient
outcomes and reduced hospitalization time. However, currently accepted diagnostic approaches have not
advanced substantially since the advent of automated blood culturing systems. As such, today’s gold-standard,
is not only slow, requiring ~1-3 days, but also demonstrates reduced sensitivity in the presence of antimicrobial
treatment. It is therefore critical to advance new diagnostic approaches, which do not rely on culturing.
To address this unmet need, HelixBind developed RaPID/BSI, a fully automated sample-to-answer test which
identifies and characterizes BSIs directly from blood in ~3 hours, without cultures. Implemented on the RaPID
(Resistance and Pathogen IDentification) platform and appropriate for placement throughout the hospital,
RaPID/BSI incorporates a broad test menu of 21 bacterial and fungal pathogens and is not compromised by prior
antimicrobial treatment. Species level detail is provided with single CFUs/ml sensitivity, enabling selection of
appropriate antimicrobials. Commercialization of RaPID/BSI would provide timely characterization of BSIs and
enable intervention with targeted antimicrobial treatment. This would result in improved patient outcomes and
a reduction in the use of unnecessary antimicrobials, slowing the rise of antimicrobial resistance. Reflecting
RaPID/BSI’s significant advantages over exiting alternatives and the potential to improve care and quality of
life, the FDA designated RaPID/BSI a Breakthrough Technology in 2020.
HelixBind has met and exceeded all of the Specific Aims defined in the Phase II SBIR. This included assay
optimization, automation onto a single-use plastic disposable operated by a benchtop instrument, and testing of
clinical specimens. Clinical results demonstrating rt94% sensitivity and 99.8% specificity across the assay far
surpassed our milestone of 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity. In addition, based on feedback from potential
customers, the test menu was expanded from 16 to 21 pathogens and the capability to detect resistance
mechanisms was demonstrated.
Given the success of Phase II, HelixBind proposes in Phase IIB to advance RaPID/BSI toward readiness for
regulatory clearance. Specific Aims, each with quantifiable deliverables, serve to address feedback form FDA
received during a Pre-Submission meeting and to de-risk manufacturing and usability aspects of the product.
This proposed Phase IIB will culminate in a blinded, multi-site in-hospital study, challenging our proposed FDA
pivotal study design. Upon completion of this project, we will be well placed to initiate formal Analytical and
Clinical studies for FDA clearance of RaPID/BSI and scale manufacturing for product launch.",  ,,,,ALON  SINGER,,(508) 460-1028,asinger@helixbind.com,,  ,

faster and higher resolution high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) separations of larger
molecules including proteins, peptides, glycopeptides, and glycans. Proteins therapeutics are complex
molecules, susceptible to intended or unintended alterations of composition and conformation. Many
therapeutic proteins are inherently a mixture of closely related variants. Current practice is to employ
HPLC to resolve and quantify the components such protein mixtures, to assure identity and safety of
the protein drug. Many HPLC separations of proteins are limited in resolution of protein mixtures,
require an hour or more, and may not completely resolve all of the components. Due to the complexity
of samples, there are many examples in the current research literature that combine multiple HPLC
analyses to gain full details on protein composition, and to measure the levels of protein variants, both
during development of the drug, as well as manufacture and quality assurance/quality control.
Regardless of the intended use of the quantitative information, high efficiency LC separations are a
fundamental part of the analytical systems, and the time to achieve high resolution separations of
protein samples is a great bottleneck. This proposal describes an approach to improve the separation
efficiency of HPLC for protein analysis by extending the use of novel superficially porous particle
(SPP) technologies with optimized characteristics, providing significantly faster and higher resolution
separations of proteins in the native state. Our objectives are to create SPP silica particles,
specifically design for use in conditions that maintain intact native structures, optimize the materials
properties, and to load these materials efficiently into HPLC column formats. The proposed work will
extend recent breakthroughs in material science that yield authentic improvements in current
materials, seeking to employ the technology in additional native modes of HPLC operation, including
hydrophobic interaction and ion exchange. The goals of the proposed work would yield very high
performance chromatographic products, greater than those currently available, to be applied broadly
in analysis of proteins, particularly for protein therapeutics. The application of the technology is not
limited to biopharmaceutical preparations, and, in fact, would benefit any current application that uses
HPLC methods for larger biological molecule analyses. The separations technology described will
directly lead to useful products for which there is a significant technical and market demand.NarrativeHigh pressure liquid chromatography is the most widely used analytical method to separate
mixtures of molecules, allowing measurement of quantities and identities of materials in a sample.
This method is broadly used in biomedical research, as well as in the creation, manufacture and
control of therapeutic interventions. The current proposal is to use new knowledge in materials
science and chemistry to enable faster and more efficient separations by liquid chromatography,

PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a problem of national concern. Medication-based treatment (MT) reduces opioid
use, associated risk behaviors and death. Despite evidence supporting MT with buprenorphine, in more than ½
of US counties (mainly rural), there are no prescribers. Patients travel long distances, join waitlists, or go
without MT. Other barriers to care include lack of transportation, competing demands (work, childcare) and
stigma. Combined, lack of access and barriers leaves millions without treatment. Our innovative solution
(Boulder) is a telehealth-based treatment solution offering long-term support for OUD. Our vision is to deploy
care teams (Prescribing Clinician, Nurse Coach, Care Advocate and Certified Peer Coach for each patient) to
deliver a comprehensive array of services, supervised by addiction specialists with decades of experience.
Technology enables us to effectively scale a program that meets all of NIDA's guidelines for appropriate
oversight, and provides low-barrier, patient-centered interventions (e.g. video medication monitoring and
private (at home) random observed saliva drug testing. The long-term goal of this proposal is to build a
scalable solution able to reach patients who are unable to access evidence-based treatment. Our digital
program promises to dramatically improve the patient experience, boosting patient retention, satisfaction,
medication adherence, and functional outcomes by providing low barrier, quality care. The patient-facing
product is developed. In preliminary testing, patients reported high satisfaction, engagement, and usability, and
access to care was increased by 38% in three months. The overall objective is to evaluate the ability of a
virtual platform to create the necessary paradigmatic shift in OUD treatment. To achieve this objective, we
propose the following aims: Phase I, Aim I: Advance Boulder's mobile platform development and obtain
patient feedback; Phase II, Aim II: Determine Boulder's impact on patient engagement, program retention,
access to care, and care continuity; and Phase II, Aim III: Determine Boulder's impact on opioid use and
patient functional status. Purchasers of our product (e.g. private/commercial/governmental payors, at-risk
provider groups, etc.) who provide remuneration on a per-patient, per-month basis, realizing substantial cost
savings through our integrated services. Unlike typical fee-for-service care delivery, our economic model aligns
incentives around delivering superior patient outcomes. The virtual OUD treatment product's end-users are
resource-constrained patients who will access care no cost to them. Technology enables our team of medical,
behavioral, and social service providers to bring comprehensive telehealth-based care for the longitudinal
management of addictive disease directly to the patient, rather than bringing the patient to the care. The
research team includes staff and affiliates of Boulder, the Addiction Research and Education Foundation and
community partners. Boulder's current investors provide a wide range of support services to ensure success
through a national network of experienced entrepreneurs and leaders that provide mentorship and guidance.",  ,,,,STEPHANIE  PAPES,,(704) 604-8343,stephanie@boulder.care,,  ,

Pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers, more commonly known as bedsores are a huge problem
affecting 2.5 million patients every year in the US and causes 60,000 deaths every year.
Pressures exceeding 32 mm of Hg in the bony prominences in the back of the patient body lead
to bedsores. Despite the existing low air loss mattresses, alternating pressure mattresses and the
state-of-the-art air fluidized beds, bedsores prevail, and its prevention remains a huge healthcare
challenge. Current hospital protocol is to turn patient every two hours. This is very disturbing and
cause of pain to a resting patient who is dealing with other co-existing health conditions besides
bedsores. Caregivers and nurses must turn heavy patients around, which sometimes lead to
hurting their backs in the process. When not performed adequately and frequently (every 2 hours)
as required, it is considered as negligence of care and causes litigation against nursing homes
and hospitals causing huge financial losses to them. We propose a compliant-mechanism-
based mattress that will obsolete the current clinical protocol of nurses and caregivers
having to turn the patient every two hours. It will operate with minimal power, make small
clicking noise when changing from one stable state to another using amount of force required to
open a desk drawer. This switching of states can be further automated and can include a simple
counter for documented evidence of alternating pressure to support against litigation of negligent
care. In specific aim 1, machine learning using trained neural network will determine the functional
requirements of the mattress (e.g., optimal amplitude and pitch for the undulation of the pressure
points) by conducting a cohort pressure profile study that involves a bed that intentionally applies
pressure on resting bodies. In specific aim 2, ideal topology with pitch and amplitude of
undulations discovered in aim 1 will be developed using FACT and optimized using BLOT to
create a prototype bi-stable compliant-mechanism-based mattress as a new approach for shifting
pressure points on a patient’s body. FACT is advanced technique using freedom and
constraint topologies for topology synthesis of the mattress and BLOT provides boundary
layer optimization of the topology. Proposed mattress is innovative, disruptive, affordable,
lightweight, does not use noisy air pumps, has no leakage issues and will eliminate the
scourge of bedsores in the existing immobile and aging population.Project Narrative
Numerous currently marketed alternating pressure mattresses have not received recommendations from
reviewers due to poor correlation and unconvincing outcomes for bedsore prevention. Our approach of
using neural network based machine learning will bring a new methodical approach to discerning the pitch
and amplitude of undulations required to prevent dead pressure zones that exceed safe pressure of 32
mm of Hg on the patient’s back, which is fundamental to preventing bedsores. This will further serve as
input to designing the prototype compliant-mechanism-based mattress using the freedom and constraint
topologies (FACT) approach and the boundary learning optimization tool (BLOT) with end effect of
developing an innovative mattress for preventing bedsores in the immobile and aging population.",  ,,,,JONATHAN  HOPKINS,,(310) 825-8091,hopkins@seas.ucla.edu,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES",  ,

SO2 is an air pollutant, which can adversely affect respiratory and cardiovascular health in humans. Onsite monitoring of SO2 would enable real-time detection of chronic and acute exposure to this toxic gas and lead to the mitigation of health problems. Currently, large stationary expensive UV-fluorescence analyzer equipment can be used to monitor SO2 levels in the ppb range, but this makes it difficult to monitor levels of SO2 at many different locations. Therefore, there is a need for a portable and inexpensive SO2 detector to expand the areas where monitoring is possible. This would assist in limiting exposure to this toxic gas. Electrochemical SO2 detectors meet some of these requirements but have poor sensitivity and insufficient detection concentration ranges to meet EPA standards for monitoring SO2.NanoAffix has expertise related to developing graphene-based sensors for monitoring water and air quality. The sensors for SO2 detection utilize graphene coated with mixed metal oxide nanoparticles which are being optimized for sensitivity and selectivity toward measuring SO2 onsite. This innovation combines the excellent electronic properties of graphene with the selectivity of novel mixed oxide nanoparticles for SO2 detection. These sensors function as chemiresistors and are capable of portable and inexpensive detection of SO2 in the necessary single digit ppb concentration range under ambient conditions. In phase I, NanoAffix demonstrated sensitivity down to 2 ppb SO2 under ambient temperature and pressure with these graphene-based sensors. NanoAffix successfully created a calibration curve in the range of 2 ppb to 40 ppb SO2 for detecting unknown concentrations of SO2. The gas sensor market size is estimated to be $4.7 billion by 2025 according to ‘Global Gas Sensors, Detectors, and Analyzers Market Report 2019-2025’ by Frost and Sullivan.

The device safety and efficacy will be tested for residual hearing preservation in cochlear implant surgeries by comparing pre- and post-operative hearing outcomes and intra-operative electrophysiological measurements. Extensive preclinical research was enabled by a NIDCD R21 and industry support that allowed development of a protocol for hypothermia delivery using a device and probe suitable for a rodent model. We propose here to re-engineer the device and probe for clinical implantation in the operating room, and prepare it for regulatory approval. We will also carry out first-in- patient studies for the therapy by implementing localized, therapeutic hypothermia for protection of hair cells and neural substrate during cochlear implantation. This approach brings a non-pharmaceutical therapy for residual hearing preservation to the market. Furthermore, hypothermia localized to the inner ear avoids challenges with systemic cooling or with delivery of drugs to the inner ear. The device and probe do not require alteration of the surgical approach or the implant electrode. The specific aims are motivated by our preclinical studies that have shown that hypothermia can preserve residual hearing long-term post-cochlear implantation. Ensuring the survival of sensitive hair cells and neural structures in the cochlea will lead to improved residual hearing preservation, which in the long-term can improve speech perception outcomes.",  ,,,,CURTIS S KING,,4064146278,cking@restorear.com,,  ,

Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPi’s) have emerged as important new therapeutic agents
targeting a broadening class of gene mutations present in breast, ovarian, prostate and a host of other cancers.
These drugs have been targeted to patients and/or tumors with BRCA-related gene mutations, but not all patients
whose tumors have these mutations respond to PARPi. Equally important, this approach misses patients who
may benefit from PARPi since tumors without BRCA-related genes may respond. Trevarx Biomedical Inc.’s
(Trevarx) first licensed product, [18F]fluorthanatrace ([18F]FTT), is a PET-labeled analog of the PARPi rucaparib,
and provides quantitative images of regional PARP expression. Early clinical trial data in ovarian and breast
cancer carried out at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), Washington University in St. Louis (WU) and MD
Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) support the accuracy of [18F]FTT tumor uptake as an in-vivo measure of
regional PARP1 drug binding and indicate its potential as a more effective PARPi imaging predictive biomarker.
[18F]FTT has an established body of published academic research and a 2-3 year lead over other competitive
PET PARPi imaging agents that have only recently completed first-in-human studies.
Trevarx has the goal of making [18F]FTT widely available for clinical use as a companion diagnostic for PARPi
therapy. Partnering with MDACC, Penn, and WU, Trevarx is developing a Phase 2 multi-center clinical trial in
breast cancer that will lead to a subsequent Phase 3 trial to support an [18F]FTT NDA. To support this goal,
Trevarx must develop the validated GMP synthesis and testing for [18F]FTT that is required to support eventual
commercial production for Phase 3 trials and NDA submission. This Phase 1 STTR proposal by Trevarx and
Penn will determine the best method for synthesizing [18F]FTT for widespread distribution by maximizing product
consistency and production yield with the following aims: (1) Evaluate the synthesis yield and production
robustness of [18F]FTT using two common GMP-compliant chemistry modules via two different synthesis routes;
and (2) test the feasibility of simplifying [18F]FTT purification using solid-phase extraction methods. Completion
of these aims will result in an optimized synthesis platform that will lead to a Phase 2 STTR effort to roll out a
training and compliance program to sites that will participate in Phase 2 clinical trials and develop [18F]FTT for
production with a commercial PET radiopharmaceutical supply partner to assure broadly available tracer supply
for Phase 3 multi-center trials and prompt clinical rollout after drug approval.RELEVANCE:
To further the development and commercialization of [18F]fluorthanatrace ([18F]FTT), a PET tracer of PARP1
expression and drug binding, Trevarx Biomedical Inc. and University of Pennsylvania is proposing a Phase 1
STTR grant to determine the best method for synthesizing [18F]FTT for widespread distribution and maximizing
product consistency and production yield. The proposed effort will result in an optimized synthesis that will
support a broadly available tracer supply for Phase 3 multi-center trials and prompt clinical rollout after drug
approval, enabling better guidance of PARPi treatment for many cancer patients.",  ,,,,SALLY  SCHWARZ,,(314) 495-9862,schwarzs@wustl.edu,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,  ,

Proteasomal degradation of
target proteins is a well-established means whereby the Ub proteasome system (UPS) controls protein content.
Enzymes called Ub E3 ligases conjugate Ub to target proteins by forming an isopeptide bond between the ε-
amino group of the target protein lysine and the carboxylate of the C-terminal glycine of Ub. Conjugation of
multiple Ubs forms poly-Ub chains at any of its seven lysines (K), and K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63
Ub chains having various roles are present in all tissues. Recently, several groups designed small molecules
that bind to an E3 ligase at one end and a target protein at the other, physically facilitating ubiquitylation of the
target protein, which is then degraded. This hijacking of a ligase to ubiquitylate a desired protein has launched
a new class of drug called PROTACs (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras). PROTAC-based approaches for
therapeutics offer several advantages: 1) selective, catalytic degradation of the target; 2) conversion of weak
binders into selective PROTAC drugs; 3) degradation of overexpressed or mutant targets; and 4) maximal
degradation from limited target engagement. To date, cereblon and VHL ligase binders have been most
commonly used as vehicles to ubiquitylate target proteins such as nuclear receptors, kinases, transcription
factors, and neuronal proteins tau and α-synuclein. A major problem has hindered development of new PROTAC
drugs, however. Chemical optimization of PROTAC molecules depends on rapid evaluation of synthesized
compounds to guide the synthetic strategy for producing drug candidate molecules. Assays currently available
are labor intensive and do not provide results to the medicinal chemists fast enough – often, a week is required.
In Phase I, a facile in vitro method employing Ub ligases cereblon and HDM2 was developed to screen for
potential PROTAC drugs; PROTAC-mediated ubiquitylation of selected proteins was recapitulated in vitro in a
way that mimics observed PROTAC-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of these proteins in vivo,
achieving the aims of Phase I. In phase II, the utility of this method will be expanded to include representative
members of all Ub ligase families (cullin families, RING finger ligases, Hect family ligases, and SUMO ligase),
increasing the biochemical and chemical space for PROTAC drug discovery. To scale up PROTAC screens, a
microtiter plate-based, high throughput method will be established to monitor in vitro PROTAC drug discovery,
and biochemical and Ub mass spec proteomics will be employed to demonstrate that target protein lysines
ubiquitylated in vitro are correlated with in vivo PROTAC mediated degradation of target proteins.
Commercialization of the microtiter plate based PROTAC system will have a major impact on academic research
as well as PROTAC drug discovery.",  ,,,,KARTEEK  KADIMISETTY,,(610) 644-8845,kadimisetty@lifesensors.com,,  ,

(CLE) affect millions of Americans with limited therapeutic options currently available, creating a significant need
for novel therapeutic options. A hallmark of CLE is the presence of autoantibodies against nucleic acids and
nucleic acid-binding proteins, as well as elevated interferons (IFNs). In CLE it remains unclear which
mechanisms are most critical in precipitating disease; however, CLE lesions histologically present as an interface
dermatitis, which is orchestrated by type-I and type III interferons and interferon-regulated chemokines largely
produced by basal keratinocytes in the lower epidermis. Importantly, a break-through discovery in our
laboratories has identified a novel kinase target for the inhibition of type-I and type-III IFN production called
RIOK3. RIOK3 is a member of the RIO protein kinase family (right open reading frame kinase) and preliminary
data from CRISPR knockout and siRNA knockdowns in mammalian cells demonstrates its prominent role in IFN
production. Following knockout studies, we tested two compounds that are able to bind RIOK3. They significantly
decreased Type I and III IFN mRNA and protein expression following keratinocyte exposure to polyriboinosinic-
polyribocytidylic acid (polyI:C or PIC), a TLR3 ligand that activates interferon pathways. Additionally, media
transfer experiments in keratinocytes confirm that RIOK3 inhibition not only reduces the IFN response in PIC
exposed cells but also disrupts the IFN feed-forward loop, as measured by IFN-regulated protein CXCL10, a key
driver of immune cell hyper-recruitment to the skin in CLE lesions. This preliminary work strongly supports our
central hypothesis that a topical RIOK3 inhibitor will dose-dependently decrease cutaneous IFNs and IFN-
regulated genes, resulting in the reduction of CLE lesions, with improved efficacy and patient tolerance compared
to systemic treatments. Importantly, unlike JAK inhibitors that have an ON/OFF effect on many cellular pathways,
a topical RIOK3 inhibitor could work selectively and dose-dependently to finely regulate IFN secretion and restore
IFN balance in the skin. Therefore, RIOK3 inhibitors hold immense potential as a novel class of next generation
kinase inhibitors. The research proposal has two principal aims: In SA1, we will complete the characterization of
a defined series of previously identified, but promiscuous, RIOK3 inhibitors on Type I and Type III IFNs in
keratinocytes. This will inform SAR-based selection and optimization of the most active chemical moieties. These
compounds will be designed for topical delivery and will be assessed for RIOK3 activity and selectivity. In SA2,
we will establish the efficacy of our top three candidates in stimulated reconstructed human epidermis. Top
candidates will pass skin toxicological studies and will undergo metabolism studies to ensure effective skin half-
life with low blood half-life. The overall goal of this collaborative effort between experts in medicinal chemistry,
immunology, and dermatology is to demonstrate the incredible potential of RIOK3 selective inhibitors as a first-
in-class, novel kinase inhibitor for treatment of adult and pediatric patients suffering from CLE.PROJECT NARRATIVE (Public Health Relevance)
Chronic auto-inflammatory skin diseases with a prominent interferon phenotype such as cutaneous lupus
erythematosus affect millions of people worldwide and do not have effective therapies at present. Our objective
in this proposal is to design a small molecule that can block the atypical protein kinase RIOK3, and thus, inhibit
Type I and Type III interferon production in the skin. This STTR Phase 1 will generate data necessary to validate
our proposed target, dermal RIOK3, for the treatment of cutaneous lupus erythematosus in adult and pediatric

In the traditional internet the number of available IPs and ports is rather small, making it easy to scan one's network and see potential vulnerabilities based on responses received. Instead of exposing network devices to everyone on the web 2.0, users will be able to put them behind the system proposed for development, which acts as an additional layer on top of the traditional TCP/IP concept. With the system listening only to the designated 32-byte long dynamically changing IPFS address the chances of guessing the right one is 1/2256, thus making it practically impossible to purposefully find the “entrance”. During the research and development process the project will work on the physical product realization, modify IPFS nodes, and design protocols responsible for decentralized VPN channels and media content delivery on the web 3.0, because solving latency issues will create new opportunities for the real-time communications on distributed networks. Another goal of this research effort is to mitigate the forthcoming threats imposed by the quantum computers, which will be achieved through the utilization of post-quantum encryption algorithms applicable to data transmitted through the traditional and decentralized mediums.

Western blotting is one of the most widely used bioanalytical techniques for the detection of proteins of interest
in an unknown mixture such as cell/tissue homogenate or extract. This technology was invented in the late
1970s and has enabled numerous discoveries in biology and medicine in the past 40 years. Although it is not
in the spotlight anymore, western blotting has been applied at least two times more often than other competing
or complementing techniques, such as mass spec, ELISA, and IHC within the last 10 years. Despite this
amazingly wide acceptance by the scientific community, western blotting, in general, is not a very sensitive
technique and is only semi-quantitative. The lack of quantitation in Western blot has raised major concerns in
the scientific community on data reproducibility. Building on two breakthroughs we made in recent years,
monovalent Qdot probes and optically clear transfer membranes, we propose to develop the next generation
Western blot kits with improved sensitivity, quantification ability, multiplexing capability and flexibility in readout
(standard gel UV imager or microscopy-based particle counting). If successful, we expect this technology to
quickly become a commercial product to power biology research for another 40 years.
.NARRATIVE
Invented 40 years ago, western blotting is one of the most frequently used analytical techniques in biology but
suffers from low sensitivity and quantification capability. These limitations are well-recognized by the scientific
community but without much effort to address them, because the technology development phase for western
blotting has long-passed. Although not in the spot light anymore, the need for a sensitive and quantitative
western blot remains strong in the era of quantitative biology. Here, we propose to develop such a kit that can
quickly become a commercial product by combining an optically clear transfer membrane and a bright
monovalent imaging probe.",  ,,,,HONGYAN  LIU,,(503) 956-5302,hongy.liu@yahoo.com,,  ,

Approximately 50% of the world’s population lives within 50 miles of the coast and migration toward coastal areas is increasing. The risks to these areas are reflected in the substantial increase in insurance and FEMA claims. This project will research and develop software systems that streamline the analysis, permitting, and implementation of nature-based coastal protection solutions that have been proven to adapt to these risks and provide environmental benefits. This project will develop cross-cutting technologies that will enhance our knowledge of coastal sciences and engineering and leverage nature-based approaches to coastal integrity issues, leading to increasing ecological, cost, and performance advantages compared to traditional manual methods of data collection, analysis and engineering. The empowerment of more resilient coastal communities, enhanced fisheries, and adaptive infrastructure solutions will incentivize private sector investment in these regions. This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop an integrated software system to prescribe intelligent coastal maintenance solutions through the automated characterization of the relationship of near-shore vegetative indicator species with shoreline protective actions. It is generally understood that shoreline stability is related to nearshore vegetative health, but the difficulty of analyzing and interpreting the complex data sets with certainty levels sufficient to prescribe specific maintenance actions necessitates the investigation and development of a new analytical framework. The principal technical objective is the development of a machine learning and bayesian inference decision support tool incorporating data from existing imagery databases, multispectral UAV imagery, RTK bathymetry, and shoreline maintenance actions for experimental validation. This approach would be applicable to a wide variety of vegetated erosional shoreline systems (i.e. wetlands, coastal dunes, and mangroves). The anticipated result is the technical foundation of a commercial system to more efficiently manage coastal infrastructure risk at lower costs and with enhanced ecological benefits for society.

The first target application is to enable widespread use of nanometer-sized particles (30-150 nm) to carry cell signaling information throughout the body. Particles designed to signal a particular cellular response are a major component of drug therapeutics as their size allows them to access parts of the body otherwise impossible to reach, such as the blood-brain barrier in the event of a stroke and tumor penetration for cancer patients.

Sonoval is expanding its successful biologic drug platform technology to develop second generation versions of
the cancer therapeutic Ontak, with the potential to advance the field of regulatory T cells (Tregs)-depleting
immunotherapy through a mechanism previously unique to Ontak alone. Sonova;’s therapeutics will target Tregs
for treatment of major solid tumors, which afflict rt50,000 Americans per year, by transiently and potently
depleting these CD25+ cells while being non-toxic to other cell types. Tregs contribute to cancer progression by
suppressing anti-tumor immune responses Thus far, one of the lead second generation candidates has
demonstrated 3-5-fold anti-tumor effect as monotherapy compared to no treatment, and in novel application,
enhances check-point inhibitor (CPI) activity by up to 5-fold in murine models of solid tumors.
For over a decade, Ontak was approved for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, making it the first antibody
fusion protein of non-monoclonal origin approved for use by the FDA. Ontak was also found to be effective in
the treatment of several solid tumors by transient Treg depletion in the tumor microenvironment. Despite its
clinical success Ontak suffered from two critical drawbacks: a 25% rate of vascular leak syndrome (VLS), and
significant manufacturing inconsistencies that included variable levels of protein aggregates (up to 40%) and
detergent contamination. These issues led to the drug being taken off the market in 2011.
Sonoval’s second generation versions of Ontak, SON-211 and SON-301, both show reduced VLS and are
potential lead drugs for development. Further, Sonoval holds IP on a novel production method that solves prior
manufacturing problems and enables product to be made with 0% aggregation and no detergent. In preliminary
experiments, compared to Ontak, SON-211 shows an improved safety profile; a lower dose response; and
equipotent anti-tumor efficacy in 3 murine tumor models (melanoma, colon carcinoma, renal cell cancer). in these
same models, SON-211 monotherapy is significantly potentiated by the addition of CPI, paving the path to novel
sequential combination treatment regimens. Further, SON-211 has been show to deplete CD39+ activated Treg
in the tumor microenvironment by 72%, and to increase levels of effector T cells in tumors, while not depleting
resting Tregs in spleen. The purpose of this Fast Track project is to finalize lead compound identification (Phase
I), and to meet safety, efficacy and manufacturing milestones (Phase II) needed to progress to IND approval.
Phase I’s single Aim will be to evaluate SON-211 and SON-301 based on their levels of superiority to Ontak in
safety (VLS testing), anti-tumor efficacy with and without CPI, and production efficiency of fermentation, at 5-liter
scale. Phase II Aims include: 1) Determine optimal dosing regimen as anti-cancer monotherapy and as dual
sequential immunotherapy with CPI; 2) Optimize production/purification; 3) Conduct pre-IND, pharmacokinetics
studies of lead drug in rats; 4) Tumor repetitive dosing studies to evaluate tumor eradication and/or time to
relapse in Murine tumor models.",  ,,,,PETER D SUZDAK,,(443) 756-8427,wbishai@gmail.com,,  ,

Airviz Inc. is developing an affordable and reliable particle monitor that may be more
relevant to adverse health outcomes by measuring both PM0.3 and PM2.5. While measurement of
PM2.5 (particles smaller than 2.5µm) is the recognized standard for fine particle air pollution, there
is a growing body of evidence to indicate that adverse health outcomes continue at levels less
than half the average daily safe values of 12 μg/m3 specified by the EPA. In 2005, Maynard and
Kuempel concluded that particle toxicity increases with decreasing particle diameter and
increasing total particle surface area, thus challenging mass-based risk evaluation approaches.
Lung Deposited Surface Area (LDSA), 99% of which is due to particles below 300 nm, has been
proposed as a better metric to relate PM exposures to adverse health outcomes. Attention has
also been paid to relating mass concentrations of ultrafine particles (PM0.1, particles lower than
0.1µm) as a better health metric. But further studies indicate that measuring only ultrafine
particles would exclude significant numbers of still very small particles and significant fractions
of mass and surface, while measuring the contributions of particles with diameters less than 300
nm would include most, if not all, of these particles. This background suggests that an improved
particulate monitor that measures the mass and surface concentrations of both PM2.5 and PM0.3
could provide the most relevant information on the effects of particulate matter on adverse health
problems and that such a monitor would include both ultrafine particles and LDSA. Most
inexpensive particle monitors currently available in the market use optical scattering techniques
to measure particle concentrations and are limited to particles larger than 350 nm. Monitors that
can detect particles smaller than 350 nm can become relatively expensive ($7000 to $16,000).
The sensor to be developed within this project is an optical sensor that utilizes multiple angles
and/or multiple wavelengths, scattering theory and advanced signal processing techniques to
infer particle size information. This technology can be used in residential, commercial, and
industrial applications or metropolitan environments to provide key insights into air quality and
how it can impact human health. Because the monitor will be easy to use and interpret,
compared to expensive reference instruments, information can be provided directly to the users
so that they can be driven to action. In particular, low-income communities that are often
impacted by poor air quality can more affordably determine real-time ambient conditions and
drive positive change by using the monitor to identify pollution sources, appropriate mitigation
measures, and then track the efficiency of these measures.Project Narrative
Recent literature suggests that particle toxicity increases with decreasing particle diameter and
increasing total particle surface area. Most inexpensive particle monitors are based upon light
scattering and tend to lose sensitivity for particles with diameters less than about 0.3-0.35 µm.
The novel particle monitor developed here addresses limitations in current inexpensive particle
monitors, to realize a monitor that may be more relevant to adverse health outcomes by
measuring both PM0.3 and PM2.5.",  ,,,,JILL  ANDERSEN,,(412) 651-8688,jill@airvizinc.com,,  ,

In contrast, existing solutions to MP identification and characterization are mostly laboratory based and involve laborious, time-consuming processes, expensive equipment and expertise to operate.During Phase I we have tested an initial prototype and verified its capabilities to a) identify MP in flow and distinguish them from other microobjects, b) characterize identified MP by color, shape, size, morphology and phase properties. We have also demonstrated feasibility of our techniques to perform MP compostion estimation by applying phase metrics and lens-free polarization imaging via an additional mode we will be adding in Phase II.

A major paradigm in cancer immunotherapy is to use checkpoint inhibitors to break regulatory mechanisms
that guard the host against autoimmune diseases. CTLA-4-targeting immunotherapy was the first example to
establish this paradigm. However, the clinically tested anti-CTLA-4 antibodies exhibit suboptimal efficacy but
high toxicity. Our preclinical study demonstrate that this outcome is predicated by inactivating the CTLA-4
checkpoint that plays important role in immune tolerance protecting body against autoimmune diseases.
Importantly, our studies have demonstrated that immunotherapy-related adverse events (irAE) and the cancer
immunotherapeutic effect (CITE) represent distinct and therapeutically separable activities of anti-CTLA-4
antibodies. The irAE is attributable to inactivation of CTLA-4 checkpoint, while the CITE is effective through
selective depletion of regulatory T cells (Treg) in tumor microenvironment.
We hypothesize that a safer and more effective CTLA-4-targeting immunotherapy should preserve rather
than inhibit the CTLA-4 checkpoint while enhancing the efficacy and selectivity of Treg-depletion in
tumor microenvironment.
In preparation to test this ground-breaking hypothesis clinically, we have generated a new generation of anti-
CTLA-4 antibodies that preserving CTLA-4 immune checkpoint by avoiding lysosomal degradation of CTLA-4.
The new antibody, ONC-392, has dramatically lower irAEs in humanized mouse model and significantly higher
potent activity in depleting tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells, resulting in more effective CITE. We have
conducted IND-enabling studies, including GMP-grade manufacturing and GLP toxicity in non-human primate.
We have also sought FDA feedback on our clinical plan through a pre-IND meeting. These progresses
allowed us to propose a Fast Track Phase 1/2 SBIR application to determine safety and efficacy of ONC-392 in
human cancer patients. With the support of the SBIR grant, we will carry out an open label Phase I/II clinical
study to test the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of ONC-392 as a single agent and in
combination with Pembrolizumab in advanced solid tumors and non-small cell lung cancer patients.
Our proposed study will not only confirm safety of ONC-392, but also provide clinical proof-of-concept data for
our new paradigm of CTLA-4 targeting cancer immunotherapy.",  ,,,,PAN  ZHENG,,(202) 751-6823,pzheng@oncoc4.com,,  ,

For a large percentage of the population, caffeine is known to have negative side effects, including anxiety, jitteriness, and insomnia. In the case of anxiety, an estimated 40 million Americans suffer from an anxiety disorder, which may be exacerbated by caffeine in coffee, energy drinks, and other beverages. Paraxanthine is an active ingredient that has stimulatory qualities similar to caffeine but is less likely to cause anxiety and jitteriness. Thus, paraxanthine can play a role in contributing to improved mental health. The proposed project aims to develop a cost-efficient, biological method to manufacture paraxanthine. Producing paraxanthine at low cost is currently a significant technical challenge. The compound is only found naturally in substantial quantities within the human body as the result of caffeine metabolism; it is not produced in plants in above trace amounts. Furthermore, synthetic methods to produce paraxanthine are complex, inefficient, and expensive. The research goals of this Phase I project are to use a combination of protein and microbe engineering to develop a biological method to fermentatively produce paraxanthine at high yields and with high volumetric productivities. The approach uses directed evolution to select for enzymes and microbes with improved activity, enabling rapid iteration of the experimental design-build-test cycle. If successful, this technology will not only deliver an efficient paraxanthine production process, but it also establishes a novel, scalable platform that can be applied to improve upon other food ingredients, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals.

It will create a platform for ‘secure-by-design' of integrated circuits using untrusted third-party intellectual property blocks. It will provide a tool to semiconductor designers to automatically analyze security vulnerabilities and address them before fabrication. Such a capability will lead to security improvement of the fabricated chips and the systems they are integrated into, while also reducing the cost and time for secure system design through automation of vulnerability analysis and mitigation. The proposed toolset will address a critical technology gap in the semiconductor design and EDA marketplace. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop a netlist assessment toolset which analyzes gate-level netlist of third-party integrated circuit (IC) design blocks used in modern system-on-chip (SoC) designs. The toolset converts the gate-level netlist to readable formats to support the existing security analysis tools in the electronic design automation (EDA) software market. During gate-level security analysis, this toolset will enable the detection of vulnerability for piracy, reverse engineering, as well as malicious logic in a design. To make the toolset market ready for our customers in the EDA and semiconductor industry, the SBIR/STTR Phase I project will mainly focus on scalability testing, interface design, analysis of security benefits, and performance improvement.

Today, late-stage protein engineering represents a major time, labor, and financial bottleneck. Since real-world translation is the focus of late-stage development, assays are more reflective of their end-use application and therefore necessarily require more time, labor, and capital. This precludes many variants from being screened at this stage. Failure at these late stages of development is costly, and often results from a change in environmental parameters from test conditions in early high throughput screens. Accurate prediction of protein variants based on minimal data but with high likelihood of function under end-use conditions is a critical unmet need. The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of leveraging a machine learning model, trained on raw protein sequences, mutagenesis datasets and natural sequence- function pairs, to predict highly functional variants of a protein of interest (POI) without sequence-function datasets specific to the selected POI and application. Such an approach, known as zero-shot learning, has not been applied to protein engineering to date. To achieve this, a large-scale language model will be trained with almost 5 billion curated unlabeled protein sequences from public and private databases and a collection of mutagenesis datasets. This general knowledge model can then be fused with an application-specific top model derived from natural sequences (distinct from the POI) paired with parameters of their natural environments. This training is hypothesized to imbue the model with a notion of which sequence features improve protein function in a general sense, and under particular environmental conditions (e.g., high temperature, high salinity, etc.). To demonstrate the feasibility and utility of this approach, the model will be used in virtual directed evolution experiments to optimize two therapeutically relevant enzymes, optimized for function in non-native environments, and assessed for this function in vitro.

Crescent Heights Blvd.,,Los Angeles,California,90035-2633,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long term goal of this Phase I project is to commercialize an in-home device that facilitates significant levels
of ongoing exercise while safely seated, that can enable intuitive engagement by the user, that doesn’t interfere
with tasking, reading or other activities, that can significantly reduce sedentary behavior, and that can aggregate
and display usage data with biometrics derived from other sources to present an actionable picture of one’s
health and remote monitoring of changes in health status. By doing so, we expect to substantially raise
compliance to prescribed levels of energy expenditure of a cardiac rehab program. This application requests
funds to develop the FitSitt, a highly comfortable chair with a uniquely articulating dynamic seatand back support
that actively respond to, follow, and support the userandapos;s movements while integrating a synchronously-moving
treadle with which to exercise legs. The technology proposed will transform sitting from sedentariness to
movement and exercise and may contribute preventive and ameliorative cardio-metabolic health benefits to a
target market of nearly 31 million inactive adults aged 65+ in the US and prolong years of independent living.
While cardiac rehab is proven to dramatically reduce mortality and provide important health benefits, it is woefully
under-utilized. Sedentary behavior is directly linked to a dramatic rise in chronic disease, but sedentary older
adults are not likely to maintain exercise habits, so the approach is for FitSitt to convert a portion of sitting time
from sedentary to active, distributed across the day, enabling movement experienced as effortless because it is
convenient, easy to use, available, and comfortable. Preliminary studies show that the energy expenditure at a
low resistance setting for the current Fitsitt 0.5 is equivalent to walking 1 mph. The primary objective of this
project is to complete development of an advanced FitSitt 1.0 prototype, expanding its features to assure safety,
increase technical merit and likelihood of feasibility for home use. The specific Aims are: Aim 1a:
Engineer/upgrade FitSitt 0.5’s features for optimal in-home maneuverabilityand comfort over extended periods.
Aim 1b: Design, then calibrate algorithms to collect use statistics data from on-board sensors. Aggregate,
correlate, and calibrate with heart rate data derived from a separate wearable. Aim 2: Validate data collection
and calibration, and evaluate usability of combined-feature FitSitt 1.0. Older adults who have experienced a
cardiac event within the past 6 months will have unstructured use of the chair in their own homes during a 24-
hour period and then complete a user experience interview and rating including a modified System Usability
Scale. Plans for Phase II include further refinement of hardware and expansion of software capabilities toward
commercialization, and the construction of 10 advanced prototypes for additional and extended user testing over
multi-week trials at home. The ultimate goal of this project is to combine into one platform the aggregation of
health data with a rehabilitative device which can be used to act on and improve that data through less sedentary
living and increased physical activity distributed across the day.This project develops an improved and upgraded prototype of a smart device which provides
comfortable, ongoing seated in-home exercise that does not interfere with sedentary activities
such as reading or watching TV while it tracks and correlates usage with health metrics. It has
been created to enable and fill the need for in-home cardiac rehabilitation opportunities and
reduce sedentary behavior with lower-body low-intensity exercise, because spending long
periods of time sitting is associated with negative health outcomes including medical conditions
that all-too-often follow hospital discharge. The potential benefit is that risk of a subsequent
cardiac event is lower, with fewer hours spent sitting sedentary, improving the quality physical
health and fitness of older adults, and maintaining independent living for longer periods of time.",  ,,,,ROGER  LEIB,,(213) 400-0817,roger@activsitting.com,,  ,

aggregation and deposition of mutant and wild-type forms of TTR, a homotetrameric thyroxin transporting
protein secreted by the liver, choroid plexus and retina. ATTR presenting as primary polyneuropathy (FAP) can
affect the peripheral, autonomic and central nervous systems (CNS). It is traditionally diagnosed by clinical
observation, Congo red staining of tissue biopsies, coupled with genetic testing. ATTR-FAP is widely
underdiagnosed. ATTR-FAP patients commonly have a 2-3-year gap between first symptoms and diagnosis.
ATTR affecting the CNS is difficult to diagnose and is often ignored or misdiagnosed. Recent advances in the
development and commercialization of disease modifying therapeutics targeting ATTR underline the need for
early and specific diagnosis. It is clear from current studies that early detection and treatment of ATTR and
other amyloid diseases leads to superior clinical outcomes, as measured by arrest of disease progression and
improved quality of life. As much desirable as is to treat the mutations, in practice, it is imperative to implement
a objective initiation point for early treatment. Clinical trials targeting ATTR-FAP have employed relatively
coarse clinical measures of peripheral nerve function which change relatively slowly requiring 12-24 months of
observation to see measurable efficacy. The drug development process would be significantly shortened by
monitoring the level of a pathologically related, quantifiable, pharmacodynamic biomarker.As with the Aβ aggregation seen in Alzheimer’s disease, misfolding/aggregation of TTR occur years
before the emergence of symptoms and detectable amyloid formation. These distinctive circulating non-native
TTR (NNTTR) structures are believed to be the proximal pathogenetic molecules producing neurotoxicity and
tissue damage, making them ideal candidate biomarkers for early patient identification, and as a pharmaco-
dynamic marker to monitor disease progression and drug response. We have developed a sandwich ELISA
assay using proprietary antibodies specific for NNTTR. We have shown that the NNTTR immunoassay can
rapidly and accurately identify pre-symptomatic carriers and V30M-TTR (most common mutation) and other
ATTR-FAP patients using plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. NNTTR levels are increased in
plasma of pre-symptomatic carriers before symptom onset and are reduced in patients receiving different
classes of ATTR therapeutics. Herein, we propose to conduct a full analytical validation of the NNTTR
candidate biomarker, aiming at developing a robust quantitative measurement of NNTTR. If we are successful,
further clinical validation and qualification will be pursued. The resulting NNTTR biomarker/assay can be used
as an early diagnostic to specifically identify patients who can benefit from targeted ATTR therapeutics, such
as tafamidis, patisiran, and inotersen, as well as additional ATTR therapeutics, currently in development, that
may be more effective in the treatment and prevention of CNS disease.",  ,,,,XIN  JIANG,,(858) 355-9662,xjiang@protegobiopharma.com,,  ,

and younger adults contracting the virus has become more common. Now, roughly 50,000 infections are
expected each year and about 40% of the people are not aware of their infections. Although, about half of these
acute infections can be cleared by the individual, the remainder will become chronically infected. If hepatitis C is
undiagnosed and remains untreated, severe liver damage and death can occur. HCV related liver damage is
now a leading cause of death in the U.S., claiming ~15,000 lives annually. Although no vaccine for HCV is
currently available, effective anti-retroviral treatment does exist to treat the disease with over 95% cure rate.
Hence, identifying people with hepatitis C (chronic infection) is a critical task to treat and stop the spread of HCV.
Currently, screening and diagnosing active HCV infection requires two tests. One antibody test to determine
prior exposure and one nucleic acid test (NAT) to confirm an active infection. However, this two-step procedure
is cumbersome and heavily relies on clinical laboratories; additionally, the antibody is not sensitive in the first
two months of a new HCV infection and missing these cases. Hence, the current testing procedure has become
the bottleneck for screening hepatitis C.Besides the current two-step approach, HCV core antigen (cAg) test has been proposed as an equally effective
approach for screening and diagnosing active HCV infections. Numerous clinical studies since the 2000s have
demonstrated a highly sensitive cAg test can be used to screen active HCV infection as effectively as NAT.
However, all currently available HCV cAg test can only be performed in a laboratory setting and require trained
personnel for operation and maintenance. As a result, this Phase I project is proposed to demonstrate the
feasibility of developing a highly sensitive cAg test that can be performed quickly and accurately at the point-of-
care (POC) by utilizing a detection platform based on the existing Blood Glucose Meter (BGM) hardware and a
disposable microfluidic assay cartridge. Today’s BGM is the culmination of decades of Randamp;D, designed for small
footprint, simple operation, low cost and large-scale production. Leveraging the BGM technology with a familiar
assay format for new applications allows us to reduce the risk and costs associated with device development
and scale-up production. The final product will be a POC system composed of a BGM based meter and
disposable cartridges for HCV cAg for measuring cAg levels in high risk individuals. The new POC HCV cAg test
will be able to quickly identify individuals with chronic HCV infection and allow early curative treatment. The
proposed product will also greatly benefit developing countries with high HCV prevalence but lacking testing
infrastructure.The project will include three development goals, including 1) develop and optimize a highly sensitive cAg
test using the BGM platform; 2) validate the BGM based cAg test in biological samples; and 3) integrating the
optimized assay with an existing prototype system.Project NarrativeHepatitis C is on the rise again in the United States and worldwide. Although effective treatment is available,
the current two-step testing procedure is too cumbersome to screen large number of individuals at risk or those
unaware of his or her infection to initiate treatment. In this Phase I project, we proposed to develop a rapid easy-
to-use and affordable test for hepatitis C virus (HCV) core antigen to allow fast screening for active HCV infection
at the point-of-care.",  ,,,,TIAN  LAN,,(217) 550-4939,tianlan.1983@gmail.com,,  ,

40-50%. In severe CS, end organ hypoperfusion from low CO causes multi-organ failure and elevated left
ventricle (LV) preload increases LV wall stress. For severe CS, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation is most often used and is fastest way to reestablish circulation, but it fails to unload LV in andgt; 50% of
these patients. Percutaneous mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices are used in severe CS but may
not fully stabilize circulation. Non-percutaneous MCS devices supply total cardiac support but require open
chest surgery for installation. Our goal is to develop a compact, single port, pulsatile ventricular assist device
(sppVAD) for total LV support that employs a minimally invasive single cannulation technique for implantation.
Compared to a continuous flow LVAD, our sppVAD system may further unload the LV when synchronized with
the native heart for counterpulsation. Our enabling technologies that form the sppVAD system are a valved
single lumen cannula (VSLC) and a valveless single port diaphragm displacement pump (spDDP). Our
innovative sppVAD system features: 1) Minimally invasive trans-apical to aorta installation by one VSLC
cannulation through small left thoracotomy; 2) Smaller spDDP without inlet/outlet valves and large dead space;
3) Lower blood resistance due to shorter pathway through LV via the VSLC that serves as both inlet and outlet
cannula; 4) Dependable total LV unloading; 5) Potential LV internal/stroke work decrease with counterpulsation
pumping. W-Z Biotech made an initial prototype of sppVAD system, which had 3.1 L/min pumping flow against
80 mm Hg afterload in mock loop testing. Our objective in this Phase I SBIR is to develop/fabricate new

and severe CS sheep model. Specific Aim 1: To develop/fabricate/bench test new working prototype of
sppVAD system (VSLC and spDDP). The 22 Fr VSLC main body will be memory alloy wire reinforced
polyurethane (PU). Two one-way inlet valves on VSLC wall will be in LV for blood withdrawal. Two one-way
outlet valves on VSLC wall near tip and a one-way outlet valve on VSLC tip will be in ascending aorta for blood
delivery. The spDDP will have rigid PU housing, a soft, flexible PU diaphragm membrane, and a 50 mL pump
volume. Only one 3/8” blood port will be made on spDDP for direct connection to VSLC. This sppVAD system
will be tested in a bench mock loop. Specific Aim 2: To test sppVAD system prototype in a severe CS
sheep model. Our severe CS sheep model will be used to test our sppVAD system prototype for ease of
insertion/deployment, LV unloading performance, counterpulsation capacity, and 6 hr reliability (n=5). The
sppVAD system prototype design/fabrication/in vitro testing will be done at W-Z Biotech while the in vivo
animal studies will be done at University of Kentucky. Upon project completion, the commercialized sppVAD

systems. Manual tracking is by far the most common method today but it is prone to human error since
samples can be misplaced, entries can be inaccurate, samples can be moved, removed, or added without
accurately updating the database.
Robotic freezers, on the other hand, keep accurate records but they (a) are very expensive, and (b) their
capacity is significantly reduced due to the robotics.
The goal of this SBIR fast-track proposal, is to develop a functional prototype of a system that will allow real-time
box tracking in a liquid nitrogen freezer. It will perform inventories without even opening the freezer. It
will guide the users to the desired sample boxes for retrieval and alert them to errors (and how to correct
them) when they occur.
When used with our liquid nitrogen temperature box mapper a cold chain of custody from multiple freezers
down to individual sample vials can be maintained and documented.
This system will afford many of the benefits of a robotic system at about 10% of the price and without
sacrificing any freezer space at all.
This system will capture the very large segment of the market between single freezers with
handwritten notebooks and Excel spreadsheets on the one hand, and expensive robotic freezer systems on the
other.
New electronics that is compatible with the challenging liquid nitrogen environment and the associated low
level software will need to be developed but other elements of the system such as the user interface can be
adapted from BioTillion‘s existing products. To mitigate risk, we have already identified and tested individual
electronics components that function at -196 °C.
The goal of the Phase I will be to design, fabricate and test (a) prototypes of the electronic designs needed to
read RFID box tags at -196 °C and (b) RFID tagged labels that can be read at liquid nitrogen temperatures.
The goal of the Phase II will be to use the Phase I results to develop a fully functional prototype of our system

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an entry receptor, triggering conformational changes in S that drive fusion of
the viral envelope and host cell membrane. Infection is inhibited by neutralizing antibodies that block the
ACE2-binding site on S, yet escape mutations in S rapidly emerge towards monoclonal antibodies in tissue
culture. Furthermore, monoclonal antibodies are generally strain specific, and many do not recognize with high
affinity both human SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, yet alone exotic bat betacoronaviruses that are a reservoir
for future outbreaks. As an alternative for biologic drug development, we have used deep mutagenesis to
guide the engineering of an exceptionally broad soluble decoy receptor that binds with tight picomolar/low-
nanomolar affinity to S from all bat and human SARS-associated coronaviruses tested. The engineered decoy
potently neutralizes authentic SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 with an efficacy that rivals monoclonals under
commercial development, and has desirable properties for manufacture at scale. The engineered decoy also
catalytically converts angiotensin II to vasodilatory peptide products that might directly address symptoms of
COVID-19, providing us with a unique potential therapeutic that has dual mechanisms of action. Our proposal
investigates whether the SARS-CoV-2 spike can mutate to escape neutralization by the engineered decoy
receptor, and addresses final optimization of the engineered protein as an IgG1-Fc fusion before advancement
to an IND-enabling program. For SARS-CoV-2 to become resistant to the engineered decoy, mutations in S
must decrease affinity to the decoy while maintaining binding to human ACE2 receptors. To identify such S
variants, we have used saturation mutagenesis of the receptor-binding domain coupled with a selection for
tight binding to wild type ACE2 in the presence of competing soluble decoy. Following deep sequencing, a
small number of mutations were found to be enriched, but it is unclear whether any of these mutations do
indeed preferentially bind wild type ACE2 and if so, to what degree they have achieved specificity. Based on
this preliminary data, (Aim 1) we will validate whether mutations in S can be found that discriminate between
human ACE2 and the engineered decoy, and characterize the variants for their affinities and expression levels.
Thus far, we can conclude that possible resistance mutations appear to be very rare and generally require
more than one nucleotide change within a codon, but further quantitative characterization is needed.
Simultaneously, (Aim 2) we will rapidly optimize fusions of the engineered decoy with the Fc region of IgG1 for
enhanced serum stability. Our current IgG1-fusion construct (which was based on rational, structure-guided
design) is highly expressed, stable and binds SARS-CoV-2 S with picomolar affinity. We will finalize
optimization of the protein by scanning suitable fusion sites between the engineered decoy and IgG1,
assessing protein quality by activity, stability and expression.NARRATIVE
The receptor for SARS-CoV-2 has been engineered as a high-affinity soluble decoy that potently neutralizes
authentic virus and has broad activity against SARS-associated coronaviruses that use ACE2 as an entry
receptor. We propose to use deep mutagenesis to identify possible spike variants that may preferentially bind
wild type ACE2 rather than the engineered decoy, and as such may be a source for escape mutations and
resistance. We further propose to optimize a fusion between the engineered decoy and the Fc region of IgG1
for a serum stable biologic suitable for advancing towards an IND application.",  ,,,,KUI K CHAN,,(206) 636-5013,kuichan5@gmail.com,,  ,

These materials will (i) have high R-values, (ii) be safe to install, (iii) not require toxic chemical and fossil fuel feedstocks, (iv) reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and (v) be produced securely in the United States. By developing new biotechnology tools to make these materials, this project will advance the fields of energy conservation and material science and grow the bio-economy. The new materials will be sustainable, biologically grown versions of the best known insulation materials called aerogels. As excellent insulators requiring little energy to produce, these biological aerogels will reduce GHG emissions. Being non-toxic, the materials will be safer to make and install. Production with locally-sourced materials will secure vulnerable supply chains revealed by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These materials will help meet increasing demand for green building materials. For example, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified buildings command premium new and resale prices, with under 300 certifications in 2007 growing to over 67,000 in 2018. Using genetically engineered bacteria, this SBIR Phase I project will develop an entirely new aerogel material that is a composite of bacterial cellulose (BC) and structures forming nanoscale cavities of air. This approach will circumvent the supercritical drying needed in the production of conventional aerogels, which is an expensive and energy intensive process because it requires high temperatures and high pressures. These biological aerogels materials will have excellent insulation properties comparable to conventional aerogels, (that is, high R-values) produced at a fraction of the cost. To create biological aerogels for insulation, the project plan is to (1) optimize production of the components (BC and nanoscale cavity structures), (2) use genetic engineering tools to merge the components to create a biologically-derived aerogel, and (3) create synthetic gene networks to endow the biological aerogel with hydrophobicity and fire-retardant properties needed for a building insulation material.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the target of more than one-third of FDA-approved drugs, and often come in
families that respond to similar classes of molecules. Any given GPCR can signal through multiple intracellular
signalling pathways, some of which lead to desired therapeutic effects, and others of which are superfluous or
deleterious to drug activity. For these reasons, we are constructing a platform to enable high-throughput screening for
functionally selective agonists — those that bind to the right receptors and trigger the right intracellular signalling
pathways. Here, we use this system for the development of functionally selective and biased agonists of the human
melanocortin receptor 4, a long-standing target for anti-obesity drug development.
We achieve this in two aims: first, by engineering sets of cell lines for the multiplexed, sequencing-based analysis of
signalling activity by MC4R and related receptors; and secondly, by constructing a high-throughput platform for
microscale chemical synthesis of small molecules. Together, these tools will enable direct assessment of functional
selectivity and ligand bias in a high-throughput format and create rich multidimensional structure-activity relationships
on an unprecedented scale, accelerating the development of orally available pre-clinical lead molecules for the control
of obesity.
Aim 1: A high-throughput screening platform for GPCR functional selectivity: Here we will seek to apply
Octant’s validated multiplexed transcriptional reporter technology to the melanocortin receptor family. Specifically,
we will focus this technology onto MC1R, MC3R, MC4R, and MC5R receptors, creating a system to measure the
response of each receptor on multiple intracellular signalling pathways. To do this, we design, synthesize, and
characterize new signalling-pathway-specific promoter elements and use next generation RNA sequencing to measure
these biosensors.
Aim 2: Construction of a high-throughput chemical synthesis platform: We will use acoustic liquid handling
robotics to build an automated system for single-step chemical synthesis. With this system, we will create libraries of
small molecules in microscale formats by single-step synthesis (~1 nmol per reaction). We will focus on chemistries
robust to the idiosyncracies of automation. This platform will enable exploration of structure-bias and structure-
selectivity relationships across wide swaths of chemical space.
Significance andamp; Innovation: Control of the signalling bias at GPCRs is pharmacologically important, as oftentimes
only certain intracellular signalling pathways are therapeutically relevant, while others may lead to side effects. Bias is
often identified in later stages of drug development where alterations of lead compounds for improved bias may prove
difficult or impossible. This also makes it difficult to understand post-facto why a particular ligand is biased in certain
ways. Most primary screens of novel chemical matter still rely on single-target, single-signal systems. Our work will
enable the use of ligand bias as a primary screening metric, and will enable the collection of GPCR ligand bias across
very large sets of chemically related small molecules.Project Narrative
We will develop a platform for the rapid, microscale chemical synthesis and screening of small molecules for the
potential treatment of obesity. We target an entire family of human GPCR proteins. Our platform can detect ligand
bias and functionality selectivity within closely related GPCR families in a single assay at the level of a primary screen.",  ,,,,CURT R FISCHER,,(510) 878-3703,curt@octant.bio,,  ,

The exposure limits for ethylene oxide (EtO) in ambient air have been recently reduced to 11 parts per trillion (long-term, 1/10,000 risk level). Monitoring EtO at this low concentration will require advanced technology. Current techniques require sample trapping and preconcentration to achieve the specified limit of detection (LoD), however the method suffers from losses at low concentration and is susceptible to cross interference from other gaseous volatile organic carbon species.

The optical technology demonstrated project is direct, sensitive, and specific for EtO. Our method does not collect, preconcentrate, or require any other sample preparation. The monitor achieved relative and absolute uncertainties better than the 11 ppt exposure limit in 

Building on the Phase I results, we will develop a field ready EtO that can be utilized for ambient air monitoring to assess public health risk, and to industrial fenceline/facility detection to identify EtO emission sources. The research goals of the Phase II program are: improve the zeroing system to eliminate consumables, expand the number of species that are ruled out as interferences, develop a field-ready quantitative calibration system at relevant concentrations, and investigate an alternative spectral region. Finally, the Phase II improvements will be demonstrated in real-world field measurements.

The end users of this technology will primarily be state and federal EPA offices and other local and regional environmental agencies, as well as industrial EtO producers and consumers aiming to comply with regulations. Our continuing discussions with researchers at state agencies (CA and TX) indicate intense interest in our technology from that sector, with initial sales on the 1-3 year timescale. We expect the industrial market to grow due to an evolving regulatory landscape, with sales occurring on the 5-10 year timescale.

Upon completion of the Phase II work, we will have researched and demonstrated all elements needed for a state of the art commercial EtO monitor that is direct, online, accurate, sensitive and selective. It will operate without consumables and be applicable to multiple measurement contexts, including ambient air, facility fenceline and industrial emissions monitoring

Hospital-acquired infections can be prevented by killing bacteria, molds, and fungi; and inactivating viruses on surfaces before they are able to pass to another person. The project will develop antimicrobial paints based on hydrogen peroxide (HP), which does not have toxic degradation products since it turns into water and oxygen. HP has a long history of safe use, without allowing generation of resistant strains of infectious organisms. The paints can improve hygiene, and allow more efficient cleaning with peroxide-based agents, from which the paints can regenerate their antimicrobial efficacy, providing durable protection without highly toxic chemical applications. Competing antimicrobial paints are expensive, have not demonstrated long-term antimicrobial activity, or have used chemistries that carry the risk of developing microbial resistance. The proposed peroxide based antimicrobial paint will be more affordable, and very safe to implement, allowing regeneration of efficacy during cleaning. This will enable more widespread use in public health and institutional settings to help protect against transmissible infections. The proposed project addresses the technical challenge of developing an antimicrobial paint that can be regenerated, based on the use of HP in the formulation to achieve broad-spectrum antimicrobial and virucidal activity with long-term efficacy. This project leverages new technology to produce paint coatings that can sequester HP into a coated surface in a dry non-volatile form. This enables the slow release of HP over time that can be regenerated by exposure to commercially available solutions containing HP. HP degrades into innocuous products. Bacteria and viruses are not able to develop resistance to its disinfecting mechanism. Hence, the resulting product and its regeneration process will be long-lasting, cost-effective and environmentally safe. Technical challenges to be addressed in this project include ensuring formulation stability, antimicrobial and virucidal potency and recharging functionality of the paint, and the effects of HP on paint integrity. The team will closely collaborate with specialty coatings experts to develop and test viable paint formulations. Anticipated technical results include a prototype version of the technology, and documentation of the research outcomes and further regeneration requirements.

therapeutics against viral infections caused by filoviruses, arenaviruses, and other viruses that depend on the
PPxY L-domain motif for egress and spread of infection. Some of these viruses, including Ebola (EBOV),
Marburg (MARV), and Lassa fever (LAFV) viruses, are highly pathogenic and classified as Category A bioterror
pathogens. We and others have determined that efficient budding of these emerging human pathogens depends
on the subversion of host proteins, such as neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated
protein 4 (Nedd4), by PPxY L-domains in the matrix proteins of these RNA viruses. The identification and
development of small molecule inhibitors that interfere with these virus-host interactions should effectively block
virus egress, disease progression, and transmission. In these efforts we have discovered several chemical series
of small molecule inhibitors of the host Nedd4/virus PPxY complex important for viral egress which led to one
analog possessing proof of concept in vivo activity in a Marburg virus challenged mouse model. As FDA
approved therapeutic agents for the treatment of these most of these viral infections are not available, our
identification of virus-host inhibitors that may prevent virus spread will fill a significant unmet need. Moreover,
these inhibitors will be broad-spectrum, and therefore will likely be effective against newly emerging viruses as
well as viral variants. As described below, we will use a rigorous multifaceted approach to identify, develop, and
validate PPxY budding inhibitors identified in Phase I as potent, broad-spectrum antivirals. The goal of this Phase
II STTR grant application is to optimize our lead inhibitors of VP40 PPxY-Nedd4 interactions to generate full-
fledged predevelopment drug candidates ready for IND directed studies. This will be accomplished by combining
the pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry expertise of the scientists at the Fox Chase Chemical Diversity
Center, Inc. (FCCDC) with the expertise and experience in the experimental aspects of antiviral therapy of the
Harty Lab at the University of Pennsylvania. We will realize this goal by optimizing our existing series of inhibitors,
exemplified by in vivo active FC-10696, for improved potency and oral drug properties (Aim 1), evaluating new
compounds based on two potent series for their ability to specifically inhibit PPxY-Nedd4 interactions and
subsequent VLP and surrogate virus egress (Aim 2), identifying compounds having suitable drug properties and

used clinical method of limb preservation, namely hypothermia at 0 to +4°C. We will build upon our base
preservation formulation, Unisol™, that has been shown to preserved whole large animals below +10°C for 6-
8h after total blood replacement with Unisol™ with normal functions upon return to physiological conditions.
We have also shown that Unisol™ can maintain blood vessel function for at least 6 days at both -7°C and +4°C
and that mouse hearts stored at 4°C for 18 hours in Unisol™ have a significantly faster return of heart function
than hearts stored in the gold standard hypothermic heart preservation solution Celsior (HTK). Encouraged by
these results we propose evaluation of Unisol supplemented with reagents targeting oxidation, apoptosis
(enhancers of stress tolerance) and metabolism (metabolic rate inhibition) in 2 specific aims using human
skeletal myoblasts and vascular endothelial cells to select optimal reagent concentrations in vitro and a rat
forelimb transplant model to evaluate the best supplement formulations developed in the in vitro studies. The
lead in vitro assay will be alamarBlue, however outcomes will be checked using alternative assays including
trypan blue, live/dead stain and MTT assay. Apoptosis will be evaluated if significant losses of metabolic
activity are observed 1 to 2 days after return to physiologic culture conditions. The in vivo studies will evaluate
the best formulations from the in vitro studies over 3 days of hypothermic storage by transplantation model.
Controls limbs will be preserved in Unisol™ and HTK. We anticipate that the supplemented formulation will
maintain viability and function of limbs for up to 36 hours, a considerable improvement over all current practice
methods. This innovation will not only increase storage time, it will also provide the opportunity for more closely
matched recipients and potentially induction of tolerance. Furthermore, we are improving on the most tried and
true method for hypothermic limb storage in clinical practice that is relatively inexpensive and easy to ship by
air. Demonstration of ≥24 hours of hypothermic storage with andgt;70% retention of limb functions will be
considered to be a successful demonstration of feasibility for progression to a Phase II SBIR proposal for
further evaluation in large animal models and ex vivo human limb evaluation post-preservation.This proposal is focused on expanding the cold ischemia tolerance time for limbs so that more limbs will be
available for transplantation using a hypothermic preservation strategy that builds upon currently employed
clinical practices. Very few limb transplants are performed due in part to difficulties getting the limbs without
significant ischemia-induced damage. Many of the unused potential limb donations could have been employed
for transplantation if more time was available from the moment of organ procurement to transplant. The true
need for limb transplantation in the United States has been estimated to be several thousand upper extremity
limb recipients annually.",  ,,,,KELVIN G BROCKBANK,,(843) 514-6164,kgbrockbankassoc@aol.com,,  ,

The current standard of care for COVID-19 patients battling SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited to supportive care, long hospitalization, and re-purposed anti-inflammatory or anti-viral drugs. Many survivors suffer long-term lung scarring that reduces respiratory function. There remains a need for effective therapeutics that prevent or reduce virus-induced lung damage and/or promote tissue healing. Recombinant human NELL1 protein has an excellent safety profile in healing tissue injuries and a virus-agnostic mode of action. NELL1 is strongly differentiated from COVID-19 therapeutics in clinical development because it can be manufactured large-scale, cost-effectively, and has broad utility in treating future viral outbreaks independent of causative virus, strain, or variant. The proposed studies will rapidly advance NELL1 towards preclinical and clinical studies using COVID-19 expedited path(s). This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the scientific and technical feasibility of advancing NELL1 as a protein therapeutic for the treatment of viral-based respiratory damage, including damage caused by SARS-CoV-2. The first technical objective is to demonstrate NELL1 potential in promoting cell survival under hypoxic conditions and reducing inflammation in epithelial cell cultures. After NELL1 treatment and exposure to hypoxic growth conditions, the survival of bronchial epithelial cells and accumulation of reactive oxygen species will be monitored relative to no treatment controls. Similarly, inflammation will be induced in primary epithelial cells treated with NELL1 and inflammatory marker abundance and cell survival will be compared to no treatment control cells. Success is demonstrated by ≥30% cell survival under each condition and a concordant reduction in reactive oxygen species and markers of inflammation in cells treated with NELL1. The second technical objective is to demonstrate in vivo efficacy of NELL1 in modulating SARS-Co-V-2 induced cytokine storm.

Trademark pending as SeravueTM, the test quantifies LC-SPIK, a novel protein secreted only in cases of liver cancer. Our Phase I and Phase II clinical studies have validated SeravueTMandapos;s ability to distinguish HCC in patients from those who have liver cirrhosis, Hepatitis B/C, non-liver diseases such as pancreatitis, as well as healthy control subjects. In 512 total patients, LC-SPIK had a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 90%, compared to only 52% sensitivity and 86% specificity for Alpha fetoprotein (AFP), a widely used FDA-approved biomarker for HCC. More impressively, SeravueTM was able to detect HCC in its earliest stages (BCLC Stage 0 and 1), where detection makes the biggest difference in patient outcomes and 5-year survival rate, with 72% sensitivity and 90% specificity. This compared very favorably to AFP, with only 42% sensitivity and 86% specificity. Finally, SeravueTM was able to give a true-positive result in over 71% of patients where AFP testing gave a false- negative result, offering a solution for the roughly 47% of HCC patients who regrettably test negative with AFP. Through our phase I and phase II SBIR funded development, we have completed the technical development of our diagnostic product. We have also met with the FDA through a formal pre-submission meeting to establish requirements for FDA approval and are amidst commercial license discussions with several leading diagnostic companies including FujireBio, Diasorin, and BioRad. However, while our technology and existing IP provide us with a strong foundation, there are several key areas where additional support is critical to commercial success. First, while our existing patents offer provide some direct protection, we need to further analyze the relevant patent landscape and strategize around epitope claims to enable more comprehensive coverage internationally. This will allow us to prioritize specific patents, claims, and international regions as effectively as possible. Second, we must further develop our reimbursement strategy, including additional discussion with CMS, which is something that potential commercial partners have explicitly asked us for. Lastly, we would like to work with a licensing advisor with significant experience in structuring and executing diagnostic licensing deals. This is a critical step in our commercialization plan and collaborating with such a partner would significantly strengthen this key area where we are less experienced. A CRP grant would allow us to address these remaining commercialization risks and ensure that the technical and scientific breakthroughs we have achieved in the last 6 years with the support of the NIH/NCI, for which we are very thankful, will have the best chance of worldwide commercial success.ImCare Biotech has developed an ELISA test kit Seravue® for the diagnosis of liver cancer which has been demonstrated to successfully distinguish HCC from other liver diseases and non-liver diseases.

ENR is set apart from competitive technologies in that it can meet or exceed strict regulatory standards for nutrient removal without biological processes or added chemicals. The United States has a growing population reliant on OWTS products, and many regions are increasingly experiencing negative enviornmental impacts due to nutrient contamination from OWTSs. At least 10% of new OWTS installations require advanced treatment technologies, and 2.6 million existing systems may require upgrades due to their location in nutrient-sensitive watersheds. Existing advanced OWTS technologies can meet local standards, but they are expensive, require a large footprint, typically only address nitrogen and not phosphorus, and have reached a performance boundary (.75% N removal or 12-25 mg N L-1 in effluent). Few retrofit options exist for in-ground systems, and these are also large and expensive. ENR provides two market applications: (1) Retrofits of under-performing in-ground systems to meet new nutrient regulations and (2) Incorporation into advanced OWTS products to expand their market reach to regions with the strictest requierments (e.g.

ENR utilizes memberances to capture ammonium (NH4+), itrate (NO3), and phosphate (PO43) ions in a concentrated stream with a proprietary electrochemical process to mitigate organic fouling. The concentrated nutrient-rich stream is suitable for resource recovery and the nutrient-stripped stream is safe for discharge. Phase I testing established the ENR proof-of-concept with a lab-scale prototype treating effluent from both a conventional septic and an advanced OWTS to .10 mg L 1 (from .60 mg NH3-N L1 and 35 mg PO4-P L1 in the conventional and .30 mg L-1 NO3-N and PO4-P in the advanced OWTS) without loss in performance over 7 days of continuous operation. Phase II testing will focus on conventional and advanced OWTS in partnership with industry leaders engaged during Phase I.

Market engagement indicates that the highest demand among end users would be residential homeowners in nutrient-sensitive regions with OTWS. Industry leaders have indicated ENR could support advancement of septage regulations, if Phase I cost and performance metrics can be replicated at scale.

NOVA Thin Film Pharmaceuticals’ (NTFP) mission is to unlock the full economic andamp; therapeutic potential of the
orally soluble film (OSF) dosage form. OSF pharmaceutical products were first introduced in the early 2000s andamp;
are particularly appropriate for certain therapeutic areas andamp; patient types. The ability to swallow an OSF easily
without water combined its portability made it particularly apropos for pediatric patients as well as adults or
geriatrics with dysphagia. In addition, OSF products have found very successful applications in systemic drug
delivery by sublingual or buccal routes to avoid GI digestion, gut-wall metabolism and hepatic first-pass
metabolism. The limitation to widespread use of OSF has always been the cost and waste associated with the
traditional solution film-casting process used in their manufacture which also makes rapid formulation
prototyping difficult. NTFP’s approach involves our patented film-by-deposit system (DepoFilm™), which
offers dramatic efficiency and cost advantages over the existing standard manufacturing methodology.
DepoFilm™ is an integrated process for film manufacturing andamp; packaging. The film former solution andamp; drug are
deposited and dried in wells that are part of a web that comprises the final package of the product. At the end of
the drying cycle, a heat-sealable aluminum laminate ‘lidding’ sheet is applied to complete primary packaging.
Yield loss is limited to very minor handling loss – we expect yields in the range of 96-98% which could even be
superior to some types of tablet and capsule manufacturing processes involving multiple unit operations.
Nova will license DepoFilm technology and offer product development services to ethical pharmaceutical
companies seeking to develop OSF formulations of 1) pediatric and/or adult formulations of their existing or
pipeline drugs, 2) drugs requiring buccal or sublingual delivery to avoid GI tract or first-pass metabolism andamp; 3)
other suitable drug candidates for which portability and non-requisite water intake are desired attributes e.g
acute or rescue indications. NTFP would work with client companies to develop andamp; manufacture OSF
formulations for approval using the 505(b)(1) or 505(b)(2) New Drug Application pathway. The elegance,
simplicity andamp; cost-effectiveness of our approach will also unlock OSF product possibilities in the Consumer
Health/OTC space that were previously economically unattractive.
Our management team is composed of a group that essentially created the modern pharma OSF industry.
Joseph andamp; Richard Fuisz helped start the thin film drug delivery sector, inventing the largest patent portfolio for
pharmaceutical OSF by solution-casting andamp; co-founding MonoSolRx/Aquestive Therapeutics. Madhu Hariharan
is a drug delivery expert who worked on thin film at MonoSol Rx, has several OSF patents, andamp; through his
consulting company Solvekta, has worked on virtually every major pharma film product launch to date.Project Narrative – Nova Thin Film Pharmaceuticals LLC (NTFP)
There is a major unmet need to deliver oral pediatric drugs in a patient-friendly manner that provides
improved compliance while being portable, ‘non-spillable’, compact and stable. NTFP’s DepoFilm™ technology
represents a disruptive advancement in Oral Soluble Film (OSF) by dramatically lowering the cost of
development and manufacture of these dosage forms. The DepoFilm™ platform offers compelling value for
ethical pharmaceutical companies because it enables rapid formulation prototyping, greatly reduced
development time, and near cost-parity with tablets/capsules – it opens up the possibility of buccal, sublingual
and intraoral formulations for Phase I clinical studies which can be cross-utilized for adult or pediatric patient
populations.",  ,,,,MADHU S HARIHARAN,,(336) 808-5359,madhu.hariharan@novathinfilm.com,,  ,

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the 6th leading cause of death in the U.S., costs the U.S. government over $200B
every year, and has the potential to compromise the U.S. healthcare system within a few decades if an effective
treatment or preventative is not found. Pharmaceutical research has been mostly fruitless, with over 150 drugs
having disappointing results in clinical trials to prevent or treat AD, including several drug failures in 2019 alone.
In recent years, it has become clear that the probable culprits of AD are toxic soluble “oligomers” of b-amyloid
and tau proteins that aggregate inside neurons. Through extensive pre-clinical studies in AD transgenic mice,
the PI and NeuroEM Therapeutics, Inc. have shown that Transcranial Electromagnetic Treatment (TEMT)
penetrates the brain to disaggregate both of these toxic oligomers, while enhancing mitochondrial function and
inducing consistent cognitive benefits. To translate these promising findings to clinical trials, NeuroEM has
created a first-of-its-kind head device (the MemorEM) for in-home treatment. Published results from the
company’s Pilot clinical trial in AD subjects have shown the device to provide considerable cognitive benefit,
changes in Ab levels within CSF consistent with Ab disaggregation in the brain, and evidence of enhanced brain
function in fMRI. In view of these pre-clinical and clinical findings, the FDA has recently granted the MemorEM
device “Breakthrough Device” designation. Given these promising, FDA-acknowledged results, NeuroEM’s
major thrust now is to identify a best set(s) of TEMT parameters for its pivotal clinical trial that are the safest and
most efficacious for disaggregating toxic protein oligomers. NeuroEM’s SBIR Phase I grant elucidated the ability
of TEMT to disaggregate three toxic protein oligomers (Ab, tau, and a-synuclein) in AD brain homogenates and
began determination of the most efficacious TEMT parameters therein. Our proposed SBIR Phase II research
is a logical extension of our SBIR Phase I findings by determining a best set of four TEMT parameters for Ab
disaggregation, and doing so in “cell cultures” studies wherein intra- and extracellular physiologic endpoints can
be evaluated for safety – both of these Phase II goals are important for NeuroEM’s Pivotal clinical trial, wherein
NeuroEM’s MemorEM device will be utilizing this best set of parameters. Accordingly, Phase II studies are
organized into two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Utilizing N2a/APPswe cell cultures, wherein secretion and
aggregation of Ab occurs, establish optimal TEMT parameters (e.g., frequency, power level, etc.) for
disaggregation of Ab; then elucidate Ab-related effects of TEMT on N2a/APPswe cell viability, mitochondrial
function, and protein production. Specific Aim 2: Utilizing three different primary cell cultures (hippocampal
neurons, microglia, PBMC immune cells), evaluate indirect (non-Ab) TEMT actions on a variety of important
physiologic systems to determine the safety and possible benefits of TEMT on: a) neuronal survival/structure, b)
pro- and anti-inflammatory function in microglia, and c) immune modulation in PBMC cells. These two Specific
Aims should thus identify a best set of TEMT parameters for use in our up-coming Pivotal clinical trial that do not
deleteriously impact important physiologic functions/systems either directly (via Ab) or indirectly (non-Ab). Health
Impact. There is presently no preventative or treatment for AD. If NeuroEM shows TEMT to be an effective
disease-modifying AD therapeutic through its multiple mechanisms of action, 5.5 million Americans who currently
suffer from AD would greatly benefit, as should the 5 million additional Americans who have Mild Cognitive
Impairment (MCI), the prelude to AD.",  ,,,,GARY W ARENDASH,,(813) 974-1584,gary.arendash@neuroem.com,,  ,

prospered, achieving sales of more than $176 billion in 2015. The structure and
functional activity of biopharmaceuticals are dependent on various aspects of their
production and environment. The presence of proteins having improper structures has
been linked to adverse drug reactions (ADR), which range from patient symptomatic
irritation to morbidity and death. The appearance of ADR’s has alerted the
biopharmaceutical industry to the critical role that protein structure plays in the
safety and function of biotherapeutics.Biopharmaceutical recombinant protein expression is inherently prone to low-level
errors resulting in sequence variants caused by amino acid misincorporation. The
expression system and culturing conditions can influence protein product quality
attributes, such as translational fidelity and post-translational modifications. These
protein variants impact product quality in a number of ways: altered function; altered
activity; altered ligand/substrate binding; perturbed protein folding leading to protein
aggregation; decreased serum half-life; diminished therapeutic efficacy; and undesired
patient immune response. Concerns for efficacy and patient safety necessitates the
need to characterize these low-level protein variants.Upon achievement of our aims, our Phase II proposal will provide biopharmaceutical
researchers a valuable, new software tool that will detect unwanted biotherapeutic
expression variants that can manifest as adverse drug reactions. Our software will
enable researchers to discover the presence of protein expression and post-translational
variants in a facile manner so that they not only understand the nature of these
alterations, but also may improve the expression process to eradicate these artifacts.",  ,,,,SCOT R WEINBERGER,,(650) 726-1060,sweinberger@gnxtech.com,,  ,

Uroflowmetry is the most common urodynamic test performed by urologists to assess the function of the lower
urinary tract. This simple non-invasive study measures urinary flow rates and when summarized graphically
offers insights into various types of lower urinary tract symptoms. Current systems call upon a patient to void
into a commode with a funnel to direct the flow of urine into a vessel placed on a digital scale which in turn
drives its output into a processor. The processor is connected to a printer which produces summary data
such as voided volume, peak flow, average flow, total void time, as well as a graphical representation of the
flow curve anywhere from 20-30 seconds after the void is initiated or completed. The physician or their
assistant will then empty the vessel, and the system can be used again. Traditionally the paper containing the
printed collected data was filed into a paper chart. Today this tracing is taped to a 2nd paper containing the
patient’s name and medical record number, and this is scanned into the electronic record as an image and the
data become non-searchable. Given this labor intense process, conventional uroflowmetry is ripe for
disruptive innovation.
We offer a hardware and software solution to these logistical problems. At this time our patent pending
prototype uroflowmeter offers the following benefits: 1) it can be used with any regular toilet (meaning it can
be used in an office setting or at home, and it can be used by both males and females), 2) it empties itself,
and 3) the data are acquired in real time, and collected on a smart phone or tablet. In this application we seek
support to develop the software that will allow this device to drive its data elements and the graphical
summary into a set flowsheet in the electronic medical record where all uroflows will be stored. This will allow
for a physician to review multiple flows over time to monitor a patient’s progress without having to open up
each individual image. Once this system is fully operational we envision this system being used in office and
home settings, and playing a role in drug trials that assess lower urinary tract symptoms. The instantaneous
detection of flow rate also means it has the potential for future applications in biofeedback training for selected
patients with specific lower urinary tract symptoms.",  ,,,,ROMAN  FEDOROVSKY,,(267) 679-4077,rfedorovsky@urogenie.com,,  ,

HABs have shut down water supplies to entire US cities in recent years.

Blooms occur when nutrient-rich waters stimulate cyanobacterial growth, resulting in unsightly sludges that discolor waterways, rendering them dangerous to humans, liverstock and wildlife because of the cyanotoxins released. Cyanotoxins make HABs very costly to clean up; as the algae themselves must be removed, and the water purified before it is safe to drink, enter or even be close to because of the risk of toxin aerosolization by wind-blown spray.

The treatments for HABs are expensive, environmentally damaging and of limited efficacy unless applied early in a bloom. The solution to HABs is early detection/prediction so that action can be taken at the earliest possible moment: reducing costs environmental and economic damage; and preserving access to clen drinking water.

Floating sensor buoys are the answer, but the current marketplace is crowded with complex sensor platforms that can cost $30,000 per unit and which require specialist knowledge to deploy, use and maintain. These platforms are beyond the means of millions of small and medium sized stakehoulders who mange small lakes, reserviors, ponds or stretches of beach and who are often hardest hit by HABs.

AquaRealTime was founded to provide a turnkey HAB monitoring solution for the small and medium sized stake-holder market, estimated at $900 million worldwide. Our innovative HAB sensor AlgeTracker, is affordable ($400), 8lbs in weight and can be deployed by a non-specialist in 30 minutes. AlgaeTracker also has an optimized detector suite that is best-in-class for HAB monitoring. And because AlgaeTracker transmits its data wirelessly over the cellular network and is accessed by a web-browser dashboard, it is convenient and easy to use.

This grant aims to further develop the beta version of AlgaeTracker to make it ready for the markeplace. In addition, we propose a predictive analytics system that will use machine learning to analyze the data collected by all AlgaeTrackers and allow us to make HABs predictions 7 to 14 days in advance. If funded it'll create a commercial network of HAB sensors whose data can be sold to US Government agencies, and other entities with an interest in controlling HABs. This will save billions of dollars as treatments happen earlier, cost less and have fewer environmental effects.",April  Richards,SBIR Program Manager,(202) 564-6462,richards.april@epa.gov,Christopher D Lee,CEO,(720) 980-0809,Chris@aquarealtime.com,,  ,

Companies across the chemical industry have pinpointed electrochemistry as a promising avenue for the implementation of more sustainable and energy-efficient manufacturing processes. However, the large cost and effort required in new process development hinders the implementation of electrochemical technologies. ML predictive algorithms can be a powerful tool to accelerate the development and optimization of more sustainable chemical processes, but repeatedly require large amounts of experimental data to train the models. These large datasets are often unavailable and expensive to obtain, which significantly limits the use of ML in the chemical industry. The project will advance future manufacturing by enabling the development of new and more sustainable chemical production routes using 50% less experiments, ultimately unlocking the manufacture of new molecules, medicines, and materials in societal applications. Moreover, by reducing the number of experiments required, the technology will significantly lower emissions and resource consumption in the industry. The proposed project introduces a ML platform capable of guiding experimental campaigns and data collection to enable accurate predictions of reaction behavior with the smallest possible datasets. The approach relies on the combination of chemical engineering and ML knowledge to overcome the optimization limitations found within each field.

Due to high component cost and extensive manual assembly, improvements in high-precision inertial navigation equipment has traditionally been slow, with system prices actually increasing instead of decreasing as in most other high-technology products. An affordable yet highly accurate gyroscope will open a $10 B market opportunity in autonomous systems applications, and it will provide disruptive, more compact new technology into the $2 B existing high-performance inertial navigation market. Possible market applications include sensors for consumer electronics, automotive safety systems, industrial robots, and national security systems. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new 3-D Silicon Nitride bandgap waveguide to enable small, high-precision integrated optical gyroscopes. Traditionally, on-chip Silicon Nitride waveguides are short centimeter length structures with optical loss on the order of a 100 dB per meter making them unsuitable to fabricate long gyroscope waveguides. Gyroscope waveguides typically require a spiraled sensing waveguide greater than 40 meters long to generate the sufficient Sagnac Phase for performant operation. Additionally, there is a trade-off between tight pitch waveguides that fit more sensing area per die, and the errors generated from optical phase coupling between neighboring waveguide spiral tracks. This SBIR will demonstrate a novel 3-D bandgap structure and process methodology to densely pack an ultra-low loss waveguide that will enable an approximate 400x improvement in optical loss and a 4x improvement in waveguide density versus conventional Silicon Nitride waveguide approaches found in today’s standard CMOS process. The results of the Phase I is a key-enabling technology for small integrated optical gyroscopes as well as other photonic devices that require low loss on-chip optical waveguides.

Abstract
Standardized behavioral observation methods are integral to developmental, educational, and behavioral
science research. However, existing observational strategies are too laborious to use in large-scale, intervention
and dissemination trials needed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In addition, current observational
strategies do not yield sufficiently quantitative, comparable and granular assessment that could drive the
comparison of therapies in clinical trials or the optimization and personalization of intervention. We are
developing a minimally intrusive medical device technology (“ARGUS-MDS”) to simultaneously
monitor multiple key social and problem behaviors in individuals with ASD and related
neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Our team represents an essential collaboration between
computer and clinical scientists with expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), NDDs, diagnostics, multi-modal
interventions, and psychometrics. We seek support in the form of a Fast Track STTR grant to validate the
psychometric properties of ARGUS-MDS and its ability to provide data on change in target behaviors in early
childhood and school-aged children. This would then support the development of a scalable, digital treatment
progress indicator for behaviors reflecting social, repetitive behavior, and associated symptom profiles in ASD.
In Phase I, video and audio data will be collected during gold-standard diagnostic evaluations individuals with
ASD (n=15). Aim 1.1 will establish quality and clinical validity of ARGUS-MDS algorithms for key social
communication behaviors, while Aim 1.2 will evaluate test-retest reliability of biometric output. Phase I will
show that ARGUS-MDS meets quality metrics for biometric output, validates the clinician-
technician feedback system, and establishes intraclass correlation coefficients for automated
social communication (AutoSC) output. In Phase II our focus shifts to establishing psychometric
properties of derived scores for AutoSC analysis, evaluating convergence with established clinical and
functional measures, and preparing for regulatory filing in Phase III. Aim 2.1. will develop scores from
biometric data through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of social communication behaviors. Aim
2.2 evaluates correspondence of AutoSC scores to scores on standardized clinical assessments. Aim 2.3
develops a comprehensive Validation Strategy and executes Analytical Validation, per medical device design
control regulation and FDA guidance. Phase II will develop scores from AutoSC output, evaluate
measurement characteristics of AutoSC scores, reliability and validity of Autos SC scores, and
executes all Analytical Validations per the strategy document and FDA guidance. Phase I and II
milestones will set us up for commercialization in Phase III, including filing for regulatory approval and
product launch. Successful completion of this project will provide a novel, scalable medical device technology
to support objective, automated clinical evaluations of social impairments in ASD and other NDDs.",  ,,,,ATTILA  MERETEI,,(603) 400-2440,attila@arguscognitive.com,,  ,

This will allow noninvasive detection of cancer at early stages, when it can be treated with potentially improved outcomes and in a less costly manner. Second, a complementary application of the proposed technology is to address an unmet need in identifying cancer organ of origin in metastatic cancers of unknown primary, where not knowing the organ of origin hampers designing an effective treatment plan in 30,000+ cases/yr in the U.S. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will accomplish internal development, and external validation of the proposed data analytic technology so it is ready to be validated on circulating tumor DNA data from blood, and can be used for metastatic tumors of unknown primary origin. The proposed technology addresses the problem of the unknown primary by analyzing whole genome or large subsets using predictive tools. Different cancer (sub)types have different patterns or signatures of somatic single nucleotide variations in the cancer genome. A library of these signatures is built using a large number of whole genome data samples with a broad cross-section of known cancer (sub)types. The unknown cancer organ of origin of a new data sample is identified by comparing its somatic mutational patterns to the signatures in the library. A key research objective is to identify the minimum subset of whole genome required to determine the cancer organ of origin to facilitate its application in blood tests.

Hybridization Chain Reaction: Highly Multiplexed Quantitative RNA and Protein Imaging
Encoded in the genome of each organism, biological circuits direct development, maintain integrity in the face
of attacks, control responses to environmental stimuli, and sometimes malfunction to cause disease. RNA in
situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods provide biologists, drug developers, and
pathologists with critical windows into the spatial organization of this circuitry, enabling imaging of mRNA and
protein expression in an anatomical context. While it is desirable to perform multiplexed experiments in which
a panel of targets is imaged quantitatively at high resolution in a single specimen, using traditional RNA-ISH
and IHC methods in highly autoﬂuorescent samples including whole-mount vertebrate embryos and FFPE tissue
sections, multiplexing is cumbersome or impractical, spatial resolution is frequently compromised by diffusion of
reporter molecules, and staining is non-quantitative. These multi-decade technological shortcomings are signiﬁ-
cant impediments to biological research as well as to advancement in drug development and pathology assays,
preventing high-dimensional quantitative analyses of developmental and disease-relevant regulatory networks in
an anatomical context.To overcome these challenges, in situ ampliﬁcation based on the mechanism of hybridization chain reaction
(HCR) draws on concepts from the emerging discipline of dynamic nucleic acid nanotechnology to achieve four
RNA-ISH breakthroughs in highly autoﬂuorescent samples including whole-mount vertebrate embryos, thick brain
slices, and FFPE tissue sections: 1) straightforward multiplexing with 1-step quantitative signal ampliﬁcation
for up to 5 target mRNAs simultaneously; 2) analog mRNA relative quantitation with subcellular resolution in
an anatomical context; 3) digital mRNA absolute quantitation with single-molecule resolution in an anatomical
context; 4) automatic background suppression throughout the protocol, dramatically enhancing performance and
ease-of-use. The proposed research will build on the unique capabilities of HCR to enable next-generation
levels of multiplexing for RNA-ISH, to extend the beneﬁts of 1-step multiplexed quantitative enzyme-free HCR
signal ampliﬁcation to IHC, and to develop the ﬁrst in situ ampliﬁcation product for simultaneous RNA-ISH/IHC,
performing 1-step HCR signal ampliﬁcation for targets RNAs and proteins simultaneously. During Phase I, we
will engineer molecular components to enable highly multiplexed signal ampliﬁcation, and establish a uniﬁed
framework for RNA and protein imaging. During Phase II, we will develop and commercialize robust technologies
for highly multiplexed RNA-ISH/IHC in key sample types critical for academic research, drug development, and/or
clinical diagnostics. These new HCR products will enable biologists, drug developers, and pathologists to perform
previously impossible quantitative analyses on large panels of mRNAs and proteins at high resolution with full
anatomical context.Project Narrative
Hybridization Chain Reaction: Highly Multiplexed Quantitative RNA and Protein Imaging
We propose to engineer and commercialize molecular technologies with unprecedented capabilities for simulta-
neously and quantitatively imaging RNA and protein molecules within sample types critical for academic research,

An opportunity is to tap into an unexplored diversity of human antibodies and develop them into therapies. This technology aims to identify drug candidates and select therapeutic candidates quickly. The established platform will be poised to counter emerging outbreaks and existing stubborn pathogen such as drug-resistant bacteria. The priority is the current COVID-19 pandemic, but this can be expanded to other potential pathogens. This STTR Phase I project will establish a novel discovery platform of human antibody therapeutics to counter infectious diseases. The rise of devastating new pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, calls for alternative and rapid therapeutic approaches. Traditional therapeutic antibody development generally involves animal models or/and affinity selection systems. They are expensive and lengthy, requiring multiple steps, including humanization, to mitigate immune neutralization. The proposed method identifies human antibodies (IgG) targeting a pathogen of interest in only nine days. The approach also capitalizes on an unexplored diversity of human antibodies. The pipeline begins with a collection of donor cells containing plasmablasts, which are modified to capture own-secreted IgG allowing for the enrichment of the relevant cells. The cells are sorted in single wells in a high throughput fashion. The process continues with high throughput cloning, antibody expression, and a preliminary binding and neutralization screen. The pipeline lasts nine days from cells to the initial binding screen, identifying hundreds of antibodies of varying characteristics. The initial screen is followed by further tests of binding kinetics and neutralization assays.

Efforts to replace ubiquitous petroplastics polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) with bioplastics is
currently hindered by cost. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a biodegradable polymer with properties suited to replace PP and PE. Unlike many bioplastics, PHB does not require industrial composting; rather, PHB degrades into water and trace amounts of CO2 in only a few weeks. The major bottleneck of introducing PHB to consumer products is raw material costs, which currently drives prices to over five times that of petroplastics.

Transfoam will utilize inexpensive waste as a raw material to reduce both the cost and carbon footprint of PHB production. Using 
SBIR Phase I funds, the complete conversion of waste styrene into PHB will be tested in genetically modified bacteria. Transfoam’s preliminary data and independent published research indicate that PHB can be produced in E. coli, and that styrene metabolism is possible. Transfoam, working with the University of Virginia, will complete three objectives to demonstrate this process is commercially viable: i) heterologous protein expression in E. coli, ii) efficient extraction and purification of PHB, and iii) confirmation of desired physical and chemical properties of PHB.

Achievement of these objectives will enable Transfoam to competitively enter the $1.2 billion biodegradable plastics market. Our interested customers include Bio-Pak, Mobius and goodnaturedProducts that offer attached letters of support. The biodegradable plastics market projects a 21.3% CAGR for the next six years; however, the existing ability to serve the growing demand is limited by pricey, unscalable raw materials. Compared to other bioplastic processes, the proposed use of inexpensive waste plastic as feedstock will reduce the reliance on virgin (unused and non-recycled) material in the biopolymer manufacturing process, reducing the cost of production up to 50% and lowering the environmental impact of production.

After validating the technical viability of our bioprocess, we will begin testing applications of PHB starting with biopolymer blends. As bioplastic demand increases, affordable additives are needed to meet the rapidly-expanding market applications. Increased accessibility to PHB will allow for a competitive price with bioplastic alternatives, serving the unmet demand.

Unlike petroplastics, which fragment into microplastics, PHB offers a nontoxic end of life. Transfoam impacts sustainability at both ends of its product’s lifespan by using existing waste to produce a truly biodegradable replacement and offers three environmental benefits:

1. Recycling existing styrene waste
2. Reducing footprint of PHB production
3. Complete degradation in 6-8 weeks",April  Richards,SBIR Program Manager,(202) 564-6462,richards.april@epa.gov,Alec V Brewer,Chief Executive Officer,(631) 747-0225,alecbrewer1@gmail.com,,  ,

Pathway #2: Ferrite Nanocomposite Based Soft Magnetics and Additive Manufacturing Laboratory research will be conducted at University of Pittsburgh laboratories, and the objective of this proposed technology pathway will target research and development of new ferrite based nanocomposite systems through self-assembly processes within the ferrite at the nm-scale, ultimately expected to be capable of operating at unprecedented combinations of switching frequency and induction levels.  Experimental efforts will be guided by targeted thermodynamic calculations to yield improved understanding of thermodynamic and kinetic factors dictating ferrite-based nanocomposite microstructure formation and evolution.  Target applications will be focused on switching frequencies > ~50kHz and approaching MHz-range for next generation transformers and inductors, with additional objective of demonstrating compatibility with additive manufacturing techniques to enable spatially tuned magnetic properties of components.",Vishnu N Sundaresan,Dr.,(703) 526-2110,vishnu.sundaresan@darpa.mil,Michael  Anness,,(412) 354-2034,mike.anness@corepowermagnetics.com,University of Pittsburgh,Paul  Ohodnicki,(412) 648-9585

The PAVE PAWS is a critical system in providing missile warning and space surveillance for protection of the United States and allied nations. Documentation for the subject Circulator lists Western Microwave Labs as the suggested source of supply. Western Microwave was bought by Signal Technology Corporation (STCO) sometime in the 1990s. It is unknown if any other companies are capable or willing to support this program by supplying the subject Circulator, but the fact that the device is listed by DLA as a subject to address obsolescence and source of supply issues leads MAG to believe that a source is currently unavailable. In the corporate world today, many original manufacturers of defense program devices have either been merged into other organizations, are no longer in business, or are unwilling to support programs with smaller delivery requirements.  From reviewing the schematic displayed on Sheet 11 of the provided legacy documentation, it is apparent that the Circulator is constructed from a pair of 3-port Y-junction circulators.  The basic operating principles of ferrite Y-junction circulators is summarized in this section to present a simplified non-mathematical description highlighting Y-junction circulator operating characteristics. Note that the example given is for a rectangular waveguide device, while the subject Circulator is a coaxial device. The realizations of both types of Y-junction devices are basically the same, with the differences occurring in the RF interfaces to the rest of the system.  A junction circulator is a 3-port device formed by a symmetrical Y-shaped waveguide transmission line arrangement coupled to a magnetically biased ferrite core — the actual circulation occurring at the intersection of the three transmission lines and the ferrite core. A simple model illustrating the junction circulator operation is presented in the technical volume along with a brief discussion of circulation and ferromagnetic resonance concepts which will give a better understanding of the circulation region.",Denise  Price,R&D Program Manager,(571) 767-0111,denise.price@dla.mil,Steve  Van Dyke,,(805) 928-5711,stvandyke@magsmx.com,,  ,

This dispersion is produced by introducing a narrow dip in the gain profile.  This is made possible by using a combination of Raman gain in one isotope of Rb, and Raman depletion in another isotope of Rb, via careful juxtaposition of non-degenerate quantum transitions in these isotopes.  Previously, we had built a compact SLAG;  however, it was not optimized enough to achieve quantum noise limited sensitivity.  During the initial four months of Phase I, we improved the stability of the SLAG by employing a vacuum enclosed, magnetically shielded cavity mounted on an Invar base.  We have also developed improved servos,  achieving temperature stability of ~0.05 deg C for the gain cells, limited by measurement accuracy, and frequency stability of ~15 kHz for the pump lasers, exceeding the stated goal of 50 kHz.  We have also developed a comprehensive numerical code for modeling accurately the behavior of the SLAG, which takes into account all Zeeman sublevels, and can be used to determine how the behavior of the SLAG varies as functions of temperature, residual magnetic field, and power and frequency of pump lasers.   By the end of Phase I, we expect to demonstrate, using this highly stable SLAG, an enhancement in sensitivity by a factor of ~one hundred thousand, under quantum noise limited conditions, thus establishing the feasibility of using three SLAGs to realize a three-axes superluminal inertial measurement unit (SIMU) for GPS denied navigation.  In Phase II, we will combine three SLAGs, oriented orthogonally to one another, to realize a three-axes Superluminal Inertial Measurement Unit (SIMU), within a volume of one liter (10 cm X 10 cm X 10 cm), with a sensitivity to rotation and acceleration that far exceeds, by as much as five orders of magnitude,  that of the state of the art IMUs.  Currently, AFOSR is supporting our work on developing chip-scale integrated photonic technology based components; this technology will enable further miniaturization of the SIMU.  We have two patents issued this year for the core technologies underlying the SLAG.  Prof. Selim Shahriar of NU, the inventor of the SLAG, is the PI for this project.",Jared  Evans,,() -,sttr@afwerx.af.mil,Selim  Shahriar,,(847) 491-5306,shahriar@northwestern.edu,Northwestern University,Nikki  Piech,(847) 467-4068

model fusion framework. The foundation of the R&D efforts is technology developed in theUIUC lab led by Kaiyu Guan licensed exclusively by Aspiring Universe. While that technologyhas been validated in an experimental environment the research focus by Aspiring Universe forthis project is to develop real-time capability and test and validate the technologies in realproduction environments.The project will lead to a solution that ultimately will be available to growers throughweb interface.

This is because high Ni cathode materials suffer from multiple failure modes caused by the high Ni content itself: 1) bulk destabilization of the structure in the charged state where oxygen is oxidized and lost, leaving Ni2+ which migrates from the transition layer into the lithium layer; 2) a change in nickel oxidation state  at the grain boundaries where the ordered, layered structure converts to spinel and then NiO, increasing impedance and promoting intragranular cracking; and 3) electrolyte instability at the surface, where Ni4+ and Ni2+ oxides serve as catalytic surfaces causing gassing and other decomposition pathways for the electrolyte solvent.    Single-crystal cathode materials have demonstrated benefits in cycle life, reactivity, and safety  through mechanisms that address the failure modes of high-nickel materials. Namely, single crystal materials have no intraparticle grain boundaries vulnerable to failure mode 2. Also, single crystal cathode grain surfaces have lower surface area and are relatively defect free compared to their polycrystalline counterparts, mitigating failure mode 3. âÂ¯Thus, single crystal materials can enable 811 and higher nickel contents, because both modes 2 and 3 are reduced or eliminated.  Unfortunately, the same factors causing performance challenges in high Ni materials also make the production of single crystal materials challenging and expensive, requiring multiple additional process steps when made by conventional methods.   6K’s patented UniMelt® microwave plasma materials production technology represents a solution to these challenges.  The UniMelt® process is high throughput, scalable, sustainable, and offers a significant cost advantage over the conventional coprecipitation method, particularly for single crystal materials. 6K has performed early proof of concept work showing that single crystal high Ni NMC material can be produced using UniMelt®.  In phase 1 of this program, we propose to complete the feasibility demonstration, achieving full electrochemical performance and demonstrating single crystal NMC with Ni contents up to 0.9, laying the groundwork for a low cost domestic supply of advanced oxide cathode materials.",Mather  Hutchens,R&D Program Manager,(571) 767-2502,Mather.Hutchens@dla.mil,Richard  Holman,,(978) 258-1645,rholman@6kinc.com,,  ,

The objective of this program is to provide a long lasting, self-disinfecting, antiviral surface cover designed to be mechanically placed over high touch surfaces, such as transit grab bars railings, and shopping cart handles that rapidly disinfects viruses rendering them non-infective. Broad-spectrum antiviral activity is continuously supplied by a combination of reactive oxygen species generated by visible light activated photocatalysts and silicone quaternary ammonium compounds that disrupt the structure of the virus. Both agents are incorporated on high surface area supports and embedded into the surface of the polymeric cover. Unlike traditional spray on coatings that have limited lifetimes and whose active components are potentially toxic, the non-leaching antiviral components are directly adhered to the support providing long lasting performance. All components are environmentally benign, and the system is non-toxic to humans. At the end of use, the surface cover is recyclable.

Mating disruption is among the most effective biopesticides formanaging various fruit crop pests including Oriental fruit moth. Although this tactic has provento be a viable alternative to insecticides for some key pests it is yet to be embraced as aneconomically viable alternative to insecticides in many fruit production regions. A majorimpediment to widespread adoption of disruption technologies are the number of devices neededtiming physical application of the product and the high product and application costs.OBJECTIVES:The major aim in developing the Tangler technology is to greatly improve themating disruption application process and substantially reduce its cost especially the applicationcost thereby increasing adoption.The Tangler system consists of a module loaded with pheromone and a launcher thatenables the grower to rapidly apply numerous modules to the upper tree canopy. The moduleconsists of a cap and a base each made of biodegradable plastic. The cap is attached to the baseby a cotton string. During manufacturing the string and release vessel are fused to the cap.Thestring is inserted into the base to allow the cap and base to be assembled.One hundred Tanglercapsules are coiled into 100 Tanglers and placed in a box clip. This clip is inserted into thelauncher operated by compressed gas.As a result of the bola design the propelled modulesreadily become tangled in the tree branches. It took a single applicator 30 minutes to treat a 1 haorchard with 1000. Currently registered hand-applied disruption formulations require 3-4 hoursto treat a 1 ha orchard at this high rate.The greatly improved efficiency provided by TanglerOFM will mean that growers no longer will need to skimp on the number of dispensers appliedbecause it is time consuming and labor intensive. Moreover their dependence on labor to usemating disruption and the expense associated with the application will be substantially reduced.APPROACH:First this research project will determine the efficacy of the Tangler OFM forseason long control and the long-term reduction of populations. Secondly compare TanglerOFM to the commercially available competitor NoMate OFM (Scentry Inc).Thirdly clarify theoptimal rate of Tangler OFM required to achieve mating disruption long term populationreduction and prevention of crop damage.Lastly optimize Tangler OFM's membrane toachieve the release of all active ingredients for the duration of the OFM flight with emphasis onproviding superior mating disruption.COMMERCIALIZATION:The goal of this research will be to develop a highly efficient andeffective mating disruption product for OFM that will prevent damage caused by this pest andincrease grower adoption of this technology in organic and commercial fruit crops.Furtherdevelopment of this product will lead to a dual or triple dispenser which will include Codlingmoth and/or Oblique banded leafroller.,  ,,,,Chandra  Maleckas- Bunker,,(616) 675-7474,chandra@ridgequestinc.com,,  ,

Several approaches have been considered for mitigation, with varying degrees of success. We have investigated these and other alternatives during the Phase 1 effort but we believe that an innovative approach developed by us has shown promise via detailed simulations. We believe that three other approaches warrant further investigation and testing. No extra weight or power are required for these approaches and they minimize complexity as well. We developed and tested a Software Defined Radio System (SDR) in an environment with characteristics very similar to those encountered in a plasma sheath. We also believe testing of communications through the plasma environment can be modeled accurately in the Phase II effort via our LinkBud Software as well as EM.Cube, which has a plasma communications module of simulation software. We further postulate that real world testing can be done in a Phase 2 effort by our software-defined radio (SDR) through an innovative approach using a Plasma Environments Generator providing real world test data without flying a vehicle at hypersonic velocities or in a very expensive ground test facility.

Commercial inorganic scintillators may offer some of these characteristics but are often expensive and not available in large sizes. Likewise, organic scintillators such as trans-stilbene single crystals provide efficient fast-neutron detection and good PSD but lack gamma-ray spectroscopy and a route towards large detector sizes.

outbreak potential. Found in 30 countries across Europe, Asia, and Africa, CCHF has an extremely widespread and
growing range. Its causative agent, CCHF virus (CCHFV), is listed among the urgently concerning pathogens
prioritized in the WHO RandD Blueprint. With at least seven regional clades, CCHFV detection by gold standard qPCR-
based methods has been encumbered by significant strain-associated genetic variability. Existing tests for CCHFV
are often limited to regional use, presenting a barrier to standardization and quality assurance. The WHO has called
for the development of universal CCHFV diagnostics as a global priority. Aldatu Biosciences has pioneered the use
of PANDAA technology, which enables probe-based qPCR for target detection in highly variable genomic regions by
simultaneously adapting and amplifying diverse templates. PANDAA uniquely mitigates the presence of target-
proximal polymorphisms to allow otherwise divergent templates to be detected with consensus fluorescent probes
with similar sensitivities. As such, PANDAA-enabled qPCR is an ideal solution for universal detection of pathogens
with significant strain, lineage, and/or sub-type sequence diversity. Aldatu Biosciences is uniquely positioned to
deliver a rapid pan-lineage qPCR-based CCHFV diagnostic. PANDAA has been successfully applied to subtype-
independent detection of more than fifteen drug resistance mutation (DRM) targets in HIV. Recently, we completed
development of the first pan-lineage assay for Lassa fever virus (LASV), another WHO priority pathogen with high
outbreak potential. We propose to leverage the unique capabilities of PANDAA to develop a rapid, sensitive
molecular diagnostic assay for CCHFV detection, and the first with pan-lineage coverage, through the following
specific aims: (1) development of a pan-lineage PANDAA-CCHFV assay, leveraging proven techniques and
proprietary PANDAA reagent design; (2) analytical validation of the PANDAA-CCHFV assay, including confirmation
of clade inclusivity and high specificity; (3) thermostabilization of the PANDAA-CCHFV assay, in order to meet the
requirements of diagnostics targeted to LMICs; (4) clinical validation of the lyophilized PANDAA-CCHFV assay, using
clinical samples representing a broad variety of circulating clades and geographies; and (5) multi-site evaluation of
the PANDAA qDx CCHFV test kit at reference labs at CDC- and WHO-affiliated partner institutions. As the first pan-
lineage assay, PANDAA-CCHFV will provide a rapid, standardized testing option for all regions within the broad
range of CCHFV. This novel, pan-lineage detection assay could ultimately be deployed in any endemic region on
pre-existing qPCR equipment in central labs, and/or integrated into a closed, point-of-care system with sample

This prototype will enable the integration of all Hyper Enabled Operator (HEO) Sensors, Robots and Things into all SOCOM Mission Command System (MCS) Common Operating Pictures (COP) at every echelon, vertically and horizontally, in a way that allows for the maximal integration of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning/Computer Vision (AI/ML/CV). This can help HEOs to orient themselves (through situational awareness) in their immediate tactical/operational/strategic setting, such that they can make informed decisions in a time dominant manner, enabling them to take decisive action while overcoming the problem of cognitive overmatch. Essential to this vision is the seamless integration of airborne Full Motion Video (FMV) Sensors with 3D terrain data, and the use of FMV and other Sensors to rapidly and continuously generate and update our 3D characterization of the SOF Battlespace. With the proliferation of FMV and other kinds of sensors, projected atop and continuously improving an increasingly high resolution 3D terrain model, the opportunity for cognitive overmatch is high. To render the additional Sensor data more useful rather than more overwhelming, we propose to prototype a HEO architecture that will rely on more autonomous and more intelligent components and workflows. We see an opportunity to enable HEOs to embrace the benefits of these emergent Sensor technologies, to tighten the OODA Loop, and reduce/eliminate cognitive overmatch. We also see an opportunity to ensure that the MCS COP at every echelon shares in this augmented situational awareness and the benefits automation can bring to mission command. Based on our existing work done with SOFWERX and PEO Strategic Reconnaissance, as well as our SBIR Phase I Feasibility Study, Botts-Inc proposes to extend and implement the open source, open standards based.

The lack of in-place navigational infrastructure means that cislunar orbital assets and mission landers must carry on-board all of the required hardware for vision-based navigation. Spacecraft carry hazard detection sensors, ranging and velocimetry sensors, and compute elements to obtain Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) data. This approach is demanding of computational processing and spacecraft power resources. Most onboard navigation systems are point-designed to only support the short-term service demand and will be essentially dead assets once the orbiter is on station or the lander is on the surface. Providing no more utility to the current mission or future missions, these systems have become a mass penalty and a burden of resource allocation that could have otherwise been used for increased payload capacity or expanded spacecraft performance. An opportunity exists to develop a shared cislunar navigation infrastructure by consolidating PNT solutions into a distributed positional awareness array. As the cislunar domain becomes an increasingly competitive environment among US entities, commercial actors, and other spacefaring nations, the demand for precision location tracking will grow. Operators will seek reduced landing ellipses to improve proximity to resource-rich territories, areas of scientific interest, or other strategically important locations. Prepositioned infrastructure acts as a security net to future US-led missions to the Moon by providing redundancy or enhancement to navigational functions. This infrastructure could also support Space Domain Awareness (SDA) by tracking the orbital or surface position of lunar assets and objects. With the proper cislunar navigation infrastructure, spacecraft could be designed for optimization with the potential to save $10M or more per mission in direct subsystem costs, maximize payload delivery yields, and extend overall mission durations.   In Phase II, Masten will develop a PNT ground beacon network and perform a demonstration flight of the SkyMage BRN network using Masten's Xodiac rocket powered lander. Four SkyMage PNT beacons will be placed around the test area to create a ground network. The Xodiac vehicle will fly a predefined trajectory and use a receiver to collect position and velocity estimates provided by the ground beacons. After the flight, Masten will use Xodiac's native navigation solution as truth data to compare against the SkyMage PNT data as a post-flight assessment of the utility of the prototype SkyMage BRN solution. This demonstration flight will validate the SkyMage beacons in a terrestrial system and provide a stepping stone to a future closed-loop flight, in which the SkyMage navigation solution would be integrated into Xodiac's navigation algorithm and provide a path towards a future Lunar demonstration.",Matthew  Scott,,(512) 808-8503,matthew.scott@afwerx.af.mil,Matthew  Kuhns,,(216) 308-6111,mkuhns@masten.aero,,  ,

Under this solicitation, the Air Force is seeking the development, demonstration and deployment of a robust, stable, reliable, and scalable receive-telemetry-link capability utilizing broadband RF communications from severely constrained transmitters in highly reflecting environments, such as large metal vacuum chambers. Successfully addressing this requirement demands an in-depth, multi-disciplinary understanding spanning several technical domains- namely, the physics of broadband, modulation-specific, RF propagation within highly reflective environments that exhibit severe multipath, fading and Doppler spreading; the utilization of novel bandwidth-efficient modulation waveforms, channel coding techniques, and advanced channel equalization signal processing algorithms that are more resilient to rapidly time-varying RF fading channels; the design, modeling and fabrication of miniaturized self-contained RF transmitters on host platforms with severely limited real-estate; and the ruggedization of these RF transmitters to withstand low vacuum and extremely high-G environments. As we elucidate in our proposal, the Verus Research team offers a physics-based, risk-mitigated, holistic technical solution to meet the Air Force’s requirements through a confluence of unrivaled subject matter expertise (SME) and demonstrated prior capabilities in these multi-disciplinary domains. ",Nickolas  Galyen,,(931) 454-5678,nickolas.galyen.1@us.af.mil,Sameer  Hemmady,,(505) 244-8503,sameer.hemmady@verusresearch.net,,  ,

There is aninefficient use of expensive assets significant environmental impact from idling trucks andincreased waste of perishable items compounded by longer than necessary transportation time.However the industry's top concern is its significant shortage of long-haul drivers--expected togrow from 60800 in 2018 to 160000 by 2028 (â€‹ATA 2019â€‹). Fleet managers identify the primarycause for the decline as the occupational harsh conditions often requiring workers to be awayfrom home for weeks at a time. This pain point is also well documented through numerousstudies (â€‹Melton & Ingalls 2012â€‹). Rural communities are under particular pressure because theyare overrepresented in driving occupations which requires them to be absent from their familiesand communities.Connect Dynamics Inc. (DBA Truckish) is developing a platform that enables drivers to sleep intheir own beds on a daily basis while reducing shipment delivery and truck idling times. Ourtechnology is designed to create a positive social impact while solving the economicinefficiencies in utilization of human and machine resources--particularly those related to thedaily 13-hour truck idle time. According to federal Hours-of-Service laws a driver is limited to11 hours behind the wheel per day. The proposed platform incorporates algorithms for changinglong-haul trucking from the conventional point-to-point model to a relay model. This enablesdrivers to meet and switch trailers along interstates and return home daily while the trucks andcargo continue to move towards their respective destinations.Project Objectives and a Description of the Effort: â€‹To establish the logistics softwareplanning platform tentatively named ""Relay"" feasibility the technical objectives will be: 1)prototype database design and algorithms tuning based on stakeholder inputs; 2) iterative Relaysoftware development; 3) simulation testing with large datasets; and 4) stakeholder interviews toinform revisions and Phase II requirements. We plan a development cycle to design and buildour Relay software backend prototype and tune our algorithms followed by a testing phase toanswer the following research questions in a simulated condition. The key metrics identifiedthrough conversations with over 100 fleet managers include the following:1. Return drivers to their domiciles daily 90% of the time - abiding by federal laws?2. Increase asset utilization by 50% from 50% to 75%?3. Reduce long-haul shipment delivery time by up to 50% - removingidle periods?4. Effectively address anticipated Relay disruptions through mitigation strategies?5. Quantify environmental impact for rural communities?Anticipated Results & Potential Commercial Applications: â€‹Trucking is a $700 billionindustry. Trucking software is a $2 billion market and freight brokerage is a $72 billion market.In the shipper segment our initial target is perishable food distributors. Relay's decoupling oftractors/drivers from trailers/cargo could cut delivery times in half minimizing loss and saving ontruck refrigeration costs. We have a Letter of Intent from one enterprise fleet committed topartnering on this project and a verbal commitment from a second fleet representing more than$500 thousand revenue on just one example route described in the proposal.",  ,,,,Aayush  Thakur,,(608) 609-2161,aayush@fr8relay.com,,  ,

Our soldiers, non-combat service members and their canine companions face the occupational hazard of snakebite while working in remote areas, potentially unable to evacuate because of combat or inclement conditions. It is estimated that worldwide more than 5 million snakebite envenomings occur annually with approximately 400,000 permanent deformities or amputations and over 135,000 deaths every year1,2. While not all snakebites result in envenoming and morbidity and mortality, often by the time patients receive the appropriate medical care in a hospital setting it is far too late and the toxicities of snakebite envenoming have substantially progressed and no longer amenable to effective treatment by antivenom therapy3,4. To underscore the urgency of the global public health crisis posed by snakebite envenoming, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently classified snakebite envenoming as a neglected tropical disease2. Furthermore, the WHO’s Snakebite Envenoming Working Group stated that the accelerated development of promising prehospital treatments, such as Varespladib, the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitor being developed by Ophirex, may lead to improvements in prehospital survival. Snake venom PLA2 is involved in virtually every critical venom effect and exists as a major weapon in virtually all venomous snakes around the world7-12. Phase II enhancement funds will be used to develop a low dose oral formulation of Varespladib to broaden applicability to a greater variability of patient weights and allow oral dosage in a patients with difficulty swallowing. Eventually, the Varespladib low dose capsule will be used as a first step towards development of a combination prinomastat and Varespladib drug to provide full efficacy against snakebite envenoming. Ultimately, treatments with Varespladib, in its IV and oral formulations, will support significantly better patient outcomes over current antivenom capabilities. The eventual addition of a metalloprotease inhibitor, such as prinomastat will provide complete coverage for snakebite and minimize the burden of snakebite envenoming globally where the burden is greatest and the need desperate for attention to this long-neglected scourge.",Mr. Dan  Dumas,,(301) 619-1678,daniel.dumas@us.af.mil,Matthew  Lewin,Chief Medical Officer/Chief Scientific Officer,(415) 999-5475,matt@ophirex.com,,  ,

Detection of viruses is a criticalpriority to mitigate spread of diseases that threaten horticultural crop health fruit yield andquality. The current methods for virus diagnostics are low-throughput and limited to detection ofindividual viruses with established sequence information. In contrast double-stranded RNAsequencing (dsRNAseq) is capable of screening large numbers of samples for all viruses in asingle workflow. NuPhY's USDA SBIR Phase I application will evaluate the feasibility ofusing a dsRNAseq-based platform for broad-spectrum high-throughput virus screening inhorticultural crops.During Phase I we aim to develop an accurate rapid cost-effective dsRNAseq-based system ofbroad-spectrum tree fruit virus detection. The first objective will establish virus detection limits(sensitivity) of dsRNAseq in infected cherry tissues and determine the optimal tissue type forsequencing-based analysis using Little Cherry Virus as a case study. The second objective willoptimize the high-throughput dsRNAseq workflow and establish a customized data analysispipleline through testing of infected and healthy tissues from cherry apple and pear trees.NuPhY's proposed work aligns with the USDA SBIR program goals because it entails theinnovation optimization and provision of an agriculturally-related manufacturing technologythat can quickly be deployed as a service to US tree fruit growers and nursery managers.Ultimately our technological solution will pre-emptively mitigate economic losses associatedwith viral pathogens while enhancing efficiency and sustainability within US horticultureindustries.,  ,,,,Seanna  Hewitt,,(509) 336-2249,seannahewitt@nuphyplants.com,,  ,

We are developing fast and low-cost methods to develop aminoglycosides with anti-ribosomal activities and reduced toxicity. In this project, we will identify novel aminoglycoside antibacterials, that show reduced ototoxicity. Complexes between ribosomal components will be exploited as targets for small molecule drug libraries that- inactivate the ribosome, stopping bacterial protein synthesis and causing bacterial death while reducing toxicity. This work addresses an important health issue, antibiotic ototoxicity, and presents creative steps towards a novel solution to this problem.  Cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR, resistance to 2-3 classes), extensive drug resistance (XDR, resistance to most classes except colistin or tigecycline) and even pan drug resistance (PDR, resistance to all classes) nosocomial bacterial infections have skyrocketed in recent years, and the emergence of pan drug- resistant isolates are making these infections increasingly difficult to treat. Hospital-acquired infections like these account for up to 4% of all hospital stays in the United States and are incredibly diverse in causative pathogen, antibiotic resistance profile, and severity. A significant cause of nosocomial infection is the Enterobacteriaceae family, which includes Gram-negative bacilli that can be commensal or pathogenic. Enterobacteriaceae have a widespread clinical and economic impact due to the diversity of infections they cause; this family causes many infections such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections (BSIs), urinary tract infections (UTIs), and intra-abdominal infections (IAIs). The World Health Organization (WHO) lists carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) as having a critical need for novel antibiotics on their Priority Pathogens list. Because the mortality of these multi drug-resistant infections is between 30 and 50% and there is such difficulty in finding viable treatments, the need for novel therapeutics for these pathogens must be addressed.  Unless innovative strategies are developed to produce robust and effective new classes of antibiotics, health care costs will continue to climb and we will completely lose our ability to combat even the most common infection. Influenza and coronavirus (SARS and COVID-19) create an even more urgent need for targeting resistant bacteria related to lung infections, such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), a common example of CRE being Klebsiella Pneumoniae (KP). A recent article by J. Gerberding, former CDC director states, “The patients at greatest risk from superbugs like CRE, CR-A. buamanii and CR-P. aeruginosa and other bacterial pathogens that can cause lung diseases, are the ones who are already more vulnerable to illness from viral lung infections like influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and COVID-19. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, for example, claimed nearly 300,000 lives around the world. Many of those deaths — between 29% and 55% — were actually caused by secondary bacterial pneumonia, according to the CDC.” A recent study (Zhou, Lancet 2020, 395, 1054-1062) from Wuhan reports that almost 50% of COVID-19 related deaths showed evidence of secondary bacterial infections (pneumonia, sepsis, bloodstream infections). Clearly, more work needs to be done to better understand the role of secondary bacterial infections in COVID-19 related morbidities, and develop non-toxic interventions in parallel.  One of the challenges of research in infectious diseases is to find ways to use the increasing knowledge of the mechanisms underlying disease biology, transformation and progression to develop novel therapeutic strategies for MDR, XDR, and PDR bacterial infections. Targeting heavily conserved RNA structures, present in the 4 billion years old bacterial ribosome, and involved in proliferation and survival of bacteria, is a promising approach. RNA, the essential nucleic acid component of the ribosome, is a validated target for drug design, both as therapeutic and as a target. The work proposed here, a multidisciplinary effort using rapid methods of synthesis, bacterial inhibition and zebrafish screening assays in Phase I studies, will be further developed in Phase II using in vivo efficacy and ototoxicity studies using guinea pig models. The success of the proposed work would be a significant addition to currently available approaches in antibacterial therapy. We propose using novel aminoglycoside modifications, patented NUBAD assays, and preliminary results from a zebrafish screening assay and mouse organ culture to identify conjugates that show reduced ototoxicities, opening possibilities for developing aminoglycosides that can target resistant pathogens with much improved therapeutic indices.",  ,,,,DEV P ARYA,,8646561106,dparya@clemson.edu,CLEMSON UNIVERSITY,  ,

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is commonly used in the critical care unit for gas exchange in
the event of severe respiratory and cardiac failure. Such circuits consist of one or more vascular access
cannulae, a blood pump, and an oxygenator composed of a bundle of microporous hollow fiber membranes
(HFM). Blood flow is drawn from the circulatory system via a pump and directed through the HFM bundle for
oxygenation and CO2 removal prior to being returned to the patient. However, ECMO has high incidence of
thrombosis and device failure, which are associated with activation of the coagulation cascade primarily due to
the non-biological blood-contacting surface of the extracorporeal circuit. Such thrombosis manifests clinically
as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, oxygenator thrombosis, and small vessel thrombosis. Hence,
systemic anticoagulants are necessary, which leads to hemorrhage and associated complications. The ECMO-
associated venous thrombosis rate is as high as 85% and oxygenator thrombosis rate is 10–16% depending
on patient age and oxygenator design. ECMO has high severe hemorrhage rate of 40%, of which 16–21% is
intracranial hemorrhage. Despite the development of advanced biomaterials, ECMO use continues to be
hampered by bleeding and thrombosis complications.
FreeFlow Medical Devices (FFMD) is optimizing and commercializing tethered liquid perfluorocarbon (TLP)
coatings on medical devices. The goal of this SBIR project is to validate the hypothesis that our TLP-coated
ECMO membranes will reduce thrombosis. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes for patients requiring
ECMO by reducing the rate of complications caused by thrombosis and bleeding. Our omniphobic coating
stops the adhesion of all biological components (bacteria, fungi, blood components) to the surface of medical
devices through the immobilization of a thin layer of highly inert and biocompatible perfluorinated liquid. Our
optimized coating technology incorporates a thin fluoropolymer layer on various surfaces with the help of
chemical vapor deposition technique.
The objective of this phase I proposal is to obtain the proof of concept that our TLP-oxygenation membrane will
reduce thrombogenicity under clinically relevant conditions. Once proof of concept has been obtained, we will
progress to Phase II for cGMP manufacturing of TLP-oxygenator and proceed with FDA-recommended
biocompatibility testing to make this ready for premarket approval. The goals of this phase I application will be
achieved by investigating the following Specific Aims. Aim 1: Optimize TP coating on PMP membrane to
maintain its original microporosity and gas exchange capacity. Aim 2: Optimize the LP coating to achieve the
highest thrombogenicity. Aim 3: Determine thromboresistance of the optimized TLP-coated oxygenation
membrane under ECMO-relevant flow-induced shear stress for the period of average use duration. Once proof
of concept has been obtained, we will progress to Phase II for cGMP manufacturing of TLP-oxygenator and
blood perfusion tubing and proceed with FDA-recommended biocompatibility testing to make this ready for
premarket approval.PROJECT NARRATIVE
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenators (ECMO) are used in the critical care unit to provide gas exchange in
patients experiencing severe respiratory and cardiac failure; however, these devices have high rates of failure
and thrombosis that can lead to a variety of significant and potentially fatal complications. We have developed
a novel coating that can be applied to the membranes and tubing that make up ECMO devices to prevent
thrombosis and ECMO failure. In this phase I proposal, we will obtain proof of concept that the coating
successfully interferes with the processes leading to thrombosis in preparation for a future phase II application
and application for pre-market approval.",  ,,,,SAIBAL  BANDYOPADHYAY,,(717) 661-3910,saibal@freeflowmed.com,,  ,

based protein market. CoverCress is a winter covercrop that is targeted towards corn-soy rotation farmersin the American Midwest. The unique feature ofCoverCress is that it doubles as a cash crop providing$50-70/acre in net returns to the farmer. This givesfarmers a financial incentive to adopt a cover cropstrategy because it more than offsets the cost ofplanting and harvesting the cover crop while providingenvironmental benefitsâ€•cover crops prevent soilerosion and nutrient runoff reduce pesticide use anddisease emergence and sequester carbon from theatmosphere. Additionally CoverCress is ready toharvest in late May prior to soybean planting and can be done using a standard soybean combine. Weestimate that CoverCress can bring a potential $275/acre in economic value to the US economy fromthe 35 million acres of corn-soy farmland in the Midwest about $9.6 billion overall. We expect thisvalue to grow through improved CoverCress varieties with greater yields and climate hardiness.CoverCress was initially developed from field pennycress as a winter oilseed crop withenhanced yields low fiber low glucosinolates and low erucic acid content (similar to the rapeseed-
canola transition). This allows for CoverCress oil to find applications in both biofuel and culinarymarkets while the meal co-product from oil extraction can be used as a source of animal feed. Toimprove the economic value of the meal this Phase I effort will test the suitability of CoverCressprotein in the emerging plant-based protein market. This market estimated to be $20 billion by 2023includes products such as dairy and meat substitutes baking ingredients dips and whipped toppings.Each one of these products requires a protein input with a different functionality. For example dairysubstitutes require exceptional protein solubility to make a smooth beverage while dips may requiregood protein emulsification properties. Prior encouraging results on pennycress protein revealed highsolubility and emulsifiability and we expect CoverCress protein to perform similarly.Our Phase I objectives are to analyze the functionality of CoverCress protein in order todetermine which end-products can be best served by the product. We will examine meal proximatecomposition protein solubility emulsification foaming ability and water holding capacity. This willset the groundwork for food development testing in Phase II. Additionally we plan to use robustgenetic tools to develop CoverCress lines with the potential to alter protein functionality and targetadditional products in the plant-based protein market. These experimental transgenic lines will betested for functionality and re-created using non-transgenic means (gene editing) in a subsequent PhaseII effort.We expect CoverCress to yield a high protein content from the initial feedstock and performwell in at least one functionality test (solubility emulsification foaming ability water holdingcapacity). This will enable the commercialization of CoverCress protein as competitive alternative toother plant-derived protein sources such as soy pea and canola. In addition we expect to generate atleast one transgenic CoverCress line with altered protein functionalities. This should serve as a startingpoint for creating a functionally diverse portfolio of CoverCress protein sources each one useful for adifferent plant-based protein product.Overall we are excited to introduce CoverCress as an added value for corn-soy farmers in theAmerican Midwest a source of potentially new plant-based protein products and a means to mitigatethe environmental impacts of large-scale agriculture.",  ,,,,Tim  Ulmasov,,(636) 891-5588,tulmasov@covercress.com,,  ,

In particular, the work focuses a novel estimation algorithm with nearly linear-time complexity that incorporates multi-fidelity, GPU-based orbit propagation, a hybrid Gaussian mixture sampled particle filter with adaptive domain partitioning, and an adaptive, statistically optimal multi-hypothesis filter that can handle massive constellations, nearly spaced objects, and slowly maneuvering satellites.",Stephen N Forbes,program manager,(703) 526-2236,stephen.forbes@darpa.mil,Edwin  Pease,,(505) 244-1222,ed.pease@tautechnologies.com,The University of Texas at Austin Office of Sponsored Projects,Renato  Zanetti,(512) 471-5145

There is a critical need to move advanced Central Nervous System (CNS) models into screening
applications for drug discovery and toxicology applications. Current in vitro models do not
accurately reflect the complexity of cell types and important cell-cell interactions and animal
models fail to recapitulate the human condition. There is also a great need for more accurate and
scalable models for developmental neurotoxicity screenings as there are 86,405 compounds
listed on the Toxic Substance Control Act inventory17 with little biological data to understand their
risks. Recent advances in stem-cell derived neural organoids have led to use of these models to
study developmental mechanisms, infectious diseases, and toxicology applications (18-26 and
reviewed in27-29), but their cost, complexity, and workflow requirements make them challenging to
transition to screening applications. Work performed in our successful Phase I activities at Stem
Pharm with iPSC-derived precursor and differentiated cells has demonstrated that complex neural
organoids containing a variety of neural subtypes can be developed reproducibly in a 96-well
plate on engineered hydrogel substrates. Unlike organoids cultured in suspension systems, these
organoids can be formed, cultured, and assayed in multi-well plates. RNA-seq analysis
demonstrated high intraclass correlation and low coefficients of variation. Importantly, we
demonstrated incorporation of microglia into the organoids and demonstrated their activation as
a model of neural inflammation as well as their activation or depletion in response to compound
treatment. In order to bring this novel model to the market we propose the following specific aims
for the Phase II proposal: 1) To optimize timing and seeding densities with cells derived from a
single iPSC-donor source, optimize incorporation of microglia to maintain robust activation
signatures but decrease cost and maintain data integrity. To compare a less-costly transcriptional
read-out, the TempO-Seq S1500 human panel, to our RNA-seq data obtained in Phase I activities
and to validate a qPCR panel for product release quality control. 2) To validate organoids
generated on our thin hydrogel coatings to enable better imaging options, microelectrode array
analysis and liquid handling automation and 3) Validate multiplexed assays to assess multiple
responses in single wells including MEA analysis, cytokine and LDH release and harvest for
transcript or protein analysis. This work will lead to the first commercially available neural organoid
containing vascular cells and microglia with broad applicability in both toxicology and drug
discovery markets.

Red tropical macroalgae â€‹Asparagopsis taxiformis presents an unmatched potentialfor reducing enteric methane emissions in ruminant livestock. With naturally high concentrationsof secondary metabolites that impede the process of methanogenesis in ruminant stomachs â€‹A.taxiformis is an untapped resource for reducing methane production from one of the mostsignificant sources of greenhouse gas. Currently livestock contributes 8-10% of total globalgreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With just a 0.5% feed inclusion of our algae we can reducethese emissions by up to 90%. However there is a limited production of â€‹A. taxiformis currentlyon the market. To meet the future demands for â€‹A. taxiformis â€‹production Symbrosia proposesestablishing an â€‹A. taxiformis â€‹nursery with individuals conferring desirable traits such asimproved yield bromoform concentrations and adaptability to region-specific temperatures.During this proposed project we will phenotype â€‹A. taxiformis individuals utilize transcriptomicsfor secondary metabolite production and generate a seed bank for future research withproduction partners.

Armonica Technologies, Inc. is proposing to develop a novel, high-throughput, label-free, highly
accurate, long-read DNA sequencing platform based on inexpensive nanoscale patterning and self-
assembly. The platform consists of nanochannels (cross section dimensions of ~ 100 nm); tortuous
(convoluted, 3D) nanopores formed by self-assembly of colloidal nanoparticles; nanoparticle barriers
placed across the nanochannels; and a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) field enhancement structure atop the
nanochannel roof. In operation, single- stranded- or double-stranded-DNA is partially stretched into a
linear configuration in the nanochannels, is blocked at barriers incorporated into the channels and forced
(by electric field) to translocate through the tortuous nanopores in the roof. The MIM structure on the roof
locally enhances the electromagnetic fields of applied laser sources allowing surface enhanced coherent
anti-Stokes Raman scattering (SECARS) detection of individual bases as they pass through the
electromagnetic hot spots, thus providing single base sensitivity and spatial localization. The distinct
Raman spectra of the individual bases allow label-free sequencing. Optical detection allows massively
parallel operation since the only requirement is separation of the pores by more than an optical
wavelength, which is easily accomplished in the fabrication. An important feature of the platform is that
the porous roofs allow introduction of oligonucleotides, small proteins, and DNA-binding/DNA
processing enzymes, permitting optional manipulation and modification of the DNA in the nanochannels.
The goals of this Phase I project are: to optimize the MIM structure for single base sensitivity and spatial
localization; to demonstrate single base sensitivitySingle molecule DNA/RNA transport and Raman scattering readoutin a coupled nanochannel/nanopore sequencing system.
Rapid, label-free, highly accurate, long-read DNA sequencing has important implications for
genomic and medical applications. A novel nanostructured platform consisting of nanochannels,
tortuous (3D convolved) nanopores, nanopore barriers and metal (plasmonic/metamaterial)
antennas is proposed allowing massively parallel optical readout with dramatically faster
throughput and improved accuracy than current technologies. Readout of the DNA bases is by
label-free, surface-enhanced coherenet anti-Stokes Raman scattering, a highly specific process

Oat crown rust canhave a devastating impact of oat production leading to losses as high as 35% in South Dakota and50% in Minnesota in 2014.Understanding their spread evolution and virulence requires a deeperlevel of genomic information than we currently possess.Despite current surveillance activities andample rust collections in various countries there has been a lag in the development of moleculardiagnostic tools. Pilot studies using the wheat stripe rust pathogen demonstrate ability to trace rustisolates to the lineage level and fail to provide strain-specific information.One of the mainchallenges in understanding many rust genomes is their complex (dikaryotic) nature where strainscontain genomic information from two independent nuclei. It has also been demonstrated that theevolution of virulence could be mediated by hybridization events between two rust strains (e.g.emergence of the wheat stem rust Ug99) adding to the complex genomic structure and presentingsignificant obstacle to genetic analysis and diagnostics.Using cutting edge genomic tools it is nowpossible and affordable to generate full chromosome-scale rust genomes and separate theirconstituent sub-genomes as was demonstrated by the wheat stem rust pathogen.We propose toapply this methodology to a set of diverse oat crown rust isolates in order to develop a referencelibrary of fully-phased chromosome-scale genomes that will be used as a foundation forsurveillance diagnostics and will enable the identification of novel virulence factors.

PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic, rapidly
spread worldwide and has had, and continues to have, a devasting impact on the global economy and individual quality
of life. Large scale testing and expedient testing at regional and national levels is required for improved
understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection levels to inform public health control measures and guide a return to
normality. While diagnostic strategies using nucleic acid- and antibody-detection tests have emerged, practical
and scientific/clinical limitations inherent to both these platforms have left testing gaps. The rapid waning of
antibody titers that is a natural phenomenon common to coronavirus immunity has been reported after SARS-
CoV-2 infection (3-5), limiting the capability of antibody-based tests to assess both infection and immunity.
Detailed immunological evaluations are, however, now indicating that antigen-specific T cell responses
generated by both symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection are more stable and longer lasting.
Thus, there is significant merit in developing commercial tests that detect antigen-specific T cell responses for
integration into the overall COVID-19 epidemiology and containment strategy. The overall goal of this program
is to develop a T cell-based skin test (CoroDetecTTM) to detect and assess history of SARS-CoV-2-infection.
Importantly, unlike most other testing systems, we will emphasize the production of a test that has minimal
components, does not require laboratory support, and provides results directly to the subject being tested.The following contains proprietary/privileged information that HDT Bio Corp requests not be
released to persons outside the government, except for purposes of review and evaluation.
PROJECT NARRATIVE
Practical tools are required to help health surveillance programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the
observation that antigen-specific T cell responses outlast circulating antibodies following coronavirus infections,
we will develop a T cell-based skin test to detect immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This practical test will
address a critical gap in the fight against this devastating disease.",  ,,,,MALCOLM S DUTHIE,,(425) 305-4646,malcolm.duthie@hdt.bio,,  ,

While conventional fungicides are relatively effective in protectingagainst fungal pathogens they come with a range of problems. Firstly many fungicides havestability issues and degrade prematurely upon environmental stresses. Fungicide formulationsalso have public health and ecological risks due to their unmitigated off-target drift. Whileemulsified concentrates or plastic microcapsules can overcome many of these issues thesetechnologies come with their own limitations and risks. Therefore there is dire need for abiologically-derived microencapsulation technology that is able to improve fungicide efficacyand enhance crop production while also reducing the ecological footprint of agriculture.With this proposal AgroSpheres aims to utilize their novel scalable bioencapsulationtechnology the AgriCell to improve the efficacy of a common fungicide Prothioconazole. Theresearch efforts of this project will focus on encapsulating stabilizing and achieving controlledrelease of Prothioconazole in lab and greenhouse conditions. With greenhouse trialsAgroSpheres plans to demonstrate that the AgriCell-Prothioconazole product can achieve equalor improved efficacy as the current commercial standard for Prothioconazole.AgroSpheres anticipates that in Phase I it will demonstrate that the AgriCell is an advantageouschemical application technology for agriculture because it enhances the application ofProthioconazole without relying on formulation ingredients that are known pollutants. Thus theAgriCell would become a commercially feasibly encapsulation technology for agrochemicalsand a viable alternative for formulations that currently rely on emulsification or microcapsules.,  ,,,,Sergio  Carballo,,(608) 772-7246,sergio@agrospheres.com,,  ,

Currently, special low-pressure chambers known as ""vapor cells"" are made by hand in a select number of precision glassblowing shops and suffer from poor dimensional reproducibility, low production capacity, irregular sizes, and variable vapor composition leading to a multifaceted limitation in the marketplace. Optical frequency references on the market today are large, costly, and power-hungry, but are used in a variety of commercial opportunities throughout industrial metrology markets. This study aims to produce a repeatable recipe suitable for high-volume production of miniature vapor cells. The results of this study will lead to the scalable production of references that would be intrinsically trustworthy and perform well in a continuous manner over many years. This STTR Phase I project will leverage micromachining of glass and silicon to enable a new fabrication method for a traditionally handmade component: a glass-blown vapor cell. The research objective of this study is to test if such a method can yield a compact and reproducible vapor cell. Research will employ semiconductor processing techniques and optical frequency metrology to deduce the long-term stability and accuracy of these vapor cells in order to assess their suitability as optical frequency references. The anticipated technical results of this study include a potential pathway to a mass-produced optical frequency standard suitable for optical clocks, interferometers, and wavemeters.

Box 1498,,Auburn,Alabama,36830,"The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is improved diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, the top cause of death globally, taking about 18 million lives each year. The proposed work will develop a contrast agent that improves the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance angiograms (MRA), by enhancing images of the vascular system, and which also shows an improved safety profile compared to currently utilized contrast agents. It thus has the potential to vastly improve the detection of abnormalities (e.g. aneurysms) in the aorta, peripheral, renal, and carotid arteries, among others. This product will bring significant value to radiologists and medical institutions that perform MRAs for diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis, vascular malformations, peripheral arterial disease, and in pediatric imaging. This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I will develop a novel iron-based, blood-pool contrast agent (BPCA) for use in magnetic resonance angiograms (MRA) with enhanced imaging capabilities and reduced risk of long-term side effects. Contrast-enhanced MRA is a staple diagnostic procedure for imaging blood vessels, and the market is currently dominated by gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) due to their excellent longitudinal (T1)-shortening effects. However, GBCAs are associated with numerous side effects and long-term gadolinium deposition in the brain. Due to their potential toxicity, GBCAs are designed to be rapidly cleared through kidney filtration – leaving only a short window for MRA image acquisition and resulting in poor image quality. To address the need for a safer contrast agent that provides enhanced vascular imaging, this project will develop an iron-based BPCA (i.e. one that remains in blood vessels), enabling an extended imaging window for improved vascular imaging in MRA, but which is then cleared by kidney filtration (minimizing tissue accumulation). Successful accomplishment of Phase I goals will demonstrate that the proposed agent achieves the desired BPCA that is cleared through kidney filtration, control pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, and demonstrates enhanced MRA performance versus GBCAs.

This application, “Discovery of PSD95 protein-protein interaction inhibitors as novel non-opioid analgesics”,
addresses the critical need for more effective medications to treat chronic neuropathic pain. Pain is responsible
for more encounters with the health care system than any other single cause, yet treatment options for
neuropathic pain have limited efficacy and carry a high risk for side effects, including opioid addiction. These
factors add an additional $560-635 billion annually to an already strained United States health care system.
Glutamate activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors mediates central nervous system (CNS)
sensitization, which is implicated in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. NMDA-mediated
central sensitization depends on formation of a multi-protein cascade complex at the receptor consisting of the
NMDA receptor bound to the scaffolding protein, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), and recruitment of
neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). By bringing these proteins close together, multiple signaling cascades
are activated leading to neural network reorganization (plasticity) and neuronal cell death. Small molecules and
cell penetrating peptides that disrupt this complex act as effective analgesics in preclinical animal models with
better side effect profiles than non-selective NMDA receptor antagonists and NOS inhibitors. Our team, the first
to publish a small molecule targeting this complex, IC87201, demonstrated its efficacy in preclinical pain models.
A similar small molecule, ZL006, is effective in preclinical stroke models. We designed and synthesized a unique
and novel set of IC87201 and ZL006 analogs, advancing one molecule into IND-enabling studies for post-
traumatic stress disorder. After identifying concerns with the candidate molecule, we systematically redesigned
it resulting in a new set of molecules. Further funding is needed to improve on these molecules prior to advancing
them toward new IND-enabling studies. Importantly, advanced toxicology studies with the candidate molecule
suggest a low risk of target specific side effects and predict an excellent therapeutic index for compounds with
acceptable activity and drug-like properties. In this SBIR Phase I/II fast track application, Anagin, in concert with
our collaborators and the Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network, will design and test molecules for improved drug-
like properties, confirm target engagement in in vitro and ex vivo assays, demonstrate efficacy in preclinical pain
models and establish a therapeutic margin using behavioral models. We will advance a new clinical candidate
molecule through IND-enabling studies. Compounds that do not meet our set criteria will not be advanced. At
the conclusion of these studies, we will have a new clinical candidate thoroughly interrogated and poised for
testing in clinical trials for chronic pain. Data summarized in this proposal strongly suggests that our approach
will yield effective analgesics with better therapeutic indices than other compounds in development or the clinic.
These compounds are likely to be useful in many other glutamate-driven CNS diseases.Project Narrative
Chronic pain is a major health crisis for millions of Americans in part due to ineffective treatments with
significant side effects. Our non-opioid approach targets a specific pathway which we believe will lead to new
drugs that are safe and effective. We have assembled a team of highly experienced researchers to solve this
difficult problem and advance these new compounds toward clinical trials.",  ,,,,STEPHANIE K FLORIO,,(206) 920-3510,stephanie.florio@anagin.com,,  ,
OUTCOME REFERRALS INC,Placement Success Predictor: Using Site-Customized Machine Learning Models to Predict the Best Level of Care Placement for Each Child's Behavioral Health Needs,Department of Health and Human Services,National Institutes of Health,Phase I,SBIR,R43MH125486,1R43MH125486-01,3/15/21,9/14/22,PA18-566,2018.0,4/6/20,4/3/20,104,2021.0,220720.0,LSSHAWGCG737,68609547,N,N,N,16.0,https://www.outcomereferrals.com,1 SPEEN ST,STE 130,FRAMINGHAM,Massachusetts,01701-4699,"ABSTRACTHundreds of thousands of children (669,799) were confirmed victims of maltreatment in the United States
in 2017; in that same year, of the 442,733 children in foster care, 34% had been in more than one placement
and 11% were in a group home or institution. Out-of-home placement decisions have extremely high stakes
for the present and future well-being of these children because some placement types, and multiple
placements, are associated with poor outcomes. With the Family First Prevention Act, states will be required to
pay the average $88,000 per year to keep a child in residential care if that high level of care is not authorized.
But which children require --and, more importantly, would benefit-- from a placement in residential care?
Decision-making support tools currently used by states to recommend specific level of care (LOC) placements
for children do not maximize the rich data and innovative methodological approaches that are being explored in
other fields like medicine. In addition, structured decision making (SDM) has been used to guide decisions
about risk in child welfare settings but, in comparison to predictive modelling, SDM is limited by the use of a
smaller group of factors to make recommendations. Outcome Referrals, Inc. has employed sophisticated
machine learning techniques over the past 10 years to risk-adjust behavioral health outcome data for clients
using baseline characteristics. Initial models predicted more than 30% of the outcome variance (i.e., it was
possible to predict 30% of the variance in how depressed a client would be at follow-up). The next model
improved that prediction to more than 50%, and our latest model has increased this to an average of 71%.
With the assistance of Phase I NIH SBIR funding, we plan to improve the success rates of children in the child
welfare system with an innovative, scientifically-derived product called “Placement Success Predictor.” To
guide level-of-care decision-making, this product will use site-customized, machine learning algorithms to
predict the likelihood of an adolescent having a good outcome in a particular placement type in a specific
community. We have preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility of developing these models based on
work supported by the Duke Endowment Foundation. During this six-month Phase I project, we propose to 1)
validate these preliminary machine learning models by applying them to new client data from our partner
behavioral health organization, 2) explore options for sharing results of these models to facilitate their use in
practice (e.g., aggregate predictions across different domains in a weighted way), 3) assess key stakeholder
satisfaction with a new prototype, and 4) develop and test customized models for multiple placement types with
a state-wide child welfare and juvenile justice dataset.PROJECT NARRATIVEHundreds of thousands of children were confirmed victims of maltreatment in the United
States in 2017; in that same year, of the 442,733 children in foster care, approximately one out
of 10 were placed in a group home or institution. Out-of-home placement decisions have
extremely high stakes for the present and future well-being of these vulnerable children because
some placements, and multiple placements, are associated with poor outcomes. The likelihood
of success recommendations provided by the proposed “Placement Success Predictor” tool will
help placement staff and administrators identify the best placement setting for each child using
machine-learning statistics to predict the child’s chances of success in each potential treatment
setting.",  ,,,,KIMBERLEE J TRUDEAU,,(917) 538-1143,ktrudeau@outcomereferrals.com,,  ,

The problem is a fundamental physics limitation of the underlying silicon. No processing tricks or shortcuts exist that can produce a significant improvement in the radiation tolerance of SiPMs. Radiation tolerance can only be achieved using a wide band gap semiconductor for the gain region. We propose a novel silicon based Photomultiplier Chip using a silicon absorbing region coupled to a novel, radiation tolerant, wide band gap gain region. The potential is to achieve quantum efficiency equivalent to the best available SiPMs while simultaneously suppressing dark count rates, enabling high temperature operation with low dark count rates, both pre- and post- irradiation. The approach is a high-risk / high-reward approach. We therefore propose to provide experimental demonstration of the validity of the approach in Phase I by demonstrating successful operation of the fundamental building block of the Photomultiplier Chip: the single photon avalanche diode (SPAD). In Phase II, arrays of these SPADs will be interconnected with monolithic quenching circuits to achieve large area Photomultiplier Chips and the devices will be characterized for radiation tolerance.",Hank N Zhu,Dr.,(571) 616-6555,hongguo.zhu.civ@mail.mil,Eric  Harmon,,(508) 809-9052,harmon@lightspintech.com,,  ,

Common tests are routinely performed on patients who suffer from conditions like atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, or have had heart valve replacement. These conditions affect millions of patients in the US alone and represent $2 B of spending annually. However, many current solutions cannot accurately or conveniently perform multiple blood clotting tests on the same system or sample, causing clinically significant problems for end-users and raising the cost and inconvenience of performing these tests routinely. The technology in this project will enable various blood clotting tests to be performed in a single portable system. This will potentially lead to cheaper and more convenient blood coagulation testing for medical professionals and improve medical outcomes by bringing accurate and multiple tests to a single portable devices. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a technology that will enable the first-of-its-kind implementation of a point of care (POC) direct, mechanical test in a meter and single-use disposable card format, to more closely replicate the mechanical methods that underpin blood clotting tests in the clinical laboratory. As a mechanical measurement, the card will measure physical properties of a clotting whole blood sample and account for confounding factors, such as hematocrit. Specifically, the objective of the project will be to develop a POC, hand-held, battery-operated system that can enable the generation of a viscoelastic curve and associated thromboelastography parameters in less than 10 minutes, a significant improvement over current bulky and labor-intensive solutions with turnaround times of up to 30 minutes or more. Beyond addressing the thromboelastography needs, the proposed broad-spectrum portable hemostasis platform can be extended to other coagulation tests based on fluid mechanical characterization of a blood sample, including prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and activated clotting time. This project will demonstrate the implementation of a blood coagulation test in a portable POC system.

Increased urbanization worldwide and demand for high quality, comfortable ambient air environments is expected to drive an existing market for improved heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems estimated at $12 billion nationally and $190 billion worldwide by 2026. Respiratory disease and human illness are attributed to unregulated amounts of these constituents in indoor air. This project will inform users about the concentrations and identities of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in recirculated indoor air from energy-efficient HVAC systems. This will inform clinical analyses of disease, industrial process monitoring, screening of food purity and authenticity, and commercial aviation security. This SBIR Phase I project will leverage discoveries in the chemistry of ion fragmentation in strong electric fields in air at ambient pressure and the association of these fragments with molecular identity. Additional merit is derived from algorithms for identification of ion spectra, dependences of fragmentation on electric field strength, and processes to handle ions both in the initial step of ion selection and the final stage of fragment ion analysis. This will be a novel exploration of strong electric field fragmentation of gas ions at ambient pressure. Research objectives include tasks to establish broad understanding of mechanisms of ion fragmentation of volatile organic compounds as gas ions at ambient pressure and establishing autonomous molecular identification using spectral profiles from mobility analysis. The research is organized into three phases including the development of efficient, advanced control of ion fragmentation, the discovery of chemical rules governing ion fragmentation, and the integration of artificial intelligence with chemical instrumentation developed in this project. The key technical result anticipated in this project is a chemical analyzer for autonomous monitoring of the quality of recirculated indoor air in green heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems in green buildings.

In discussion with the DTRA, databases will be selected that model a wide variety of regional specific SNP profiles, along with databases that can be used to model deeper IBD characteristics. In addition, detailed requirements will be established, including the criteria for ancestry-estimation, proper security procedures to be established, user interface needs, and performance, facilities and hardware requirements. At the completion of Phase I, Lynntech will provide a final report and demonstrate the preliminary architecture to the cognizant project officer. The final report will include an analysis of the architecture performance using unambiguous statistical methods, a description of the system parameterization, and a thoughtful discussion of the limitations and weaknesses of the approach. The report will also include Lynntech’s plans for the development, during Phase II, of Quick-SNP’s user interface.",Heather N Meeks,Dr.,(571) 616-5933,heather.n.meeks4.civ@mail.mil,Mark  Harlow,,(979) 764-2200,Mark.Harlow@Lynntech.com,,  ,

Chronic heart failure is a highly prevalent and costly disease marked by frequent exacerbations
leading to recurrent hospitalizations. Heart failure patients have extraordinarily high
hospitalization rates for fluid overload, which can often be avoided if exacerbations are detected
early and diuretic therapy is intensified in the outpatient setting. Unfortunately, self-
measurement of weights and self-reporting of symptoms have proven ineffective. The utility of
home monitoring technologies has been limited by poor adherence to self-measurement, self-
transmission of data, or self-application of wearables. Implantable devices have shown success
but are invasive and expensive. Non-contact sensors are currently position-dependent and not
compatible with multiple persons sleeping in the same bed. Nightingale Labs was founded to
commercialize a non-contact adherence-independent sensor called Bedscales. Our preliminary
results show that the low-profile mechanical sensors, when placed beneath the legs of a home
bed, can perform adherence-independent sensing of total body weight, movements,
respirations, and cardiac signals for months without patient interaction, even if the bed is shared
by partners or pets. The overall goal of this Phase I SBIR is to define sensor accuracy in a real-
world heart failure population in preparation for a prospective clinical study in Phase 2. By
defining the signatures of impending hospitalization, BedScales aims to make outpatient
management of heart failure a data-driven science.PROJECT NARRATIVE:
Heart failure is a high prevalent chronic disease of older adults that leads to fluid overload
causing weight gain, shortness of breath, and arrhythmias. Existing sensors for managing heart
failure in the outpatient setting are invasive, require self-measurement, or are not compatible
with people who share a bed. BedScales is a non-contact sensor solves these problems and
aims to improve the care of older adults with heart failure.",  ,,,,RAYMOND C CHAN,,(617) 869-9339,rchan@nightingalelabs.com,,  ,

This Phase II project aims to develop an automated system for high-yield pancreatic islet isolation for
use in islet transplantation (an emerging therapy for type 1 diabetes) and diabetes research. The
effectiveness of islet transplantation relies critically on the quality and quantity of the transplanted islets,
which are isolated from deceased human donor pancreata. However, the current method for islet
isolation is highly user-dependent, provides low numbers of islets, and suffers close to 50% process
failure rates. These drawbacks necessitate the frequent use of many donor pancreata and multiple
transplants per patient to achieve good outcomes, making islet transplantation highly inefficient and cost-
prohibitive. The lack of a reliable and easy-to-use tool for islet isolation also precludes many researchers
from obtaining high-quality islets for their research. To overcome these limitations, CG Scientific is
developing a patent-pending “automated cell isolation platform” (ACIP) technology to create an
automated system for islet isolation. The technology has a unique configuration to (1) enable efficient
enzyme digestion, (2) automate the isolation process in a closed-system format, and (3) break through
limitations that prevent current methods from achieving high islet recovery and viability. Using porcine
pancreata as a model system in Phase I, the company has demonstrated successful islet isolation, with
~2.4x higher islet recovery compared to the current method and an unmatched islet viability of ~95% on
average. The islets exhibit outstanding morphology and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion function.
The automated system will potentially eliminate user-related process failure and render single-donor islet
transplantation highly efficacious―using only one donor pancreas and one transplant per recipient―with
up to 80% cost reduction. In Phase II, the investigator team will (1) develop a fully functional product
prototype, (2) optimize the performance of the automated prototype for both human and porcine islets,
(3) benchmark superior islet isolation capabilities compared to the current method, and (4) demonstrate
the pre-clinical efficacy of the resulting islets for diabetes reversal using a mouse model. This Phase II
project will generate significant data and know-how for (1) transitioning to manufacturing, (2) obtaining
regulatory approval, and (3) product commercialization. The investigator team includes medical device
experts, islet biologists, engineers, and medical doctors who specialize in clinical islet manufacturing and
transplantation. The success of this project will result in the commercialization of an essential tool that
will not only make single-donor islet transplantation highly effective, affordable, and available, but also
accelerate a wide range of diabetes research―thereby benefiting the many patients around the world
who suffer from diabetes.",  ,,,,LOTIEN R HUANG,,(781) 850-5854,rhu@cgscientific.com,,  ,

neurodegenerative and systemic diseases. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is its most important modality, but also
its most problematic in terms of interoperability, storage and unified analyses. Much of this is to do with incompatible
instruments and data formats. Rapid advances in radiology resulted from the DICOM standardization of image data,
facilitating more collaborative work, better data insight, device independence and innovative developments that today
have spawned multiple independent vendors offering processing and archival solutions. For OCT, no such solution exists
and, as a direct result, despite being the standard of care, the clinical data remains under-utilized and the research
fragmented. Open formats reduce overall costs and can ultimately lead to better patient outcomes.
This project will establish the first, commercial grade, cloud-based, truly vendor neutral, DICOM compliant, image and
information storage and processing platform for ophthalmic OCT. The proposed system will bring the functionality,
interoperability, and innovation of radiology to ophthalmology. The project has the following clear and achievable
milestones: 1) Develop Nebula, a cloud-based, DICOM-compliant, image storage and archive platform. This will be built
with security as the primary consideration and will natively support patient management systems. 2) Add a web-based
analysis front-end to Nebula optimized for clinical ophthalmic workflows. 3) Build on our Phase I award, and implement,
validate and release AI-based AMD prognostics, OCT-angiography analytics and retinal fluid quantification software. 4)
Apply for regulatory approval for both Nebula’s picture archiving and communications (PACS) for ophthalmology and the
fluid quantification module. This will allow for clinical use of the system and serve as a platform for a wide variety of
ophthalmic and neurologic research.
We have received significant interest in the proposed work from researchers, ophthalmologists, and optometrists. And,
toward these ends, we have assembled a team of experts to manage, implement, validate, and release this software. That

In ENZ materials, large NLO effects, particularly in the infrared, have been demonstrated at much lower optical fluxes than have been shown in traditional NLO materials. The effect has been linked to the unique electric field concentration that occurs in ENZ materials near their zero permittivity frequency. In addition to producing extraordinary NLO effects, many groups have demonstrated that the property change is an ultrafast (fs) phenomena. These shared properties, ultrafast response and low threshold for NLO change, lend themselves to use in optical limiting applications, where ultrashort pulsed lasers are becoming an evermore concerning threat. During a recent Phase 1 feasibility study, Third Floor Materials demonstrated that the NLO effect in ENZ materials designed to operate in the MWIR, could be effectively leveraged by combining them with optical antenna structures. The antenna structure allows coupling to the ENZ mode from free-space and concentrates electric field intensity within the ENZ material further augmenting the NLO effect. Some of these hybrid meta-material/ENZ structures showed better than 2 orders of magnitude limiting at a 3 µm wavelength. To extend the usefulness of the hybrid antenna/ENZ approach, Third Floor Materials will pursue two principle objectives in the Phase 2 follow on program; an effort to broaden the response of the ENZ limiting structure across the entire MWIR (3-5 µm) and a parallel thrust designed to increase ‘off-state’ transmission. Similar to the Phase 1 study, our team will use real, measured ENZ material properties to develop a NLO FDTD model of an ENZ limiting system – and build a prototype for Army AvMC evaluation. We believe that the proposed approach will significantly expand Army understanding of ENZ materials and providing a compelling early use case in the form of an ultra-fast optical limiting solution.",Michael  Scalora,Physicist,(256) 842-2140,michael.scalora.civ@mail.mil,Christopher  Shelton,,(503) 740-7565,ctshelto@thirdfloormaterials.com,,  ,

A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become one of the greatest challenges of the modern world and has
caused a pandemic with millions of infected people and hundreds of thousands of deaths around the globe.
Transmissions occur through respiratory droplets, as well as through contaminated hands and environmental
surfaces. Therefore, cleaning and disinfection of potentially contaminated surfaces becomes one of the most
important measures in prevention of coronavirus transmission, along with social distancing and hand hygiene.
Current CDC guidelines for preventing transmission of coronavirus specifically recommend cleaning and
disinfection of frequently touched surfaces.
The use of commercially available disinfectants significantly reduces microbial counts on environmental surfaces
for only up to 4 hours after treatment. An alcohol-based disinfectant with a compound capable of forming a
durable but removable biocidal film could combine the advantages of both approaches described above. It would
combine high short-term efficacy due to the presence of alcohol and prevent microbial re-contamination due to
the long-lasting efficacy of the film, while requiring less frequent applications.
VRM Labs has recently developed such disinfectant, which contains 3 wt. % chitosan and 60 % wt. ethanol.
Chitosan is obtained from crustacean shells and its antimicrobial and antiviral efficacy is well-established.
However, it has not been used in surface disinfectants because of high viscosity of its aqueous solutions and
long drying times required to form a continuous film. Our proposed formulation has low viscosity, outstanding
film-forming properties and drying time similar to that for currently used disinfectants. In preliminary studies, door
handles treated by this novel formulation prevented microbial growth for up to 48 hours after treatment.
The goal of this Phase I study is to create an optimized prototype of chitosan-based disinfectant and to test its
bactericidal and viricidal performance in a limited-scale study in a healthcare setting. In Aim I, we will characterize
film formation properties, including film thickness, film durability, abrasion resistance, and film drying times for
formulations with different chitosan and ethanol concentrations. We will also evaluate in vitro antimicrobial and
antiviral efficacy of these chitosan-based coatings with the most common pathogens involved known to be a
source of infection on environmental surfaces, and with a surrogate coronavirus to mimic antiviral action against
COVID-19. In Aim II, we will use the optimized formulation developed in Aim I to coat several designated elevator
buttons, door handles, and bed rails in a medical facility (Greenville Memorial Hospital in South Carolina). We
will then collect environmental swabs from these coated surfaces on a regular basis and compare the microbial
and viral counts to those obtained from similar surfaces treated according to the current hospital protocol. These
experiments will help to determine the efficacy time window for the coating.Project Narrative
Currently used surface disinfectants tend to provide high-level activity over a relatively short
period of time, typically less than 4 hours. A long-acting topical treatment of environmental
surfaces would save invaluable resources such as cleansing agents and worker time and
effectively reduce disease transmission. We developed a novel film-forming disinfectant that
contains ~3 wt. % of chitosan and ~60 wt. % of ethanol. Upon application to a surface, it forms a
durable chitosan film, which in preliminary experiments was resistant to rubbing by hand and
showed biocidal properties for at least 48 hours. Chitosan is a well-established antimicrobial,
antiviral, and antifungal agent, but has not been used in surface disinfectants because of high
viscosity of its aqueous formulations and long drying times. We were able to overcome these
problems by making a formulation with 60% ethanol. Our formulation is very thin and sprayable,
and it shows excellent film-forming properties and fast drying times similar to those of currently
used products. Therefore, it is expected to provide a longer and higher quality protection of
environmental surfaces while requiring less frequent applications.",  ,,,,ALEXEY A VERTEGEL,,(864) 656-2424,vertege@clemson.edu,CLEMSON UNIVERSITY,  ,

While methods like SELEX can test many sequences simultaneously (~10^15), they often fail to produce usable aptamers.  Computational approaches have also shown promise for identifying aptamers, but the cost of simulation makes “brute force” searches infeasible.  Oceanit overcomes this issue by using in vitro data to power artificial intelligence that in turn is used to improve the SELEX process and outcomes.",Jiangying N Zhou,program manager,(703) 526-2797,jiangying.zhou@darpa.mil,Christopher  Sullivan,,(808) 256-7146,csullivan@oceanit.com,,  ,

The US Army has programs that require on-demand, primary power supplies in very restrictive environments.  These power supplies must be capable of supplying voltages as high as 60 to 70 kV.  The energy outputs must be 5 joules or more.  The active time for this power supply is ≤10 ms for increased reliability and circuit compatibility.  Mission requirements require that the power supply must be quiescent and stable under most environments.  When activated, the lead time needs to be ≤10 us.  Mission size restrictions suggest a total geometry volume of ≈25 in3.  Therefore, the Army is seeking prime power supply designs appropriate for several classes of directed-energy munitions.  While multi-use power supplies are desirable, a single-shot power supply design will satisfy all requirements of the solicitation. From the answers to questions to the sponsor, we know that the load for this power supply is a capacitor.  Given the required energy of 5 J, the size of this capacitor is ~2 nF, if the charge voltage is 70 kV.  Since a single-use power supply is acceptable, one can then consider using an explosive-driven power supply.  With the volume restriction, a Flux Compression Generator (FCG) is ruled out for two reasons.  First, an FCG is not, of itself, a prime power source, and second, including the prime power for a small capacitor with a needed volume for the FCG would simply be too large to fit the volume requirement.  Another possibility would be a FerroMagnetic Generator.  While an FMG can certainly be used as prime power, the energy available from the FMG is too small to satisfy the solicitation requirement without amplification, and the FMG volume will likely be about the stated volume – without room for an amplifier stage.  Additionally, FMGs are typically considered current sources, with associated lower impedances.  Finally, a FerroElectric Generator (FEG) should supply the electrical requirements, but only if the basic FEG is redesigned to more efficiently use the ferroelectric material for charge extraction at higher voltage, while avoiding generator breakdown – historically a limiting factor for energy delivery.  Further, an FEG can be designed to fit into the volume specified.",Martin H Yuen,,(973) 724-9097,martin.h.yuen.civ@mail.mil,Bruce  Freeman,,(505) 414-1964,bruce.freeman@iappsci.com,,  ,

In order to realize these potential throughput gains the receiver must be able to tolerate the resulting adjacent channel interference (ACI) caused by partially overlapping channels.  While ACI mitigation is similar to generalized interference mitigation for Anti-Jam resilience, there are unique challenges and opportunities present which must be addressed properly to yield an optimal solution. To this end, Pareto Frontier proposes to enhance and extend its Omni-Spatial-Interference-Removal-Integrated-System (OSIRIS); a modular and scalable STAP engine that is able to fully exploit available degrees of freedom to provide maximum interference mitigation coverage under a wide range of environments.  The augmented solution will incorporate key elements specifically addressing mitigation of dynamic interference caused by neighboring channel pulses without impacting sensitivity or Anti-Jam capability of the baseline solution rendering the novel Adaptive Capacity Enhancing System With Interference Cancellation Leveraging Duality (ACES WILD), yielding a projected capacity gain of over 100% the baseline system. As part of the Phase 1 effort, Pareto Frontier will establish under the baseline task a comprehensive Matlab model of the solution and complete an FPGA processing architecture to facilitate projection of required FPGA resources. The solution will be further tailored to best fit within what is available on the MIDS platform hardware. Pareto Frontier will work extensively with its industry partner to ensure successful positioning for a Phase II transition and achievement of a TRL 6 demonstration. Transition preparation work will include detailed technical planning and design to properly embed the solution within relevant MIDS terminal hardware and logistical program planning to organize the work-flow involved in terminal design implementation, lab integration/test and final demonstration. Option activities will further mitigate hardware transition risk via completion of fixed-point algorithm conversion and proof-of-concept implementation on surrogate hardware along with extended MIDS integration risk mitigation.",Carlos N Alvarado,MIDS Technology Officer,(619) 524-1582,carlos.alvarado@navy.mil,Jonathan  Beaudeau,,(978) 496-5513,jonathan@pareto-frontier.com,,  ,

Time on the range could be used more effectively, resulting in greater overall training and readiness benefit, if aviators arrived, in aggregate, better prepared for the specific exercises being planned, and if the instructors and aviators planning the event better understood the capabilities and limitations of individual units before their arrival. This effort proposes to use simulation-based training, in conjunction with individualized, dynamic tailoring of the simulation, to identify and to remediate skill gaps. We propose to produce a system that provides simulation exercises designed to assess skill and readiness, diagnose potential reasons for skills gaps, and recommend additional training/practice scenarios targeted not just to skill gaps but to the underlying reasons or causes for deficits. Training and remediation scenarios such as the ones envisioned here are today manually created. Manual creation has the benefit of applying direct, expert knowledge to the needs. However, manual scenario creation results in lags between the observation of a need and delivery of  targeted scenarios for those needs and requires high-demand subject-matter experts. This effort will pursue automated scenario generation within the context of readiness assessment and evaluate the extent to which scenario construction methods are sufficiently mature and capable to construct effective and targeted exercises for readiness assessment and remediation.",Jennifer N Pagan,Technical Point of Contact,(407) 380-8130,jennifer.pagan1@navy.mil,Robert  Wray,,(919) 967-5079,wray@soartech.com,,  ,

The scale features key innovations that revolutionized handling qualities testing including the decision tree that guides pilots to the handling qualities level and the individual ratings that are a function of aircraft characteristics and pilot compensation. For the decades that followed, researchers have sought to correlate pilot compensation – as well as physical and mental workload – with the assigned rating, but a quantitative correlation between workload and handling qualities ratings remains elusive. In recent years, new measurement devices have been developed that together with software processing tools can provide accurate measures of psychophysiological measures including cognitive workload, distraction, and engagement based on electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) measures (i.e., brain waves and heart rate variability) and others. Pilot compensation is also a function of task performance that reflects aircraft characteristics and inceptor activity that reflects upon physical workload.

Phosphatidylserine (PS) is emerging as an attractive immunotherapeutic target in the light of mounting evidence
highlighting its causal link to immune suppression. We have established that exosomes derived from melanoma
and ovarian tumor microenvironments express PS on their surfaces and suppress multiple activation endpoints
of T cells triggered through the T cell receptor. Studies have also shown that expression of PS on the surface of
many non-apoptotic cancer cells lead to immunosuppression. Recent clinical studies in melanoma patients
demonstrated that exosomes that are released from patient tumors suppress T cell tumor killing and contribute
to tumor progression. We have designed and synthesized a new compound, Zn-DPA)6-DP-15K (ExoBlock) that
binds to phosphatidylserine with high avidity. ExoBlock was shown to consistently and significantly block the
immune suppressive activity of exosomes derived from melanoma and ovarian tumor microenvironments in vitro.
Based upon these findings, we predicted that ExoBlock would enhance the killing of tumor cells by T cells in
tumor xenografts due to its binding to PS on the exosomes, tumor and apoptotic cells, representing a multi-
pronged approach. We tested this prediction using two different human tumor xenograft models: a) the previously
validated in-house developed omental tumor xenograft (OTX) model established using patient-derived ovarian
tumors, and b) the recently developed and validated Xenomimetic mouse (X-mouse) model that allows us to
quantify and establish the efficacy of multiple T cell-stimulating immune-based therapies pre-clinically. This
model uses melanoma patient-derived tumor-specific T cells that are adoptively transferred into immunodeficient
mice bearing melanoma xenografts expressing tumor neo-antigens recognized by the T cells. The therapeutic
efficacy of ExoBlock was next established by significantly enhancing tumor suppression in both the OTX and X-
mouse models, and was found to be comparable to anti-PD-1 therapy in X-mouse model. Together, these results
have laid the foundation and rationale for our work proposed in the Phase I application. Additional toxicity and
pharmacokinetic (PK) studies are proposed for ExoBlock in Aim 1. The PK studies will help to determine the
optimal dose, schedule and delivery method of ExoBlock that will be tested in aim 2. In Aim 2 ExoBlock will be
tested in vivo for its therapeutic efficacy in omental tumor xenograft (OTX) model consisting of patient-derived
ovarian tumor and syngeneic mouse melanoma model with B16-F10 tumor. Our rationale for using both a human
and mouse tumor model is discussed in the Approach. The results of this Phase 1 study will lay the foundation
for a more extensive study in a future phase 2 study that will lead to an IND and clinical trial of ExoBlock.Narrative
We have identified small (virus sized) extracellular vesicles, called exosomes present in human
ovarian and melanoma tumor microenvironments that inhibit the ability of tumor specific T cells to
kill tumor cells. We have identified with in vitro studies phosphatidylserine (PS) binding drug
named ExoBlock that block the immune suppressive vesicles. Using animal models, we will test
with in vivo studies the therapeutic efficacy of ExoBlock to enhance tumor killing by T cells. Our
goal, using improved animal models for testing and more reliable measures to quantify changes
in tumor burdens, is to provide convincing pre-clinical data to support a rationale for clinical trials
with ovarian cancer patients and melanoma cancer patients.",  ,,,,RICHARD B BANKERT,,(716) 812-5363,rbankert@buffalo.edu,,  ,

To address this need Ibeos performed preliminary development of a radiation-tolerant software-based processing solution for machine-vision algorithms during the SBIR Phase I period of performance. Its combination of >1 TFLOPS throughput, 15 in3 volume, 35W maximum power, and harsh environment compatibility enable the real-time local processing. The work performed under this program leveraged Ibeos’ first generation EDGE space payload processor, which utilizes a commercial Nvidia TK1 as the primary processing engine. This proposal describes Ibeos’ efforts under an MDA Phase I SBIR to develop a next generation EDGE processing unit (EDGE-2), and its proposed work for a Phase II SBIR to continue this development. The goal of Phase I was to develop an early architecture for a space processor that could host machine vision computer algorithms. Specifically, for the Phase I program, Ibeos focused on: early requirements development; selection of primary processor for the EDGE-2; initial radiation testing of selected processor at the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory; Initial radiation analysis of selected processor; early architecture design of space processor board with radiation mitigation hardware and software. For the Phase II program, Ibeos will complete an EDGE-2 prototype hardware design. This prototype will be used for full radiation performance characterization. In addition, a unit will be delivered to the government customer to allow for benchtop testing against government furnished sample imagery and processing algorithms. Other payload computer performance will be assessed and the results compared to quantify the performance benefits of the Ibeos solution. A test plan will be delivered with the hardware, and will include the figures of merit to assess overall performance. An additional Phase II objective is to obtain early flight heritage of the processor. Currently, an early flight opportunity may exist with the DARPA customer. Ibeos has been in contact with program managers in DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office (TTO) over the past few years given the organization’s interest in on-board edge processing for satellites. If an early flight opportunity for the EDGE-2 exists through a DARPA cubesat program, Ibeos is prepared to support. By the end of the Phase II program, Ibeos will have completed full design of a prototype payload processor, and its performance will have been validated using government furnished data. The EDGE-2 will have reached a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, with key components verified to a TRL 8 (including full radiation characterization of all key components). These results will serve as an important base for a Phase III program. At this time, a majority of the design work for a full flight unit will be complete. By the end of Phase II, the EDGE-2 will be ready to bring to market. Approved for Public Release | 20-MDA-10643 (3 Dec 20)",MDA S PMO,,(256) 955-2020,sbirsttr@mda.mil,J.

Huanglongbing disease (""HLB"") has killed millions of citrus trees and reduced average yieldin Florida by 33% costing the citrus industry billions in lost revenue.CRISPR is the most powerful tool for rapid breeding of new HLB-resistant citrus trees buthas to be preceded by identifying specific gene-editing targets. The identification of target genes hasbeen challenging because of poor understanding of the HLB pathogenesis mechanism and technicallimitations of HLB-citrus protein-interaction screening methods. A powerful new tool to addressthese limitations is TurboID an engineered biotin ligase that can label its proximal proteins when it isexpressed in cells.The proposed project addresses this opportunity by â€‹employing TurboID-mediated proximitylabeling to identify citrus proteins that interact with â€‹effector proteins that are critical for HLBbacterial infection.We willthen use the discovered proteins as gene-editing targets for â€‹CRISPR precisionbreeding â€‹to develop citrus varieties that disrupt the effector-citrus interactions leading to geneticresistance to HLB.To that end we will perform two objectives. The first objective is generating effector-TurboIDexpressing transgenic citrus plants. We will use HLB bacterium Sec-dependent effector (""SDE"")proteins proven to cause HLB-disease symptoms including SDE1 and SDE15.The second objective is identifying SDE-interacting citrus proteins by TurboID coupled withmass spectrometry. We will produce a high-confidence list of SDE-interacting citrus proteins throughdata analysis.We anticipate this project will identify gene-editing targets that we will then use to developnon-GMO HLB-resistant citrus trees that will be sold through citrus nurseries to citrus growers.",  ,,,,Chan Ho  Park,,(650) 438-0648,chanho@soilcea.com,,  ,

Severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), caused by disease, aging, ototoxicity,
head trauma and heredity, affects about 60 million worldwide, and is expected to reach around
100 million by 2050. This disability leads to a significantly lowered quality of life and a large
economic burden, estimated to be around $750 billion worldwide, coming from health sector
costs, educational support, and loss of workplace productivity. For this population, amplification
with even the most sophisticated hearing aids is usually ineffective, and restorative biological
therapies are years away. A cochlear implant is currently the only available route for restoring
‘adequate’ functionality. Only 600,000 implants have been done worldwide till 2019, and about
50,000 devices are being sold annually. This large discrepancy between those that can benefit
and those that actually get the implant is driven partly by their cost, availability and the lack of
trained surgeons and facilities. However, there are several limitations in the current devices that
contribute to very low adoption: (a) The highly visible unit attached to the skull outside the
mastoid bone, connected by a cable to the sound processor and rechargeable battery placed
behind the ears, makes the disability very obvious, and creates an unacceptable social stigma
for many patients, causing them to refuse this option; (b) Sound filtering by the auricle and
auditory canal is bypassed because of the external microphone, introducing unnatural cues; (c)
The device typically must be taken off during showering or swimming (although a few water-
resistant versions are now available), and during sleeping, increasing the likelihood of damage,
misplacement, or the ability to hear in these situations; (d) Having an external magnet that
couples and aligns the internal and external components can lead to skin breakdown and
implant extrusion; (e) The large footprint and placement leaves open the risk for device
migration requiring revision surgery. A fully internal cochlear implant (FICI), that does not have
any behind the ear components, would address this large unmet medical need.
There are no FICIs currently approved by the FDA. The lack of a self-contained power supply is
a key roadblock preventing realization of all FICIs. Through innovations in circuit design and
signal processing, collaborating groups at Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Massachusetts
Institute of Technology have developed, tested and patented a low power (1 mW) system-on-a-
chip (SoC) for a FICI, a critical advance. Current rechargeable batteries have organic liquid
electrolytes making them unsafe for this application. With SBIR Phase I funding, Audiance, Inc.
has shown proof of concept of an all-solid single-stack cell that is the building block for a battery
that meets the electrochemical, safety and footprint requirements for a FICI. The focus of this
SBIR Phase II project is to build a multi-stack wirelessly rechargeable battery and integrate it
with a battery management system that senses the state of health of the battery and controls
the charge profile to provide timely charging and maximum battery life. The all-solid LIB will
remove a critical roadblock for the development of a FICI, and thus open up an opportunity to
help millions of patients around the world with severe to profound SNHL. The learning from the
design and fabrication of this battery will allow Audiance to customize batteries for a range of
other active implantable medical devices.",  ,,,,MICHAEL  MOLINSKI,,(401) 644-5686,mmolinski@audiance-inc.com,,  ,

As these enterprises are closely watched by the seafoodcommunity they face numerous challenges off-flavors are consistently ranked among top issuesfacing the RAS industry.Off-flavors are caused mainly by geosmin (GSM) and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) whichaccumulate in edible tissues and confer highly undesirable muddy/musty taste. Currently fishare purged to remove GSM/MIB - implying significant increases in OpEx doubled with weightand quality loss.Past trials repeatedly showed that feeds containing our single-cell flour (KBM) reduced the GSMand MIB fillet contents in three species. Moreover these effects were seen while all fish sharedthe same water and the fillet and water GSM/MIB levels were poorly correlated. Therefore wehypothesize that GSM/MIB are primarily produced by the fish gut microbiome and absorbedthough enterocytes.We intend to use such feeds in a finishing diet approach. The proposed trial would see market-
size Atlantic salmon fed a control or a KBM-containing feed for 8 weeks. At the 4- and 8-weektimepoint fish will be sampled for fillet for measurement of GSM and MIB. The fish fish tankand biofilter will be sampled for microbiome evaluation.The results will provide critical information on the mitigation methods of off-flavors in RASand our path to commercialization with major feed manufacturers.

This work addresses warfighter concerns raised in the area of satellite communications and radar, where burst-produced ionospheric disturbances can cause scintillation of a propagating signal. The signal can experience fading of amplitude and phase, as well as rapid variation in time-of-arrival and angle-of-arrival. Without mitigation, these disturbances can cause increased error rate and degraded communications and sensor performance. All these propagation channel disturbances are mathematically described by the channel impulse response function (CIRF). The CIRF can vary in time for a particular propagation channel due to movement of the ionization or movement of the transmitter or receiver which causes motion of the propagation path with respect to the ionization. The objective of this work is to determine, in real time, the time-varying ionospheric transfer function (or channel filter) (the transfer function is the Fourier transform of the CIRF). In the proposed work, the transfer function is used to obtain the “matched channel filter (MCF).” The MCF can be applied to the received signal to precisely compensate for the effects of the disturbance. Determination of the MCF is thus a first step towards full mitigation of SATCOM link disturbances. Under this work, we will also investigate the accuracy of our processing to determine the MCF, develop and test methods to measure the channel parameters in real time, and perform a sensitivity study to determine channel parameter measurement accuracy.",Juan N Cuadrado,TPOC,(571) 616-5462,juan.a.cuadrado.civ@mail.mil,Dennis  Knepp,,(831) 582-4906,dennis.knepp@nwra.com,,  ,

Past work has identified various general mechanisms by which the detonation of conventional explosives produces electric and electromagnetic phenomena. These mechanisms include early time ionization, case breakup, piezoelectric effects, lightning in the debris cloud, seismo-electric effects, and movement of charge within porous earth materials. These phenomena are related to seismo-electric exploration as well as the field of magnetotellurics. Using transient electric field measurements as a test diagnostics tool is attractive because 1) a major advantage of electric methods compared to mechanical methods is that they eliminate the ambiguity that often exists for mechanical signals regarding the travel path and/or propagation velocity (since electric signals propagate at the speed of light, the travel time is insignificant), and 2) valuable data can be collected and analyzed in future tests if it can be determined how the electric field measurements can be related to phenomena of interest. Triton proposes to expand on its e-field measurement capabilities to capture blast propagation data (to include: velocity, intensity and duration). In Phase I, Triton will identify the most important mechanisms that generate transient electric fields during explosive tests, and the signal types and characteristics expected from such mechanisms. Triton’s arguments will be testable and support using methods such as: theoretical derivations, modeling, previous studies, and simple experiments (if cost feasible). Triton’s best method or methods to collect transient electric field measurements during explosive tests will be proposed.

In the radiological response community, with the exception of a limited number of large-scale
exercises, there is a gap in technology that hinders hands-on survey training. Even when there
is an available exercise, the compressed time sequence prevents realistic practice for some
players, particularly field survey teams. The goal of this Phase I project is to initiate efforts to
narrow this gap by creating a prototype of a computer game-based framework, RadTeamSim -
Route, that in conjunction with common radiological dose modeling (used to create exercise
scenarios around the United States), provides members of survey team adequate opportunities
to improve their knowledge and make critical decisions in a dynamic, scientifically accurate
environment. The architecture of the RadTeamSim - Route will provide ample opportunities for
repeated practice that incorporates real time, personal, and unequivocal feedback – all
necessary ingredients for developing robust expertise. In turn, making such framework
available, will significantly increase the number of individuals able to access realistic training to
practice critical radiological field survey monitoring skills through a game-based training option
that does not currently exist for this audience.
The primary goal of this project is to create a new training platform by blending existing dose
modeling methods with gaming software. This new platform would support improved radiological
emergency response preparedness by creating realistic radiation incident scenarios to enable
responders to improve their field survey and health and safety awareness skills.
Phase I Objectives Include:· Develop a prototype/proof of concept for a realistic field survey team training game withinputs from radiological modeling software· Validate the values in the simulation game against the modeling software outputs toensure proper survey data and location alignment between the data· Survey the community for feedback on the usability of the simulation game as trainingdelivery and interest in future enhancements or other types of realistic game-basedtraining that would be ideal for radiological emergency response
Long Term/Future Phase Objectives Include:· Expanding into additional critical training areas, such as field team sampling of water,soil, and vegetation.· Leveraging Virtual Reality platforms for all training options.Project Narrative
Radiological emergency response is an area in which the risk is high for responders. Field team
members must traverse through contaminated regions with limited training. This project will result in
a video game environment that will improve training and health and safety of team members.",  ,,,,WENDY  RENNO,,(702) 509-9956,info@radiationemergencyservices.com,,  ,

Our VehChain provides a distributed and decentralized message validation scheme for intra-vehicle communication networks. Distributed message validation at each node secures the CAN bus through MAC, encryption, and key generation reminiscent of the Blockchain technology. Each cryptographic key is tied to the CAN frame's identifier, hash (plain-text payload), and hash (previous key).

The ZestBiomission is aligned with USDA NIFA priorities of developing new processes formanufacturing biobased chemicals from US agricultural resources. The United States isuniquely positioned as a world leader in fruit and vegetable processing including sugarproduction from sugar beets (37 million tons/yr) and citrus juicing (3 million tons/yr).However the peel and pulp byproducts from processing lack value-adding technologies.The proposed research aims to develop a value-adding in vitro enzymatic conversiontechnology for the conversion of pectic monosaccharides into specialty chemicals. Thisenzymatic strategy can enable rapid bioprocessing with reduced handling and capexrequirements compared to conventional approaches such as chemical synthesis orfermentation. The first chemical product from this bioprocessing technology can beformulated as a chelant for water treatment applications. This formulation exhibitssuperior calcium and heavy metal binding compared to established biobased chelants.Thus it satisfies the growing demand for sustainable and high-performing chemicals. Theoverall project goal is to engineer improved enzymatic activity for the in vitromanufacturing process. First we propose screening of a variety of natural enzymes andtheir homologs for activity in pectin hydrolysate. Second we propose mutagenesis of theenzyme sequence and identifying high activity mutants using a microbial growth selection.The anticipated results from this work plan are improvements in enzyme activity sufficientfor commercially viable enzymatic bioprocessing. Implementation of thisbiomanufacturing process can increase overall crop revenue. This offers reduced volatilityin crop value financial sustainability for farmers and construction of rural-locatedfermentation facilities to create high paying technical jobs. Furthermore by using existingcrop byproducts our products will have a lower carbon footprint compared to competingchemicals made from petroleum or purified sugar.1,  ,,,,Luke  Latimer,,(303) 328-7284,latimer@zestbio.com,,  ,

Wound infection is usually acquired in the hospital setting and is a significant source of morbidity and mortality in military healthcare. Empiric antibiotic treatment although previously preferred is now problematic due to the global rise in MDR isolates. With few new antibiotic solutions, new treatment strategies are needed. Therapeutic phage is an ideal alternative treatment because of their inherent bacterial specificity. Chronic bacterial infections are often accompanied with biofilm formations and many MDR organisms grow in biofilms possibly defeating phages isolated with planktonic bacteria. For phage therapy to be effective, it is necessary to identify phages capable of productively infecting a given biofilm bacterium. Although, assays that detect biofilm-disrupting agents have been developed, this technology has not been translated to searching for phage with antibiofilm activity. This proposal, by Guild BioSciences and The Ohio State University, will address this need with the development of a novel rapid high-throughput bead biofilm (HTBB) phage screening system that selects phages capable of disrupting biofilms. It will also be simple, inexpensive, and rapid antibiofilm phage hunting device (AB-PHD); thus, it will be a major advancement compared to existing traditional phage hunting. The critical novelty is a species-independent signaling component (SISC) based on fluorescent beads (fBs) that will be incorporated into biofilms during their initiation. If test phage/environmental phage lysates degrade biofilms, the SISC will be released to the supernatant and the resulting fluorescent signal will be measured. A bead-based biofilm assay established by our research institution collaborator Dr. Daniel Wozniak, will be the starting point for assay design. This proposal will select and develop a fluorescent bead based system using a Pseudomonas aeruginosa model system through three Technical Objectives: Develop a high throughput bead biofilm (HTBB) assay for antibiofilm phage screening. The test tube assay will be converted into a 96-well plate assay and optimized for detecting antibiofilm phage. 1. Develop and optimize the species-independent signaling component (SISC). Two classes of fBs will be initially evaluated for incorporation into biofilms, incidental uptake by bacteria, and release due to antibiofilm activity of first enzymes and then model phages. 2. Assess the performance of the combined SISC-HTBB system. The HTBB assay from TO1 and the SISC from TO2 will be combined, optimized and tested using model phage and environmental phage lysates. The use of biofilm beads for propagating/amplifying phage will be tested as well.",MAJ Damon  Ellison,,,damon.w.ellison.mil@mail.mil,Augustine  DiNovo,,(843) 573-0095,gdinovo@guildbiosciences.com,The Ohio State University,Daniel  Wozniak,(614) 292-4315

especially after cancer chemotherapy and transplant. Recently, we have witnessed
increased cases of influenza-associated aspergillosis and COVID-19-associated
aspergillosis, complicating effective treatment in those critically ill with viral infections.
Outcomes are poor in part because we lack sensitive diagnostic tests that are easy to
use during high-risk periods. During our efforts to develop easier diagnostic tests, we
discovered that fungal galactofuranose (galf)– containing antigens are excreted in urine
of infected animals and people, using novel monoclonal antibodies. We engineered a
prototype enzyme immunoassay called MycoMEIA, and performance was tested using
urine samples obtained from patients with suspected and confirmed IA. Results showed
andgt;80% sensitivity and specificity, meeting predefined metrics for clinical study. As part of
this proposal, this design-locked assay will move into clinical study, in three clinical
microbiology laboratories to support FDA 510k application. Additional work is proposed to
understand how the urine assay can be optimized to detect aspergillosis in non-hematology
patients at risk, including ICU patients with COVID-19. Success in meeting the milestones
described will lead to commercial availability of the first rapid, easy to use urine diagnostic
assay for this important fungal infection, with potential to reduce disease prevalence and
improve outcomes.Invasive aspergillosis is a fungal disease caused by the inhalation of fungal
spores that are present in our environment. People with weakened immune
systems caused by cancer, lung diseases and other conditions are at a high
risk of developing pneumonia caused by these environmental organisms.
Fungal spores can grow within the lung rather quickly resulting in invasive
disease, which has a high percentage of deaths. We have developed a rapid,
easy to use urine test to detect the fungus in the body, which will be useful to
prevent infection and to start appropriate medications for therapy.",  ,,,,KIEREN A MARR,,(443) 742-0250,kierenmarr@mycomedtechnologies.com,,  ,

Over 700000 human livescould be saved annually by preventing such vector bites. The application of insect repellentsdirectly on the skin or in the form of impregnated textile has long been the primary traditionaldefense against this threat. As of now synthetic repellents such as DEET or Permethrin arepreferred over common natural repellents due to the formers' effectiveness and durability despitetheir numerous health carcinogenic and environmental warnings.Recently scientists from the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) discovered that biobasedmedium-chain fatty acids derived from coconut oil have shown excellent repellent activity against abroad array of blood-sucking arthropods including biting flies ticks bed bugs and mosquitoes.These fatty acids were found to be even better repellents than DEET and Permethrin.With this project InsectaPel working with ARS aims to develop formulations and applicationmethodologies to incorporate new biobased repellents into textile products. The approach is basedon textile coating technology well established by the InsectaPel team. It is expected that theproposed research will result in the development of new safer insect-repelling textile coatingscompetitive to existing products. A significant fraction of synthetic repellents currently used intextiles can be potentially replaced with agriculturally derived alternatives. The proposed researchwill benefit US agriculture by driving additional demand for coconut triglycerides and creatingvaluable end products.,  ,,,,Dawn  Clarke,,(508) 728-4229,dawn@insectapel.com,,  ,

infections (PJI). UDEPs kill bacteria through activation of the ClpP protease, causing cells to self-digest. This unique
activating mechanism allows UDEPs to kill biofilms and non-growing persister cells, which are prevalent in PJI and
explain why current antibiotics are largely ineffective. Current therapies involve weeks to months of antibiotic
treatment, debridement surgeries, and medical device replacement. UDEPs have the potential to minimize surgical
interventions due to PJI and improve patient care. PJI are primarily caused by the Gram-positive pathogens
Staphylococcus aureus and epidermidis and the UDEPs are potently active against these pathogens, including multi-drug
resistant strains. A recent advance in our UDEP medical chemistry program yielded a new compound which has
improved safety, solubility, and bone penetration compared to first generation UDEPs. A preliminary study found that
the compound was effective in a K-wire femur medullary canal implant model of PJI, which is known to be difficult to
treat. In this project, we will evaluate if the compound is an acceptable pre-clinical candidate for PJI by testing it in a
series of in vitro and in vivo studies focused on this indication. Specifically, the aims are to 1) scale up the compound; 2)
determine the microbiological and biofilm killing effect against the main pathogens isolated from PJI; and 3) determine

A recent surveillance study in Iraq found that enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) 23% and enteroaggregative E. Coli (12.5%) were the most common pathogens to cause gastrointestinal tract (GI) infections. Now many pathogens pose high resistance in multidrug or antibiotics. These kinds of bacterial virulence and their effect on cellular dynamics and cognition are essential to study in the human model to determine emerging pathogens with potential future treatment. Toward the solution, NeyroblastGX LLC (NGL), proposed to develop “hOPSense”, a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived 3D GI tract organoid (GIO) system compatible to high content electroconductance microfluidics-based sensing array for detecting physiologically relevant pathogen response. In our study, we have selected GI tract since various military surveys revealed that diarrhea is the most frequent complaint in deployed military personnel from the United States (U.S). In this project, NGL will generate GIO from hPSC derived 3D spheroid culture. Our in-house 3D spheroids are highly enriched in endodermal marker expression with self-renewal properties like a stem cell. These spheroids are highly stable and the ability to regenerate even after the freeze-thaw cycle. We will use these spheroids to generate GIO in combination within house biocompatible gel matrix plate to speed up the organoid generation process (~21 days), where traditional GIO generation takes 60 days. Thus, NGL GI organoid generation will be fast, cost-effective, and will have the ability to scale up easily. NGL also will introduce microbiome culture to these organoids to produce a fully functional GI tract system to study pathogenic versus non-pathogenic responses. To study host-pathogen interaction, NGL will treat GIO with E. coli and Salmonella, and both were reported pathogenic bacterial species in various military outbreaks. After the treatment of GIO with bacteria, we will collect organoids and run for organoid paracellular barrier function, cytokines array profile, and shotgun metagenomic for these samples. We anticipate observing correlation with intestinal disruption with increasing cytokine releasing signal and alteration of metagenomic pattern with pathogenic bacteria compared to non-pathogenic. We will also explore GIO electroconductance activity by using an electrical interface combined microfluidics chip. All these results will be quantifiable and can be able to be scaling up to using high-content microfluidics assay platform, further refining to use in Phase II to study pathogen on a large scale. Thus, NGL GIO system technology will able to replicate the physiologically relevant response of host-pathogen interaction with higher sensitivity and specificity to improve warfighter health.",Paul N Sheehan,program manager,(703) 526-2072,paul.sheehan@darpa.mil,Aynun  Begum,,(818) 357-3018,aynunbegum@live.com,,  ,

CytoAgents is developing GP1681 (beraprost-314d) to regulate the uncontrolled inflammatory response that can
result from viral infections. This inflammatory response is associated with increased disease severity, acute lung
injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death. The emergence of novel viruses with
pandemic potential poses a major threat to world health and security. In particular, the emergence of novel
coronaviruses (CoVs) of animal origin in recent decades indicates that these viruses will continue to cross
species boundaries and cause outbreaks in humans. The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, a highly pathogenic
CoV that causes lower respiratory tract infections and severe pneumonia, represents a severe public health
emergency and has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. SARS-CoV-2 has so
far infected nearly 3M individuals in 185 countries, resulting in over 200K deaths, with the greatest number of
confirmed cases in the U.S. While most individuals with COVID-19 report only mild illness, about 14% develop
severe disease requiring hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require intensive care. This has resulted
in a significant burden on healthcare systems in several countries, as well as a massive economic burden
globally. Studies have revealed that the severity of viral disease and negative health outcomes are often
associated with an overstimulated cytokine response, rather than the viral load per se. Overactivation of the
inflammatory response results in the uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines, known as
hypercytokinemia, which contributes to the destruction of lung tissue, and in severe cases, leads to ARDS,
multiorgan dysfunction, and death. GP1681 moderates hypercytokinemia and may reduce the duration and
severity of many viral diseases, including COVID-19. Evaluation in mouse models has shown notable efficacy of
GP1681 in the treatment of influenza. Knowledge of the mechanism of action of GP1681 suggests that it may
be equally effective in treating COVID-19. CytoAgents has submitted an Investigational New Drug (IND)
Application to the FDA for an influenza indication and received approval to proceed with a Phase 1 study.
Additional NIH (NIAID)-funded preclinical studies are also underway in influenza models. To assess the potential
of GP1681 for use against COVID-19, the aims of this project are 1) IND-enabling toxicology studies expanding
the initial toxicology screens, as longer treatment may be needed given the typical COVID-19 disease course;
2) Pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis in a non-human primate (NHP) model; and 3) Assessment of the efficacy of
delayed GP1681 treatment in an NHP model of COVID-19, as therapy in the clinic is typically initiated at some
time after viral infection. The outcomes of this project will prepare CytoAgents for an IND application for the use
of GP1681 in the treatment of COVID-19.",  ,,,,JODI K CRAIGO,,(412) 956-0997,jcraigo@cytoagents.com,,  ,

management of acute, post-surgical dental pain. Despite the current opioid crisis, opioid prescription following
removal of the wisdom teeth (third molar extraction) remains a common practice among dentists, due in part to
the potential for painful complications such as dry sockets. Approximately ten million patients undergo surgical
tooth extraction in the U.S. each year, many of whom are adolescents and young adults with no prior exposure
to opioid medications, and most at risk for opioid abuse or misuse. To meet this medical and societal need for
novel, non-addictive medications to manage and treat acute dental pain, we developed LBB-111. LBB-111 is a
proprietary resorbable emulsion of three anesthetic drugs that is administered, during tooth extraction, directly
to the extraction socket, where it delivers sustained, post-operative pain relief for four to seven days post-surgery.
The preliminary safety, stability, and pharmacological properties of LBB-111 were demonstrated in Phase I. The
objectives of Phase II are to complete Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies of LBB-111, including
establishing manufacturing and quality control processes (Aim 1), and in vivo toxicology studies in a beagle
animal model (Aim 2). The successful completion of the Aims of this proposal will advance LBB-111 towards
IND submission, and first in human studies. Future FDA approval and commercialization of LBB-111 will

The underwater mission environment is fraught with communication difficulties, novel scenarios, difficult perception tasks, and huge operational areas. Advanced autonomy could be the solution to all of these issues. A sufficiently trained and developed AI could break the reliance on human intervention, surface communication, and GPS localization and carry out complex missions across wide swaths of seafloor, including dark, opaque, or turbulent waters. Advanced autonomy requires advanced training, and advanced training requires simulation models that can mimic real environments to a sufficient level of size and detail that missions can be productively simulated. Against the larger backdrop of DARPA’s Angler program, which recognizes and emphasizes the need for the development of advanced autonomy, it is clear that DARPA requires a scalable and reliable way to convert its existing stores of underwater environmental data into large and detailed computational simulation models. Navatek proposes to develop this capability by creating an automatic programmatic pipeline that analyzes and characterizes raw sensor data, extracts the resulting point clouds, fuses them while reconciling their resolution and precision differences, eliminates noise and redundancy of the resulting large cloud, meshes them into continuous surfaces, and augments these surfaces with environmental detail from both the original sensor data and from relevant external data sources. Phase I will consist of a research effort, a feasibility assessment, and an establishment of the steps of the automatic pipeline from raw data to finished simulation environment. Navatek proposes to demonstrate the success and utility of its effort by creating a simulation example which directly showcases the capabilities of a so-created digital underwater environment. Navatek proposes to undertake this Phase I effort with a specific focus on computational feasibility and on lowering the time, processing power, and memory needed to create, store, and utilize such environments. The Phase II effort will expand on the results of Phase I and develop a complete, functional tool for the automatic creation of undersea simulation models. The successful completion of this effort will increase the availability of geographically, environmentally, seasonally, and spatially relevant simulation environments to support future underwater system mission planning, reconstruction, sensor development, and algorithm training.  ",Andrew N Nuss,program manager,(703) 526-2727,andrew.nuss@darpa.mil,Nathaniel  Cope,,(410) 441-6590,ncope@navatekllc.com,,  ,

Hence the ability toaccurately collect and analyze data in order to be predictive is seen as the ""holy grail"" of poultryproduction efficiency poultry health and food safety. From an innovation perspective this willrequire improved and greater utilization of remote sensing in addition to optimization of variouspredictive models. As some companies start to explore Machine Learning (ML) based approaches(i.e. statistical techniques that are capable of ""learning by finding"" non-obvious associations andpatterns in the data in order to create more reliable custom accurate explanatory and predictivestatistical models) for predictive analyses there is a general lack of knowledge about which MLapproaches 'work' and how ML based results can be integrated within decision science based toolswhich highlight company expertise as opposed to data. In other words the ability to createintegrative software that stresses both novel predictive statistics and institutional knowledge wouldallow data and expert knowledge to be dovetailed and considered equally by decision makers.One hindrance to this approach is the inability to acquire accurate data. ""Garbage in garbage out""is a real problem in the analysis of ag-based data including poultry data from the farm to theprocessing plant. One paramount example is the inability to count eggs at the poultry house level(as opposed to the processing plant). Without these data at the house level counting is only doneaccurately at the processing plant which makes flock management at the house and row levelimpossible. Here we propose to develop two innovations and dovetail the technologies.1. With respect to egg production we propose to further develop our novel modular egg counterthat attaches to commercial egg conveyor belts of differing width and detects egg counts usingdifferent approaches including ultrasonic analysis infrared analysis and image analysis.2. With respect to predictive data analysis and decision sciences for layer broiler and turkeyproduction using ML based techniques we propose to test 3 ML based predictive approachesfrom historic raw data provided by various commercial poultry partners we are affiliated withincluding our first commercial client Hy-Line North America (an international layer geneticcompany). Our goal is to identify the best predictive ML based model(s) to better predictproduction economics and food safety outcomes. The analyses from the ML will be furtherleveraged by the incorporation of decision science based tools like Analytical HierarchyProcesses (AHP) that can help poultry companies quantitatively query internal experts inorder to integrate expert opinion within a company to statistical observation and cost-benefitanalysis provided by ML analysis based tools.The greatest improvements in poultry production efficiency food safety and economics will bemade via the improved accuracy of data and integration and utilization of data.

The operational significance in developing this capability is to greatly improve the probability of successful target intercept – providing better target detection, tracking and false-target discrimination than is possible with the currently existing, or even moderately upgraded, on-board sensors. Our solution to this problem is a compact, efficient, functionally-integrated coherent detection ladar subsystem that meets and exceeds the stated customer specifications and adds the capability of precision Doppler which aids in target identification and discrimination. The benefit to MDA of this development effort is the near-term availability of a sensor that can be integrated with future on-board missile sensors, can detect targets to 200 km range, can mitigate interference, can provide very-high-accuracy closing velocity (~ 1 cm/s) and fine range resolution (15 cm) and range precision (~ 1 cm), and is compatible with the harsh missile operating environment. The precision velocity measurement capability of the proposed coherent ladar significantly improves target identification and discrimination and inherently offers additional enhanced measurement modalities including range Doppler imaging. Innovations realized in this development program include the capability to provide target detection at low transmitted peak power compatible with highly-efficient all fiber transmitters, high range resolution and precision. These innovations come via the evolution of a single photon sensitive coherent detection ladar, an efficient high-power Thulium-doped, large-mode-area (LMA) fiber amplifier, wide-band transmitted signal modulation, high-stability programmable reference lasers, and compact and efficient state-of-the art integrated circuits allowing for very compact high-bandwidth signal acquisition and processing. In Phase I, Beyond Photonics (BP) performed trade studies, analysis and modeling, and developed a conceptual design of the proposed ladar. In Phase II we propose to develop a realistic ladar subsystem brass-board and demonstrate that it can achieve the above noted performance in lab and ground-based field testing.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and metapneumovirus (MPV) are the two leading viral causes of death in
infants and young children, and are major causes of respiratory illness in immunocompromised adults and the
elderly. Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine or effective therapy available for either infection. Synagis, a
monthly intramuscular injection of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) palivizumab, is the only FDA-approved
intervention given to a very small subset of high-risk infants as immunoprophylaxis. However, it is not effective
at treating RSV infections. There are no MPV treatments currently in any stage of clinical development. Thus,
for the tens of thousands of patients hospitalized for either RSV or MPV, only supportive therapy is available,
and morbidity and mortality are substantial. Interestingly, both viruses spread in the lung by shedding daughter
viruses exclusively into the airway lumen; shed viruses must then traverse airway mucus (AM) before
infecting neighboring cells, and infections remain primarily restricted to the airways with little to no systemic
viremia. We believe a virus-specific, safe, effective and topically-delivered antiviral would provide a powerful
option to address the current gap in pharmacological interventions. Mucommune is developing MM004 to meet
the urgent need for a bronchiolitis treatment, based on our “muco-trapping” mAb platform. MM-004 is a topical
mAb treatment based on (i) bispecific mAb possessing “muco-trapping” Fc and binding domains that
neutralizes both RSV and MPV, and (ii) direct delivery to the lung airways using a vibrating mesh nebulizer. By
concentrating MM004 at the site of infection rather than delivering it systemically, we expect to enable
efficacious and cost-effective treatment for both RSV and MPV, with little risk of adverse side effects, due to
limited systemic adsorption after pulmonary delivery. In RSV-infected neonatal lambs, a highly relevant model
for pediatric RSV, our muco-trapping mAb against RSV greatly reduced infectious RSV viral load in infected
neonatal lambs in lung tissues to non-detectible levels, and reduced bronchiolitis, neutrophil infiltration and
inflammation to levels that were often indistinguishable compared to uninfected animals. Building off this
promising result, we have now engineered a bispecific mAb (MM-004) that potently traps both RSV and MPV
in human AM and facilitates rapid clearance from the mouse lung. In this proposal, we seek to validate in
Phase 1 whether MM004 can effectively treat MPV infections in hamsters, the best available model for MPV. If
successful, we will advance to Phase 2, where we will develop a Master Cell Bank cell line for high yield
production of MM-004 (Aim 1), and conduct a number of IND-enabling studies including, GLP tox studies in
rats, tissue cross reactivity studies, and pre-IND filing (Aim 2). Both Phase 2 Aims are part of the critical path
to quickly advance MM-004 into clinical development, and will put us in a position to file IND within 12 months
from completing this project. Our work will also help pave the way for improved, molecularly-targeted
aerosolized therapies against various respiratory infections.Project Narrative
There are no vaccines or treatments available for either respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or metapneumovirus
(MPV), two of the leading causes of bronchiolitis in young children, immunocompromised adults and the
elderly, which collectively results in millions of infections and tens of thousands of hospitalizations each year in
the U.S alone. To meet the urgent need for a treatment for both, Mucommune is developing MM-004, a muco-
trapping bispecific monoclonal antibody against both RSV and MPV that can quickly clear both viruses from
infected lungs. Building off of our promising data against RSV in lambs, this FastTrack proposal will first
demonstrate in vivo proof-of-concept efficacy in a hamster model of MPV infections in Phase 1, followed by
development of cGMP-compliant cell lines and IND-enabling studies in Phase 2.",  ,,,,RICHARD  CONE,,(410) 336-6598,cone@jhu.edu,,  ,

However, the applicability of such methods to other imaging domains has received much less attention from the Computer Vision community. The lack of high-quality labeled datasets in non-visible domains is continuing to be a significant factor in slowing down commercial and DoD research in applying bleeding-edge Machine Learning methods to non-visible domains. The DoD has a growing need of robust and reliable autonomous systems, in which computer vision tasks will play an increasingly important role across all armed forces and data domains. From autonomous vehicles, such as UAVs, to battle-space-wide situational awareness for command-and-control tasks, there is a critical need to perceive, detect, understand, classify and react to dynamic threats by exploiting a range of sensors and imaging modalities that span a large portion of the electro-magnetic spectrum. In the proposed work Lynntech will evaluate the robustness and limitations of transfer learning, style transfer, and other related methods spanning a number of different tasks of interest to DARPA. Tasks of particular interest include classify and determine the pose of objects as imaged by non-visual wavelengths sensors. This problem becomes particularly difficult for certain classes of objects for which only a few images exist, such as Low-Shot instances. Lynntech will evaluate strategies such as data augmentation, simulations, and style transfer to be able to generate new labeled datasets in the imaging domains of interest, evaluate the performance of existing classifiers, and foster the development of new, more robust, and less brittle algorithms, trainable with limited initial data sets. During the first year of this Phase II effort, Lynntech will partner with other commercial entities to lay down the groundwork in generating labeled data sets in non-visible domains using simulations and style transfer. In year two, Lynntech will focus on the development and strengthening of classifier and detectors in such domains.

Thestable fly is one of the most damaging pests afflicting livestock animals in the USA and aroundthe world. The USA as the largest producer of beef (>12 million tons/yr.) and cow milk (>99million tons/yr.) in the world suffers an estimated annual loss of $402 million in dairy and $2.01billion in the beef industries in the absence of an effective stable fly control solution. In additionexotic zoo animals wild animals and humans also suffer from stable fly bites extending thescope of the problem and the market opportunity for an effective stable fly control solution.Current methods employed for stable fly management are limited primarily focused on sanitationinsecticide treatment and trap deployment. The development of resistance against commonlyused chemical insecticides environmental concerns and failure of vacuum fly traps in controllingstable flies has created an urgent need for novel effective and environmentally safe stable flycontrol technologies. Apex Bait Technologies Inc. will develop a novel blood substitute liquidbait (Apex-FLB) with unique attractants phagostimulants and a chemical insecticide that willensure the attraction and direct consumption of toxicants by stable flies causing completemortality and avoiding resistance development. The objective of this Phase I project is toformulate and optimize the efficiency of the liquid bait in semi-field and field trials. In Phase Iresearch we will gather extensive data on the effectiveness of Apex-FLB formulation in stable flycontrol under diverse environments.

Despite a growing need for smoking cessation services, Latino smokers face notable disparities in cessation
treatment. Consequently, there is a big opportunity, both from a scientific and a business perspective, to develop
and test the most optimal culturally tailored approaches to enroll and engage Latino Smokers into cessation
programs. The Kick Buts program owned by Agile Health has shown to be a highly effective mobile text message-
based smoking cessation program in clinical trials and is now available to more than 1.8 million employees and
patients. However, Latino smokers’ engagement rates in the program are very low. In the STTR Phase I, we
developed and tested a culturally-relevant version of the Kick Buts program in English and Spanish to better
engage, increase quit attempts and improve cessation outcomes among Latino smokers, Latinos Kick Buts
(LKB). The next step to assure the commercialization of the LKB will be to improve the reach, enrollment and
retention in the LKB. In this Phase II our goal is to compare the impact of 4 theory-based text message types
(reward, scarcity, fear/self-efficacy and social norms) on enrollment of Latino smokers into LKB. We will deploy
these messages among Latino smokers served by Hackensack Meridian Health, one of the largest healthcare
systems in the U.S., to increase the enrollment and retention of Latino smokers in the Latinos Kick Buts program.
Latino smokers (N = 2,600) will be randomized to receive up to five messages/week (once a day at different
times of the day and different days of the week) from one of the four message types. Smokers responding to
these messages will be automatically enrolled in the LKB program and begin to receive “quit decision support”
messages designed to guide smokers to develop a personalized quit plan. Two weeks later, smokers who do
not respond to the first type of messages will be re-randomized to receive one of the top two performing message
types arising from the first cycle of messaging. Non-responders to the second cycle will be re-randomized again
to receive another cycle of the top two performing messages. After all three cycles are complete, we expect that
at least 629 Latino smokers will enroll in LKB. We will carefully track engagement, retention, and satisfaction
with LKB. Aim 1. To compare the impact of 4 theory-based text message types on enrollment of Latino smokers
into LKB. Aim 2: To identify days of the week and times of the day most likely to lead to enrollment as well as
understand enrollment into different messages by age, gender, socioeconomic status, and country of birth. Aim
3: To assess engagement and satisfaction with LKB in a clinic population and generate estimates of cessation
among diverse group of Latinos.PROJECT NARRATIVE

Approved human subjects research testing will be applied to the full prototype build in Phase II. While many disparate algorithms exist that claim to modify 2D images and video for a 3D experience, this carefully crafted end-to-end algorithmic pipeline demonstrated by the Phase I proof-of-concept lies on the true cutting edge of technology, providing a full path to automating the conversion of existing 2D video of many types for almost immediate the use, providing warfighters, operators, first responders and others in private enterprise, a way to rapidly create immersive training that has the potential to reduce conflict and save lives. Pervasive, rapid access to immersive training material for adults working in hazardous environments would entirely change our response and the success rate, to missions and daily routines that put American troops and workers in environments that hold potentially lethal dangers. Rapid, immersive experiential contact with such dangers, without actual harm, has already proven a gateway to stronger, safer, more successful results for rapid delivery of much needed training material. The proposed algorithm would eliminate roadblocks to hand created immersive footage, including cost, development time, and realism. A wealth of 3D material could rapidly be assembled into relevant scenarios for training. And, when such 3D immersive training reaches regular schools and universities (the latter may already be introducing such classroom training in certain fields), the landscape may change forever in terms of learning and conceptualization. Additionally, Phase I research has demonstrated that such a product has more than a single use: in addition to providing rapid immersive training footage, the algorithm (incidentally) provides automatic figure rigging, meshing, and texturing for assets used in commercial immersive electronic games. The generation of such assets currently requires highly skilled graphic designers hours, days, and months the create. While such artists would still be necessary for adding the final perfection required by such games, the product results will reduce such preparatory work from weeks to a day or two.

Emulation of the type of down-links used by the Iridium user network will be implemented in the CommLink code.

Sinusitis is a common illness with an annual economic burden of over $8 billion. Each year, 10.7 million people
are diagnosed with acute sinusitis in the U.S. and 80% receive a prescription for antibiotics. However, less
than 10% of sinusitis cases are caused by bacteria; sinusitis accounts for more adult antibiotic prescriptions
than any other outpatient diagnosis. Patients with routine upper respiratory illnesses, such as sinusitis, often
visit primary or urgent care clinics with a predisposition to receive antibiotics without fully appreciating the need
or risks. With 1 in 1000 patients suffering serious, often life-threatening, adverse effects due to antibiotics and
the looming threat of antibiotic resistance, physicians need better tools to diagnose patients with sinusitis.
Often healthcare providers lack point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tools that can reveal the underlying cause of a
patient’s illness. They are forced to rely on imprecise methods to make diagnostic decisions or refer patients
for complex procedures under a specialist’s care.
Currently, there are no products available on the market to diagnose bacterial sinusitis at the point-of-
care. ENTvantage Diagnostics has developed the first rapid, point-of-care diagnostic test kit that can identify
the three pathogens responsible for bacterial sinusitis. Included in this test kit is a specialized mucus collection
device that allows for sampling of the middle meatus, the drainage site of the paranasal sinuses, without the
need for an endoscope or specialized training. Building on our prior successes during prototyping and
feasibility, we have refined a fully multiplexed assay combined with a simple to use sample collection device to
be used at the POC. During this performance period, Entvantage will evaluate the clinical performance of the
Sinu-TestTM Bacterial Assay Kit and reader system. The Sinu-TestTM Bacterial Assay Kit will improve
patient care by providing physicians with a means to accurately diagnose patients with sinusitis who
otherwise would be treated empirically. In addition, this POC test will improve patient safety and
reduce direct and indirect costs to the healthcare system by reducing unnecessary antibiotics
prescribed for sinusitis. The purpose of this renewel is to expand the clinical performance evaluation
to include sufficient native specimens to meet the requirements set by FDA for CLIA-Waiver.",  ,,,,ORIANA E HAWKINS,,(405) 476-1242,oriana@entvantagedx.com,,  ,

ArchieMD is developing a mobile medical training application that will facilitate rapid dissemination of
continuously evolving knowledge and procedural skills to nurses, which will allow staff to quickly expand
capabilities to meet needs in the event of a pandemic. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has put an immense
strain on health care systems worldwide, and the nursing shortage—which long predated the onset of the
pandemic—has further exacerbated the challenge of human resource management as hospitals struggle to take
on the growing number of patients. As a result, many nurses are being re-allocated from other departments and
out-of-hospital positions, assuming new responsibilities for which they have limited training, due to time and
resource constraints and the need for instructor oversight, which places an additional burden on senior staff.
Furthermore, standard-of-care procedures may quickly become outdated as clinicians learn more about the
novel disease, and as hospitals are compelled to modify procedures to better manage limited resources. To
close this gap, ArchieMD proposes to develop a mobile application that will support self-guided instruction,
training, and testing on key respiratory therapy procedures. The mobile app format supports accessibility and
rapid roll-out of updated procedures, and ArchieMDandapos;s dynamic, anatomy-augmented visuals have been
demonstrated to significantly improve learning comprehension. For this Phase I project, ArchieMD will 1) Develop
simulations for oxygen therapy and CPAP administration, incorporating realistic internal anatomy visuals to
support deeper learning, and 2) Carry out a user study to evaluate the performance of the medical training
application in transferring knowledge and skills in these procedures. Additive instructional, training, and testing
modules will leverage incorporated visuals to efficiently convey contextual information in early learning stages
and support long-term retention of concepts. By including dynamic internal anatomy visuals over the virtual
patient, users are able to gain a deeper understanding of the procedureandapos;s real-time impact on the patientandapos;s bodily
functions and health outcomes. Collaboration with nursing students at the University of Michigan for the user
study will demonstrate usability and functionality of the application, as well as inform future development needs.
Successful completion of these specific aims will provide a proof-of-concept for the proposed training platform
and result in development of a minimum viable product. As envisioned, ongoing development will result in a
commercially viable mobile application with a suite of medical procedure training modules, along with in-hospital
task managing features that will assist with distribution of re-allocated staff based on training module completion
status. This technology will support self-guided, just-in-time training to reduce burdens on upper-level staff and
expand the capabilities of the nursing workforce to tend to patients during a current or future pandemic. These
easily accessed training simulations will result in improved clinical skills, a flexible taskforce, and ultimately,
better patient care.Narrative
In the midst of the current pandemic, human resource limitations have compelled hospitals to re-allocate nursing
staff to meet the needs of the overwhelming number of hospital-admitted patients infected with COVID-19.
However, these personnel may have limited training in key clinical procedures such as oxygen therapy and
CPAP administration; systematic training and oversight from already overburdened senior staff is infeasible; and
there is no efficient method to disseminate new information on evolving standard-of-care procedures. ArchieMD
is developing a mobile medical training application with anatomy-augmented visuals that will provide easy access
to high-fidelity, self-guided training, as well as rapid, synchronized roll-out of procedure updates to nurses,
ultimately leading to improved human resource management and patient care during a pandemic.",  ,,,,ROBERT J LEVINE,,(561) 391-4448,rlevine@archiemd.com,,  ,

In keeping with the NIH’s stated priority for the development of vaccines to bacterial zoonoses, our goal is to
develop an effective and conveniently delivered vaccine to protect against the spirochaete, Borrelia burgdorferi,
the causative agent of Lyme disease. The bacterium is vectored by infected Ixodes species ticks between
humans and mammalian reservoirs.
Our chosen antigen candidate is OspA, a surface protein which presents as the spirochaete transits between
the arthropod vector and the mammalian host. Vaccination with this antigen allows protective antibodies to
encounter the spirochaete while still inside the tick as it engorges with a blood meal, and has been shown to be
effective as a transmission blocking vaccine.
In order to develop adequate amounts of antigen for an effective and adequate immune response, we have
established a proprietorial expression system using recombinant maize. An additional advantage of maize
expression is that vaccine antigens can be directly administered through the oral route rather than purified for
injection. In this proposal, our goal is to produce large amounts of OspA antigen candidate in maize, orally
administer the antigen to mice in feed formulated from recombinant maize flour, and demonstrate that the antigen
elicits a protective immune response against challenge.",  ,,,,ERIN  EGELKROUT,,(805) 756-6458,erinegelkrout@appliedbiotech.org,,  ,

This revolutionary approach is already mainstream to breeding species such asdairy cattle in advanced programs. However further expansion of genomic selection to largerpopulations additional breeding programs underserved species and developing countriesrequires greater prediction accuracy at lower genotyping cost. The first challenge can beaddressed by whole genome re-sequencing to generate ultra-high-density DNA marker panels inthe training population. Unfortunately the species that would benefit the most from genomere-sequencing as a genotyping approach such as cattle pigs and fish species havenotoriously repetitive genomes. The drawback of sequencing genomes with high repetitivecontent is that a significant portion of the sequencing cost is spent characterizing theseuninformative regions. Up to 80% of the short-reads generated from a re-sequencing project maybe expected to map to high-copy regions and be discarded during bioinformatic analysis.Addressing the challenge of targeting genome re-sequencing to non-repetitive regions of thegenome will reduce cost increase throughput eliminate wasteful sequencing of non-
informative regions improve the prediction accuracy of genomic selection and increaseaccess to the process to a wider range of producers. Furthermore directing sequencing to non-
repetitive genic and regulatory regions is more likely to uncover variants that impact traits ofimportance. As a strategy to reduce costs further genomes can be sequenced at low sequencingdepth followed by imputation to solve the high missing data inherent to these approaches. Theproblem with this solution is that some markers associated with key genetic conditions andabnormalities cannot be inferred via imputation and remain missing. Therefore an ideal productfor whole-genome sequencing-based genotyping of cattle will involve depleting unwantedrepetitive elements but simultaneously enriching for key regions of the genome. The marketcurrently lacks a product that allows rapid and efficient elimination of repetitive regions fromgenomes while enriching for key variants and that can be readily integrated to standard re-
sequencing pipelines.The goal of this SBIR Phase I is to determine the technical feasibility of GD-Seq aproduct to characterize the cattle genome using an improved whole-genome sequencing-
based genotyping approach. Upon completion of the product we anticipate that regulatory andgenic regions of the genome will be enriched a minimum of 300-500% compared to standardWGS sequencing. Simultaneously the company expects to enrich markers associated with keytraits around 100 times. This will allow sequencing resources to be better allocated towardsimportant regions of the genome and key markers to be accurately genotyped even when the restof the genome is sequenced at low sequencing depth. This product presents a significantimprovement over current methodologies because it will solve major pain points currentlyassociated with SNP chips and other sequencing-based approaches.Anticipated Results and Commercial Applications: The commercial focus of thistechnical project is to facilitate the conversion of genotyping using DNA chip to a newgeneration of genotyping that relies on re-sequencing using GD-seq. The process is highlyscalable and automatable yet remaining cost-effective by improving sequencing data utilization.This provides the opportunities for more animals to be genotyped with higher marker densitywhich will support an industry that increasingly demands higher genetic gains especially onmore complex traits like feed efficiency fertility and animal health.

There are many modern approaches to accessibility in data visualizations, from simple but inadequate
alternative data tables to excellent work with tactile graphics, haptics, and sonification. Each has its benefits
and limitations, but common underlying weaknesses to the advanced methods are lack of precision and need
for reader training. By contrast, most of the 7.7 million Americans with visual disabilities are at least moderately
skilled in using a screen reader. However, this typically limits users to serial data point access, the equivalent
of a data table, which does not provide an equivalent experience to the advantages of data visualizations. It
decreases independence and professional opportunities, increases stress, decreases quality of life, and puts
vulnerable people at risk when crucial public health information is disseminated in graphical-only form, such
as in the current COVID-19 pandemic.
The long range goal of this Phase I project is to create technologies that permit authors and developers of web
sites to effortlessly publish charts, diagrams, and infographics that are fully usable by all people, in particular
people who are blind, low-vision, or have cognitive disabilities. In this Phase I SBIR project, we will assess the
feasibility of creating interactive contextual automatic descriptions that enable the reader to construct an
accurate working mental model of the data with minimal effort and time, to perform tasks and make
decisions.
Fizz Studio has created a software package, Fizz Charts, that generates accessible keyboard-browsable
charts for use on any website. We seek to enhance this with Fizz Reader, a novel interactive interface that
uses natural language generation (NLG) to enable the user to query the chart for quick answers about
each data point, its relationship to other data points and to the chart statistics, and to high-level or detailed
trends and patterns in the data. The effect is of one person explaining the chart to another over the phone,
and providing relevant and rapid answers to help the listener understand as much of the data as they wish for
a core set of 7 common chart types: bar; line; pie; histogram; scatterplot; heatmap; and flowchart.
Aim 1: Develop effective interactive NLG model and engine module
To concisely communicate relevant details to the user, we will design a comprehensive set of tasks for all
supported chart types, and a set of NLG templates for each chart component (e.g. data point, axis, title).
We will use these NLG templates to develop a software module which composes colloquial utterances
from an internal statistical data model we build from the data extracted from the chart. Each set of options
will represent the affordances optimal for the chart type (e.g. comparisons for bar charts, changes over time for
line charts). This module will have a client-server API architecture, to make it adaptable to multiple user
interface modalities, including the screen reader intermediary in Aim 2, as well as a standalone digital assistant
or a component in a smart speaker. To ensure effectiveness and clarity, we will perform multi-phase testing
for usability and task accomplishment with 10-20 blind and low-vision human subjects, and integrate their
feedback. We seek 80% successful task accomplishment across all chart types and tasks.
Aim 2: Implement a browser-based screen reader intermediary User Interface Module (UIM)
To integrate our NLG module directly into the browser, for on-demand presentation of the generated NLG chart
information to users of screen readers, we will implement an option-based interface using JavaScript and
ARIA technologies. Each set of options will be context-dependent on the currently focused item (e.g. data
point, axis, title), and will reflect the optimal tasks for that item in that specific chart type, to enable users to
use keyboard input to select from a virtual dropdown of options, and the results will be returned as text to
be presented by the screen reader or braille display. We will use a Lean development methodology to test for
95% interoperability across common browsers, operating systems, mobile devices, and screen readers.
Conclusion and goals for Phase II
The purpose of this Phase I grant is to significantly advance the state of the art for the accessibility of data
charts for people with visual disabilities to aid them in their personal and professional lives. In Phase II, we will
build on this foundation to support more complex diagram types including schematics, refine the UI for more
operations, and explore other deployments such as smart speakers, browser extensions, or app plugins.Project Narrative

Thrombus as a clinical entity is responsible for the largest number of deaths and greatest morbidity compared to
any other pathology. Most major cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, acute
coronary syndrome, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis, are either a result of thrombosis or
can cause thrombosis. Recently, the pandemic COVID-19 has been found to be associated with increased
coagulopathy, which likely contributes to the development of acute respiratory distress and even multi-organ
failure in these patients. Detection of thromboemboli and their source thrombus are vital to proper patient
management across all of these diseases. Currently thrombi are detected by different anatomical imaging
methods depending on the vascular territory, but all techniques have limitations (e.g. require sedation, require
nephrotoxic contrast, cannot be used in certain patients). No existing method can be used to assess different
vascular territories for thrombus in a single multistation exam, while this would be extremely valuable in
thromboembolic diseases like deep vein thrombosis (DVT) / pulmonary embolism (PE) or stroke where it is
important to not only detect the embolus but the embolic source as well. Current methods do not inform on
composition of the thrombus and the fibrin content, although therapeutic strategies (e.g., thrombolysis for a fibrin
rich clot identified by positron emission tomography (PET) vs. mechanical thrombectomy for an organized, fibrin-
poor, chronic thrombus) would benefit from such information.
Collagen Medical is developing a fibrin-specific molecular PET probe, 68Ga-CM500 that can identify thrombus
anywhere in the body following a single intravenous injection followed by PET imaging. Ultimately, we are
seeking regulatory approval for the indication “68Ga-CM500 detects thrombus” which require demonstration of
efficacy for thrombus detection in different vascular territories, such as the deep veins, pulmonary arteries, and
cardiac chambers. Using a closely related probe, we have excellent preliminary human data to suggest that
68Ga-CM500 can accurately identify thrombus in the heart. The purpose of this CRP grant is to provide funding
to 1) file an IND for 68Ga-CM500, 2) perform safety, pharmacokinetic, and dosimetry evaluations in healthy
volunteers, and 3) obtain proof of concept data that 68Ga-CM500 can detect thrombus in the deep veins and
pulmonary arteries of patients with deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism.
The probe 68Ga-CM500 displays high affinity for fibrin, fast blood clearance, and high metabolic stability. In rat

The goal of this Commercialization Readiness Pilot program is to evaluate 68Ga-CM500, as a tool to
noninvasively diagnose thrombosis in patients. We have already prepared a batch of solid drug substance
precursor under cGMP conditions. Clearance, elimination and biodistribution have been assessed in two animal
species (rat and rabbit), and a single dose toxicity study in rats was conducted under GLP conditions. Because
of the microdose given with PET an abbreviated nonclinical safety package is required for an Investigational
New Drug (IND) application and we have already met these requirements. This CRP program will enable us to
file an IND and obtain key preliminary data in volunteers and patients with PE/DVT. Human data is crucial for
attracting investment and ultimate commercialization.
First, we will conduct late-stage nonclinical activities necessary for 68Ga-CM500 to be administered to humans
by finalizing, assembling, and submitting an IND application. We will then assess the pharmacokinetics,
distribution, and elimination of 68Ga-CM500 in healthy volunteers to establish safety, radiochemical dose, and to
estimate an optimal time for thrombus imaging, followed by proof of concept studies in patients with known deep
vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism.Project Narrative
Thrombus as a clinical entity is responsible for the largest number of deaths and greatest morbidity compared to
any other pathology. Recently, the pandemic COVID-19 has been found to be associated with increased
coagulopathy, which likely contributes to the development of acute respiratory distress and even multi-organ
failure in these patients. No existing method can be used to assess different vascular territories for thrombus in
a single multistation exam, while this would be extremely valuable. Collagen Medical is developing a fibrin-
specific molecular PET probe, 68Ga-CM500 that can identify thrombus anywhere in the body following a single
intravenous injection followed by PET imaging.",  ,,,,VALERIE  HUMBLET,,(617) 642-0585,vhumblet@cmed.cc,,  ,

Diabetes is rapidly becoming a global health crisis. Depending on the type of statistical methodology used, the
world-wide incidence of the most common type of diabetes, adult-onset or Type II, is estimated to be in the range
of 285 million. In both Type I and Type II diabetics glycemic control is paramount as the inability to maintain
glycemic control results in several secondary complications including neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy,
that often lead to amputations, dialysis and blindness as well as increased risk of cardiovascular complications.
For the majority of diabetics glycemic control requires constant vigilance and monitoring of blood glucose levels.
The overarching goal of this project is the development of a novel glucose responsive insulin (GRI) with a
reversible, glucose dependent response at the insulin receptor. The full realization of the GRI concept would
most closely mimic the benefits of a healthy pancreas and maintain euglycemia, reduce/eliminate the need for
constant monitoring, and ultimately, reduce/eliminate the complications of diabetes. The scope of this proposal
is the design and testing of a series of analogs that can bind glucose allosterically and demonstrate differential
response at the insulin receptor. This will be achieved through completion of three aims. In Aim 1 we will use a
novel computational platform to design and produce a series of GRIs with glucose binding affinity in the
physiological range. In Aim 2 we will determine the glucose binding affinity of the analogues produced in Aim 1.
Finally, in Aim 3 we will measure the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin like growth factor (IGF-R1) affinity of the
GRI’s in the presence of glucose at physiological concentrations. Completion of these Aims will result in the
identification of several GRI lead candidates with glucose binding in the physiological range and reversible
glucose dependent insulin receptor binding and absence of IGF-1R binding.",  ,,,,PAWEL  FLUDZINSKI,,(303) 604-0296,pawel.fludzinski@amidebio.com,,  ,

Chronic pain affects 20% of U.S. adults and costs $600 billion annually. Opioids are often the first treatment option offered to patients with chronic pain. Currently pain is assessed using simplistic, subjective and generalized visual/verbal scales (1-10) with little ability to localize the origin. It is essential for clinicians and medical researchers to have calibrated and accurate measures of pain to assist patients in determining the underlying disease and directing patients to the most effective therapies. This project will develop a new biomedical tool to quantify pain data for multimodal treatment plans to potentially minimize opioid use. This tool will improve quality of life for people suffering from chronic pain and help those on opioids find better therapies. Furthermore, it will help clinicians with varied levels of training and experience achieve the highest level of exam skill. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will digitize a physical exam by capturing palpation location and pressure and patient pain expression via multiple biosensors to create a personalized “contour” map of pain intensity onto a 3D image of the human body. This comprehensive and calibrated data set can then be used to assist clinicians in developing a more accurate differential diagnosis for the underlying pain condition. This project will advance the hardware and software components for future integration with augmented reality and artificial intelligence modules.

The CDB Productivity API is containerized to transform the sensor data as it was recognized (points, imagery raster, meshed data) and produces the appropriate OGC CDB layers. Potential solutions may use OGC CDB raster material data and imagery signatures to improve segmentation and then apply those material codes to the polygonal surfaces to improve the data for simulation applications. If the data can be edge matched via pattern recognition to existing imagery to transform it into the correct location on the earth’s surface, it will improve the geospatial accuracy of the source data. Once the data is in the right location then the data needs to be segmented to provide a good Digital Terrain Model or Digital Elevation Model, and the rest of the 3D features extracted into OGC CDB models. AI/ML algorithms will be used to train and then invoke these transformation procedures, reducing the need for manual intervention to pick tie points between the imagery and the vector data after enough tie points are established to transform the vector data to the imagery to correlate the data. Team TAC offers a SOF unique, containerized interface for the creation, maintenance and execution of analytics models and training data focused on the transformation of small tactical UAS meshed terrain to simulation and GEOINT ready data. This interface enables users to create analytics models based on their ideas to experiment within the AUTO 3D architecture. This interface enables users to produce training datasets to empower the analytics models with diverse and quality datasets. The results of the experiments visualize within the containerized interface for users to tune their ideas. A key component of this interface is a Knowledge Management Capability to associate and configuration manage analytics models to training datasets. Team TAK will deliver analytics models and training datasets for segmentation, object detection and data restoration. The segmentation model focuses on a segmenting classic 3D objects from a mesh. This segmentation model will decompose the mesh into individual 3D objects (i.e. classic M&S 3D models) and terrain. The segmentation and object detection analytics models work in tandem to identify unique objects (i.e. a building or tree) within a 2D plane. Once an object is detected within a 2D plane, the segmentation analytics model removes the mesh components within a 3D space into singular mesh constructs. The singular mesh constructs are restored to address the oddities of all tactical UAS meshed terrain such as “holes in the mesh”, unnecessary mesh triangles and non-orthogonal planes (i.e. rippled instead of straight walls).",sbir@socom.mil  sbir@socom.mil,,,sbir@socom.mil,John  Ferry,,(740) 317-7424,sbir@socom.mil,,  ,

The resulting thin films may then be either applied directly to fabric or other surfaces, or chopped into small-dimensional flakes, surface functionalized, and used as an aqueous-dispersed dye or surface-applied pigment. By varying the thickness and internal multi-layer structure of the films, dichroic pigments across the entire visible color spectrum can be produced. Due to the chemistries of different fabric and other substrate molecules, different surface functionalization chemistries will be needed to optimize the coloring of different materials. NanoSonic will also work with a textile company who will serve as both a development partner and potential customer to evaluate how the materials may be used to dye their products, and with the U.S. manufacturer of specialized extrusion equipment to investigate how the dichroic sheet material manufacturing process may be optimized and up-scaled. The proposed technology to fabricate dichroic particles will not produce the harmful by-products resulting from some traditional methods of dyestuff production and will be amenable to a variety of fiber types and fabric structures.

Studies indicate that from 12% to over 50% of soft serve ice cream machines are contaminatedwith unsatisfactory levels of bacteria. Contamination issues are due largely to the complex and costlydisassembly cleaning and sanitizing (DCS) process required for all machines currently on the market. TheDCS process can cost businesses well over $8000 for each machine per year in wasted product labor andsupplies. In addition significant potential revenue is lost when the machine is out of service for cleaning.Inventherm is developing commercial soft serve ice cream and slush machines (SSMs) that virtuallyeliminates the DCS process produces aseptic or sterile products and slashes operating costs by severalthousand dollars per machine annually. While not the focus of the current development Inventherm'stechnology can also be applied for producing sterile saline slush which is used in surgical procedures forreducing tissue damage.Inventherm's process for freezing soft serve differs substantially from the method used in conventionalequipment. During the Phase I effort Inventherm's processing technology will be experimentally verified onequipment designed and constructed as part of the project work. It is anticipated that Inventherm willdemonstrate that it's technology can produce soft serve with a quality equal to that of conventional softserve machines while eliminating the need for disassembly cleaning and sanitizing of the SSM.Global revenue from soft serve machine sales was approximately $814 million in 2018 and is expected toexceed $1 billion by 2024. Global sales are dominated by North America Europe and China. North Americaholds 35% of the market with revenue of $283.5 million. Inventherm's SSM can also be used for makingfrozen beverages. The estimated market size for frozen beverages also approaches $1 billion.Inventherm's primary competition is from conventional soft serve machine manufacturers. There is virtuallyno product differentiation across all current manufacturers. This lack of innovation has allowed foreigncompetition to dominate the world market once controlled by US manufacturers. Inventherm's SSM ispoised to disrupt a technologically stagnant global industry and bring much of the manufacturing back tothe U.S.Inventherm has contacted multiple business owners restaurant equipment suppliers and a majorrestaurant equipment manufacturer to get feedback and market data. Response has been 100% positive.They are all aware that the current DCS process is expensive and burdensome. Multiple businesses areinterested in field testing Inventherm's SSMs when they are ready. An initial assessment indicates that themanufacturing cost for Inventherm's SSM will be similar to conventional soft serve machines.Note: Proprietary information is italicized in this proposal. 1,  ,,,,Jason Hugenroth  Hugenroth,,(225) 247-3555,jason.hugenroth@inventherm.com,,  ,

Heart failure (HF) is the most common cause for both hospitalizations and readmissions in the Medicare program.
HF’s high mortality rate and high hospitalization utilization rate via readmissions results in a large economic
burden currently estimated at over $30B, and prevalence of HF is expected to continue rising by 46% by 2030.
There is an opportunity to deploy remote patient monitoring (RPM) tools for measuring prognostic biomarkers of
worsening HF and acute decompensation and hospital readmission. Bender Tech (BT) has developed a urine
testing platform capable of easily attaching to a home-toilet for accurate and easy collection of longitudinal health
and behavior data without the requirement of manual sample collection and/or testing. We propose to adapt our
system for use in elderly HF patient populations by rendering data collection and transmission completely passive.
We propose to integrate sensors and firmware capable of identifying when a user has used their home toilet
(Specific Aim 1), develop the machine learning (ML) classification algorithms necessary for determining when to
perform a testing sequence (Specific Aim 2), and use ML methods to demonstrate feasibility of user biometric
identification via urinary testing data (Specific Aim 3). A successful outcome of this proposal will be a set of
classification models built using ML techniques designed to enable passive collection of longitudinal urine profile
data from a home-toilet for use in remotely managing elderly HF patients. This will ready the product for
prospective clinical trials that would be the subject of a future phase II submission for use in remotely monitoring
diuretic effectiveness and preventing hospital readmissions.Project Narrative
Remotely stratifying risk of worsening heart failure and predicting imminent decompensation and hospitalizations
using remote patient monitoring devices can help lower healthcare costs and improve lives for the elderly living
with heart failure at home. Longitudinal urinary trend data of physiologically important markers, such as spot
sodium tests, have been shown to help classify potentially stable heart failure patients, predict acute
decompensation, and measure diuretic effectiveness via relative changes from baseline measurements. Bender
Tech proposes to integrate the hardware and machine learning methods necessary to render its internet-
connected home urine testing platform completely passive to enable use by the elderly HF population and obviate
any need for device interaction for data collection and transmission.",  ,,,,BRIAN F BENDER,,(910) 988-1333,brian@bender.tech,,  ,

Aging sewer infrastructure coupled with a growing population and sewer demand in the US have fostered a shift to higher usage of onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS). In the US, decentralized wastewater systems are used in 25% of existing residential homes and 33% of new development. The revenue for the OWTS market is growing as well, which was projected to nearly double from 2010 ($2.35 billion) to 2020 ($4.57 billion). Although becoming more prevalent, OWTSs are either very basic (i.e. septic tanks) or utilize technologies that create concentrated brine and/or sludge streams which require occasional emptying & transport via vacuum truck, and further treatment at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The proposed ZeWa system seeks to not only eliminate these brine streams, but capture the high energy content they contain and convert them to high-value onsite reuse products. By optimizing all reuse potential of wastewater, ZeWa can shift black- and greywater treatment nationally to net energypositive while offsetting energy costs across the municipal water & wastewater, septage, and agriculture sectors. 

The ZeWa system is an onsite black- and greywater treatment technology that maximizes the chemical energy potential contained in wastewater to produce zero-waste and three valuable output streams: a. clean water for non-potable reuse, b. concentrated fertilizer for local nutrient supply, and c. Class A biosolids for local soil amendment. The ZeWa system consists of three subsystems; 1. sludge treatment and energy recovery subsystem (STERS), 2. water recovery subsystem (WRS) and 3. nutrient recovery subsystem (NRS). The team already possesses functional prototypes of the WRS and NRS for testing. The key innovation and primary goal of Phase I is the development and testing of the STERS to validate the onsite treatment of a blackwater sludge/brine stream with only energy produced directly from the blackwater sludge. This validation will facilitate two key breakthroughs in onsite domestic wastewater treatment: 1. elimination of concentrate/brine streams through recycle and treatment of the concentrate and 2. elimination of required emptying and transport of sludge in OWTS via vacuum truck. The technical risk for this proposal is low as the ZeWa system, and specifically the STERS, leverages and integrates components developed by the team over the past decade of onsite wastewater treatment research.",April  Richards,SBIR Program Manager,(202) 564-6462,richards.april@epa.gov,Tate W Rogers,Owner and Principal,(336) 414-0252,tate@triangle-environmental.com,,  ,

depression and long-term maintenance (BPD), a mental disorder that affects ~6 million adult Americans. Existing
drug classes are relatively ineffective and very few new modes-of-action have been developed in the past 40+
years. This is due, in part, to the biopharma industry’s focus on drugging single molecular targets, and the lack

discovery paradigm combines custom-designed privileged chemotypes with a proven deep behavioral profiling
method. Successful Phase I studies using this novel, but previously validated, approach resulted in the discovery
and optimization of a novel lead compound for the treatment of BPD. The therapeutic utility of drug candidates
was confirmed using molecular target profiling, ex vivo imaging of the forebrain circuits implicated in BPD and
predictive translational medicine biomarkers. Phase II studies are focused on advancing the lead compound
through Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies, the necessary next step for FDA review and approval
of human studies. Aims include: (1) quantification of the preclinical therapeutic (safety) margin for the lead, or
superior back-up molecule, including analyses of antidepressant activity; (2) confirmation of an enhanced EEG
gamma band as a reliable translational biomarker of BPD drug activity and efficacy in non-human primates; (3)
manufacture and qualification of cGLP drug product suitable for IND-enabling studies; and (4) completion of
preclinical studies necessary for an IND filing with the FDA, including standard absorption, distribution,
metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/TOX) preclinical studies and preclinical dose escalation studies
necessary prior to first-in-human clinical studies. The successful completion of these aims will result in a Type B
meeting to obtain guidance from the FDA and the filing of an IND package. The Blue Oak Pharmaceuticals team

In the United States, nearly 100,000 patients receive general anesthesia and sedation daily to safely undergo
surgical and non-surgical procedures. A high proportion of these patients are older than 65 years of age. These
older patients are at higher risk of post-operative delirium and cognitive dysfunction. Many of these older patients
have dementia, including mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease, further elevating their risk of POD
and POCD. Anesthesiologists are familiar with how to adjust anesthetic management to account for changes in
systemic physiology in older patients, e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, or respiration. Unfortunately, with existing
technologies, anesthesiologists have no physiologically principled way to account for age-dependent changes
in the brain’s response to anesthetic drugs. Today’s anesthetic brain monitors were developed in the 1990’s
and do not account for recently-described age-dependent changes in brain activity during anesthesia. When
these now outdated monitors are used, older patients are up to 10-times more likely to receive more anesthesia
than necessary to maintain unconscious. In short, currently available anesthetic brain monitors are based on
outdated science and technology and predispose older patients to unnecessarily high anesthetic exposures.
The consequences for older patients and patients with dementia and/or Alzheimer’s disease can be significant,
since increased anesthetic exposure is associated with increased incidence of delirium, post-operative cognitive
dysfunction, and even mortality. PASCALL Systems, Inc. proposes to develop novel systems and personalized
algorithms to monitor aging, dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease patients during general anesthesia and sedation.PROJECT NARRATIVE

Presently, nuclear material identification requires samples to be collected and sent to laboratories for analysis using large and expensive equipment, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers (ICP-MS) or secondary-ion mass spectrometers (SIMS). This can take weeks to obtain results, and utmost care must be taken to ensure the integrity of the sample. Optical techniques, such as laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) and tunable diode laser absorption (TDLAS), show potential as viable field detectors for nuclear materials. However, field LIBS instruments suffer from poor spectral resolution to detect isotopic shifts of nuclear materials while TDLAS lack broad spectral coverage for multi-species detection. To overcome these limitations, we propose a fiber-based dual comb spectrometer (DCS) that provides both broad spectral coverage and high spectral resolution in a compact form factor. In recent work we have demonstrated the feasibility of this DFC approach by identifying and resolving isotopic and ground state hyperfine splittings in rubidium following a single laser ablation shot, as well as identification of multiple species simultaneously utilizing the inherently broad optical bandwidth of the DCS. In this Phase I effort, we will demonstrate the feasibility of fiber-based DFC as a compact field analyzer of trace elements capable of high resolving power to isotopes shifts and their ratio of nuclear surrogate materials over a broad spectral range.

There is increasing appreciation of a syndrome in which patients female patients, present with chest
pain due to myocardial ischemia and have a normal or near normal coronary angiogram. Termed
coronary microvascular dysfunction (MVD) this disorder is not benign with cardiovascular event rates
similar to those with established coronary artery disease. Clinical tools are therefore needed to both
identify MVD patients and better understand the mechanisms causing myocardial ischemia. There is
evidence that myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) provides incremental information in the
evaluation of patients with coronary artery disease, myocardial viability, or diseases of the
microvasculature. Despite data demonstrating the diagnostic and prognostic benefit of MCE in
evaluating patients with MVD, its clinical use has been limited to only a handful of experts in the field,
because there are currently no widely available clinical tools to support MCE quantitative analysis and
interpretation. The overall aim of this Phase I proposal is to provide clinicians with a new tool to
evaluate the myocardial flow-function relationship that is critical to identifying patients with MVD by
using echocardiography. We will develop clinical software that can rapidly process MCE data into a
standardized, quantitative and easy- to- interpret format. In Aim 1, the power of image averaging and
computer aided assessment of radial wall thickening will be used to enhance the current standard of care
which relies solely on readersandapos; visual estimation of segmental function. An algorithm will be developed to
rearrange the order of images so that images representing the same phase of the cardiac cycle are
grouped together. Functional analysis will then be developed using computer-aided tracings of epicardial
and endocardial borders. In Aim 2, a software module for quantitative analysis of real-time MCE
perfusion will be developed that will incorporate statistical confidence, derived from the performance of
image processing algorithms to inform the interpreter about the data strength. Machine learning will be
utilized to train and deploy a neural network for the pixel-by-pixel assessment of myocardial perfusion.
In Aim 3, we will combine myocardial perfusion and function modules into a novel, perfusion-function
mode of imaging (PF-mode). This new mode will be applied to an archival sample of clinically diagnosed
MVD cases to demonstrate the feasibility to detect abnormalities in the myocardial flow-function
relationship. The composite PF-mode will include a cine-loop rendered for one cardiac cycle where
parametric images (perfusion) are superimposed over averaged ultrasound images with an overlay of
graphic representation of wall thickness (function). This novel mode of imaging provides the means to
diagnose MVD in a single clinical study.Project Narrative
Project Title: Reading workstation for clinical contrast echocardiography
Despite a wealth of evidence that myocardial contrast echocardiography imaging of myocardial perfusion
provides incremental information in the evaluation of patients with diseases of the myocardial
microvasculature (MVD), its clinical use has been limited to only a handful of experts in the field. In this
proposal, we have created a multidisciplinary partnership between physicians-scientists and engineers with the
overall aim to address this clinical gap that exists between a proven echocardiographic technique and the
technology necessary to enable widespread adoption of MCE clinically. We will develop a software program
enabling a new method for evaluating the myocardial flow-function relationship using echocardiography that
will enable the identification of MVD using MCE studies at the level of expert readers.",  ,,,,JIRI  SKLENAR,,(503) 442-9273,jiri@narnar.co,,  ,
BERENDO SCIENTIFIC LLC,Natural Sleep Endoscopy system for obstructive sleep apnea: improving the measurement of pattern of airway obstruction and treatment outcomes,Department of Health and Human Services,National Institutes of Health,Phase I,SBIR,R43HL154958,1R43HL154958-01A1,3/1/21,8/31/21,PA19-273,2019.0,4/6/20,4/22/20,NHLBI,2021.0,246784.0,GLDBKR8CUMS3,117174481,N,N,N,1.0,,269 S IRVING BLVD,,LOS ANGELES,California,90004-3809,"We propose to develop a system for natural sleep endoscopy (NSE) - the direct visual
examination of the pharynx during natural sleep – to define the anatomical pattern of obstruction
for individual patients and guide treatment selection in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is a
disorder of repeated upper airway obstruction during sleep that is associated with substantial
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, endocrine disturbances, daytime somnolence,
decreased quality of life, and motor vehicle crashes. About 25-40% of OSA patients cannot
tolerate first-line treatment (positive airway pressure) and may consider other options. Oral
appliances, surgery, and hypoglossal nerve stimulation offer substantial benefit for selected
patients, albeit with associated risks, expense. Outcomes are often unpredictable but are
associated with an individual patient’s pattern of airway obstruction. Current approaches of
determining pattern of obstruction have important limitations related to validity, feasibility, and
cost. NSE is the most likely gold standard, but it has been limited to small studies in the
research laboratory or hospital without widespread use, for multiple reasons: trained personnel
required, lack of appropriate video recording equipment, substantial cost, and arousal when
moving the endoscope to visualize the two major regions of the pharynx. Drug-induced sleep
endoscopy incorporates unconscious sedation, avoiding the latter issue but adding risks of
administering sedation and validity concerns because unconscious sedation is not natural sleep.
Our strategy for meeting this challenge is an endoscopic system for NSE: two cameras
incorporated into an endoscopic catheter, microphone, accelerometer (head position), and the
embedded system to record the audiovisual and position data in a patient-worn system
mounting device. This Phase I SBIR proposal includes developing the endoscopic system and
performing a limited evaluation of safety and feasibility. Aim 1: Design and manufacture dual
camera endoscopic catheter. The catheter will incorporate two existing cameras with an
integrated lens, light source, and sheath. The catheter will provide signal output to a patient-
worn system mounting device for data capture during sleep. Aim 2: Design and manufacture
patient-worn system mounting device. The head-worn system mounting device will include a
microphone, accelerometer, power source, and data recording capability. Aim 3: Perform pilot
safety and feasibility study. We will enroll 10 study participants with mild to moderate OSA
who will undergo polysomnography and simultaneous evaluation with the NSE system. Adverse
events (epistaxis, pain), usability, and acceptance will be measured. Efficacy will be examined.The proposed research is relevant to public health because obstructive sleep apnea is a
disorder of repeated upper airway obstruction during sleep that is associated with substantial
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, endocrine disturbances, daytime somnolence,
decreased quality of life, and motor vehicle crashes and because many patients do not tolerate
first-line therapy (positive airway pressure). Outcomes of alternative treatments (oral appliances,
surgery, and hypoglossal nerve stimulation) are associated with the anatomical pattern of
obstruction. We propose to develop a system for natural sleep endoscopy - the direct visual
examination of the pharynx during natural sleep – as the likely gold standard for defining the
anatomical pattern of obstruction and guiding selection of alternative treatments in obstructive
sleep apnea.",  ,,,,ERIC J KEZIRIAN,,(323) 442-5790,eric.kezirian@med.usc.edu,,  ,

This project will develop quantitative imagining and machine learning technology that will allow pediatricians to evaluate and monitor the infant’s head development during well-child visits and/or remotely. If a child is diagnosed with head deformations, early and effective therapy can be initiated. Thus, a major impact of this project is significant reduction of the number of children with cranial deformations who remain untreated and are exposed to potential health risks. Improved clinical management of these conditions will potentially lower the associated healthcare costs and improve patient outcome. Our technology will be packaged as a smartphone or tablet app, enabling access to lower-resourced communities and patients without access to specialized clinics, as well as enabling care in periods of social distancing and reduced clinical services. This project will ultimately increase awareness of the risks of head deformations and improve pediatric health outcomes. This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop quantitative imaging and machine learning algorithms that accurately measure the cranial shape and size using photos of the infant head taken with a smartphone. These parameters are commonly used to monitor child development, and in the diagnosis and treatment planning of common conditions with head deformations. In this project, we will fully automate the measurements using neural networks and maximize accuracy with regression models accounting for endogenous variables, such as sex and age. To generate accurate head shape measurements even during operation by novice users, our new algorithms based on machine learning will automatically select better images to detect and classify the type of cranial deformation. By addressing errors related to novice use of the tool, such as correcting for variations in the use of the camera, the technology will ensure compliance and accessibility to operators with variable technological skills. Furthermore, we will advance reconstruction of the three-dimensional cranial shape utilizing modern smart device technologies. This approach can handle object motion and can be implemented directly on a smartphone/tablet to compute full three-dimensional shape analysis.

(HBV). Nearly 1 million patients died from HBV related liver diseases each year. HBV
treatment with interferons and nucleos/tide analogues or new drugs face two challenges: 1.
Can’t achieve sustained antiviral efficacy and drug withdrawal frequently leads to HBV relapse
and flares up of liver injury, outcomes of which can be severe or fatal; and 2. Rarely cure HBV
infection after many years of treatment. A key step should be taken to reach the goal of HBV
functional cure set by NIH and FDA, i.e. developing new HBV drugs that aim at achieving
durable antiviral efficacy of HBV treatment and allow drug cessation without HBV relapse. HBV
drug withdrawal lifts inhibition of HBV replication, leading to producing and releasing more
virions that will infect more cells, i.e. HBV relapse, because of insufficient anti-HBs antibody that
can’t match HBV particle level, leaving virions unneutralized, facilitating new spreads of infection
or HBV relapse. Thus, the fundamental problem causing HBV relapse after drug stops is a lack
of sufficient anti-HBs antibody, which is associated with defects in HBsAg-specific B cells. To
effectively address this significant challenge of non-durable antiviral efficacy of HBV therapy,
endogenous anti-HBs production must be expanded independently of B cells. HBVtech aims to
develop AAV vector-based gene therapy to expand endogenous anti-HBs production capacity.
To develop this new therapy, HBVtech must establish two in vivo feasibilities: 1. ability to
express sustained high level of anti-HBs; and 2. the expressed anti-HBs antibodies being
capable of blocking HBV infection in HBV infected chimeric mice. HBVtech has constructed four
AAV anti-HBs vectors that carry anti-HBs genes for expressing anti-HBs antibody.
Subsequently, HBVtech evaluated the in vivo expression ability of each AAV-anti-HBs vector in
mice and has proven the first ability that three of four AAV-anti-HBs vectors can express high
level (andgt;100?g/ml) of anti-HBs antibodies for at least 25-week in transduced mice. This proven
ability to express sustained high level of anti-HBs antibody by AAV vectors has laid the critical
foundation for the success of this drug. The objective of this Phase I study is to ascertain the 2nd
ability that the expressed anti-HBs by three AAV-anti-HBs vectors effectively blocks in vivo HBV
infection by establishing durable efficacy after entecavir stops. By completing this phase I study,
two key in vivo feasibilities will have been established. HBVtech will file new patent application
to protect AAV-anti-HBs vectors. Three AAV-anti-HBs vectors will enter phase II development. If
successful, this new HBV therapy will shorten infinite HBV treatment to a finite course and
benefit millions of patients, representing a critical progress in HBV cure.NARRATIVE
This project aims to develop a new hepatitis B virus (HBV) drug that constantly block new
expansions of HBV infection after current HBV treatment stops. Thus, this new HBV therapy is
expected to establish durable efficacy of hepatitis B treatment, shorten lifetime treatment to a
